Since it's financial data, one would assume they would provide us:\n\n* Individual transaction amounts\n* Aggregated (summed) transactions per day\n* Aggregated transactions per week / month / year\n* Diffrent types of financial transactions, such as amount in account1, account2, or loan amounts, savings account amounts, etc.\n\nExamining the data and especially in light of Giba's comment, we know that our target value is frequently in our dataset. Moreover, just by virtue of the sheer number of columns, I believe it reasonable to assume that at minimal, we're looking at individual transactions. If that is indeed the case, is there a way we can for certain discern if there are aggregate columns present in the dataset? Or conversly, prove for certain that there are not?

Over the recent past, we’ve been fortunate to have may implementations of boosted trees – each with their own unique characteristics.\nIn this notebook, I will implement LightGBM, XGBoost and CatBoost to tackle this Kaggle problem.\n\n**What is  Boosting**\n\nTo understand the absolute basics of the need for Boosting algorithm, lets ask a basic question - If a data point is incorrectly predicted by our first model, and then the next (probably all models), will combining the predictions provide better results? Such questions are handled by boosting algorithm.\n\nSo, Boosting is a sequential technique which works on the principle of an ensemble, where each subsequent model attempts to correct the errors of the previous model. The succeeding models are dependent on the previous model.\n\nThe basic principle behind the working of the boosting algorithm is to generate multiple weak learners and combine their predictions to form one strong rule. These weak rules are generated by applying base Machine Learning algorithms on different distributions of the data set. These algorithms generate weak rules for each iteration. After multiple iterations, the weak learners are combined to form a strong learner that will predict a more accurate outcome.\n Note that a weak learner is one which is slightly better than random guessing. For example, a decision tree whose predictions are slightly better than 50%.\n\n **Gradient Boosting** works by sequentially adding predictors to an ensemble, each one correcting its predecessor. However, instead of tweaking the instance weights at every iteration like AdaBoost does, this method tries to fit the new predictor to the residual errors made by the previous predictor.\n\n**Here’s how the algorithm works**:\n\n**Step 1**: The base algorithm reads the data and assigns equal weight to each sample observation.\n\n**Step 2**: False predictions made by the base learner are identified. In the next iteration, these false predictions are assigned to the next base learner with a higher weightage on these incorrect predictions.\n\n**Step 3**: Repeat step 2 until the algorithm can correctly classify the output.\n\nTherefore, the main aim of Boosting is to focus more on miss-classified predictions.\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/OpP7D0X.png)\n\n[Source](https://catboost.ai/news/catboost-enables-fast-gradient-boosting-on-decision-trees-using-gpus)\n\nThese techniques are used to build ensemble models in an iterative way. On the first iteration, the algorithm learns the first tree to reduce the training error, shown on left-hand image above. The right-hand image above, shows the second iteration, in which the algorithm learns one more tree to reduce the error made by the first tree. The algorithm repeats this procedure until it builds a decent quality mode.\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/OpP7D0X.png)\n\nThe common approach for classification uses Logloss while regression optimizes using root mean square error. Ranking tasks commonly implements some variation of LambdaRank.","metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer, CountVectorizer\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import TruncatedSVD\nfrom sklearn import preprocessing, model_selection, metrics\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport lightgbm as lgb\nimport xgboost as xgb\nfrom catboost import CatBoostRegressor\n\nfrom IPython.display import display # Allows the use of display() for DataFrames\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-19T10:22:47.783908Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-19T10:22:47.784257Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-19T10:22:50.909434Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-19T10:22:47.784224Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-19T10:22:50.908645Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!nvidia-smi","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-19T10:22:50.913473Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-19T10:22:50.913742Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-19T10:22:51.618877Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-19T10:22:50.913715Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-19T10:22:51.618104Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df = pd.read_csv('../input/santander-value-prediction-challenge/train.csv')\n\n# Given the test.csv file is huge, reading which each time during development\n# takes couple of minutes -

It is considered to be a fast processing algorithm.\n\nWhile other algorithms trees grow horizontally, LightGBM algorithm grows vertically, meaning it grows leaf-wise and other algorithms grow level-wise. LightGBM chooses the leaf with large loss to grow. It can lower down more loss than a level wise algorithm when growing the same leaf.\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/pzOP2Lb.png)\n\n[Source of Image](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2017/06/which-algorithm-takes-the-crown-light-gbm-vs-xgboost/)\n\nLight GBM is prefixed as Light because of its high speed. Light GBM can handle the large size of data and takes lower memory to run.\n\nAnother reason why Light GBM is so popular is because it focuses on accuracy of results. LGBM also supports GPU learning and thus data scientists are widely using LGBM for data science application development.\n\n**Leaf growth technique in LightGBM**\n\nLightGBM uses leaf-wise (best-first) tree growth. It chooses to grow the leaf that minimizes the loss, allowing a growth of an imbalanced tree. Because it doesn’t grow level-wise, but leaf-wise, over-fitting can happen when data is small. In these cases, it is important to control the tree depth.\n\n### When to use LightGBM ?\n\nLightGBM is not preferred for a small volume of datasets as it can easily overfit small data due to its sensitivity. Hence, it generally advised for data having more than 10,000+ rows, though there is no fixed threshold that helps in deciding the usage of LightGBM.\n\n## What are LightGBM Parameters?\n\nWhile, LightGBM has more than 100 parameters that are given in the [documentation of LightGBM](https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM), let's checkout the most important ones.\n\n#### Control Parameters\n\n**Max depth**: It gives the depth of the tree and also controls the overfitting of the model. If you feel your model is getting overfitted lower down the max depth.\n\n**Min_data_in_leaf**: Leaf minimum number of records also used for controlling overfitting of the model.\n\n**Feature_fraction**: It decides the randomly chosen parameter in every iteration for building trees. If it is 0.7 then it means 70% of the parameter would be used.\n\n**Bagging_fraction**: It checks for the data fraction that will be used in every iteration. Often, used to increase the training speed and avoid overfitting.\n\n**Early_stopping_round**: If the metric of the validation data does show any improvement in last early_stopping_round rounds. It will lower the imprudent iterations.\n\n**Lambda**: It states regularization. Its values range from 0 to 1.\n\n**Min_gain_to_split**: Used to control the number of splits in the tree.\n\n### Core Parameters\n\n**Task**: It tells about the task that is to be performed on the data. It can either train on the data or prediction on the data.\n\n**Application**: This parameter specifies whether to do regression or classification. LightGBM default parameter for application is regression.\n\n**Binary**: It is used for binary classification.\n\n**Multiclass**: It is used for multiclass classification problems.\n\n**Regression**: It is used for doing regression.\n\n**Boosting**: It specifies the algorithm type.\n\n**rf** :  Used for Random Forest.\n\n**Goss**: Gradient-based One Side Sampling.\n\n**Num_boost_round**: It tells about the boosting iterations.\n\n**Learning_rate**: The role of learning rate is to power the magnitude of the changes in the approximate that gets updated from each tree’s output. It determines the contribution of each tree on the final outcome and controls how quickly the algorithm proceeds down the gradient descent (learns); Typical values between 0.001–0.3. Smaller values make the model robust to the specific characteristics of each individual tree, thus allowing it to generalize well. Smaller values also make it easier to stop prior to overfitting; however, they increase the risk of not reaching the optimum with a fixed number of trees and are more computationally demanding. This hyperparameter is also called shrinkage. Generally, the smaller this value, the more accurate the model can be but also will require more trees in the sequence.\n\n**Num_leaves**: It gives the total number of leaves that would be present in a full tree, default value: 31\n\n### Metric Parameter\n\nIt takes care of the loss while building the model. Some of them are stated below for classification as well as regression.\n\n**Mae**: Mean absolute error.\n\n**Mse**: Mean squared error.\n\n**Binary_logloss**: Binary Classification loss.\n\n**Multi_logloss**: Multi Classification loss.","metadata":{"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def light_gbm_model_run(train_x, train_y, validation_x, validation_y, test_x):\n    params = {\n        \"objective\" : \"regression\",\n        \"metric\" : \"rmse\",\n        \"num_leaves\" : 100,\n        \"learning_rate\" : 0.001,\n        \"bagging_fraction\" : 0.6,\n        \"feature_fraction\" : 0.6,\n        \"bagging_frequency\" : 6,\n        \"bagging_seed\" : 42,\n        \"verbosity\" : -1,\n        \"seed\": 42\n    }\n    # Given its a regression case, I am using the RMSE as the metric.\n\n    lg_train = lgb.Dataset(train_x, label=train_y)\n    lg_validation = lgb.Dataset(validation_x, label=validation_y)\n    evals_result_lgbm = {}\n\n    model_light_gbm = lgb.train(params, lg_train, 5000,\n                      valid_sets=[lg_train, lg_validation],\n                      early_stopping_rounds=100,\n                      verbose_eval=150,\n                      evals_result=evals_result_lgbm )\n\n    pred_test_light_gbm = np.expm1(model_light_gbm.predict(test_x, num_iteration=model_light_gbm.best_iteration ))\n\n    return pred_test_light_gbm, model_light_gbm, evals_result_lgbm","metadata":{"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"collapsed":false,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-19T10:24:16.933115Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-19T10:24:16.933622Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-19T10:24:16.94328Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-19T10:24:16.933582Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-19T10:24:16.942438Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Training and output of LightGBM Model\npredictions_test_y_light_gbm, model_lgbm, evals_result = light_gbm_model_run(X_train_split, y_train_split, X_validation, y_validation, X_test_original)\nprint('Output of LightGBM Model training..')","metadata":{"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"collapsed":false,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-19T10:24:16.944751Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-19T10:24:16.945099Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-19T10:32:28.901152Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-19T10:24:16.945062Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-19T10:32:28.900303Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n## Hyper-Parameter Tuning in LightGBM\n\nParameter Tuning is an important part that is usually done by data scientists to achieve a good accuracy, fast result and to deal with overfitting. Let us see quickly some of the parameter tuning you can do for better results.\n\n**num_leaves**: This parameter is responsible for the complexity of the model. I normally start by trying values in the range [10,100]. But if you have a solid heuristic to choose tree depth you can always use it and set num_leaves to 2^tree_depth - 1\n\n[LightGBM Documentation](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Parameters-Tuning.html) says in respect -\nThis is the main parameter to control the complexity of the tree model. Theoretically, we can set num_leaves = 2^(max_depth) to obtain the same number of leaves as depth-wise tree. However, this simple conversion is not good in practice. The reason is that a leaf-wise tree is typically much deeper than a depth-wise tree for a fixed number of leaves. Unconstrained depth can induce over-fitting. Thus, when trying to tune the num_leaves, we should let it be smaller than 2^(max_depth). For example, when the max_depth=7 the depth-wise tree can get good accuracy, but setting num_leaves to 127 may cause over-fitting, and setting it to 70 or 80 may get better accuracy than depth-wise.\n\n**Min_data_in_leaf**: Assigning bigger value to this parameter can result in underfitting of the model. Giving it a value of 100 or 1000 is sufficient for a large dataset.\n\n**Max_depth**: Controls the depth of the individual trees. Typical values range from a depth of 3–8 but it is not uncommon to see a tree depth of 1. Smaller depth trees are computationally efficient (but require more trees); however, higher depth trees allow the algorithm to capture unique interactions but also increase the risk of over-fitting. Larger training data sets are more tolerable to deeper trees.\n\n**num_iterations**: Num_iterations specifies the number of boosting iterations (trees to build). The more trees you build the more accurate your model can be at the cost of:\n    - Longer training time\n    - Higher chance of over-fitting\nSo typically start with a lower number of trees to build a baseline and increase it later when you want to squeeze the last % out of your model.\n\nIt is recommended to use smaller `learning_rate` with larger `num_iterations`. Also, we should use `early_stopping_rounds` if we go for higher `num_iterations` to stop your training when it is not learning anything useful.\n\n**early_stopping_rounds** - \"early stopping\" refers to stopping the training process if the model's performance on a given validation set does not improve for several consecutive iterations. This parameter will stop training if the validation metric is not improving after the last early stopping round. It should be defined in pair with a number of iterations. If we set it too large we increase the chance of over-fitting. **The rule of thumb is to have it at 10% of your `num_iterations`**.\n\n\n#### So for my above implementation of LightGBM, initially for two of the LightGBM parameters as below got me a score of 1.47953 (in Kaggle Public Board)\n\n```\n\"num_leaves\" : 40,\n\"learning_rate\" : 0.004,\n```\n\nAnd now if I only tune these parameters as below\n\n```\n\"num_leaves\" : 100,\n\"learning_rate\" : 0.001,\n```\n#### I got my score very very slightly updated to 1.4714 (in Kaggle Public Board)\n\nI also tried the below one (keeping 'num_leaves' at 70 to avoid over-fitting)\n\n```\n\"num_leaves\" : 70,\n\"learning_rate\" : 0.001,\n```\nWith this - I got a score of 1.47234 (in Kaggle Public Board)\n\n## Features Importance in LightGBM","metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"gain_light_gbm = model_lgbm.feature_importance('gain')\nfeature_imp_light_gbm = pd.DataFrame({'feature': model_lgbm.feature_name(),\n                                      'split': model_lgbm.feature_importance('split'),\n                                      'gain': 100 * gain_light_gbm / gain_light_gbm.sum()\n}).sort_values('gain', ascending=False)\nprint(feature_imp_light_gbm[:50])","metadata":{"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"collapsed":false,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-19T10:32:28.902713Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-19T10:32:28.90312Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-19T10:32:28.937967Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-19T10:32:28.903082Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-19T10:32:28.937276Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## XGBoost Model Training\n\n### Note on XGBoost\n\nBelow we will be using **XGBoost** which is an advanced version of Gradient boosting method, it literally means eXtreme Gradient Boosting. XGBoost dominates structured or tabular datasets on classification and regression predictive modeling problems. The XGBoost library implements the [gradient boosting decision tree algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting).\n\nDifferent from the traditional gradient descent technique, gradient enhancement helps to predict the optimal gradient of the additional model. This technique can reduce the output error at each iteration.\n\nIn practice what we do in order to build the learner is to:\n\n- Start with single root (contains all the training examples)\n\n- Iterate over all features and values per feature, and evaluate each possible split loss reduction:\n\n- gain = loss(father instances) - (loss(left branch)+loss(right branch))\n\n- The gain for the best split must be positive (and > min_split_gain parameter), otherwise we must stop growing the branch.\n\n**Leaf growth**\n\nXGboost splits up to the specified max_depth hyperparameter and then starts pruning the tree backwards and removes splits beyond which there is no positive gain. It uses this approach since sometimes a split of no loss reduction may be followed by a split with loss reduction. XGBoost can also perform leaf-wise tree growth (as LightGBM).\n\nNormally it is impossible to enumerate all the possible tree structures q. A greedy algorithm that starts from a single leaf and iteratively adds branches to the tree is used instead. Assume that I_L and I_R are the instance sets of left and right nodes after the split. Then the loss reduction after the split is given by,\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jzyLh81.png)\n\n## Differences in LightGBM & XGBoost\n\nLightGBM uses a novel technique of Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) to filter out the data instances for finding a split value while XGBoost uses pre-sorted algorithm & Histogram-based algorithm for computing the best split. Here instances mean observations/samples.\n\nLet's see how pre-sorting splitting works-\n\n- For each node, enumerate over all features\n\n- For each feature, sort the instances by feature value\n\n- Use a linear scan to decide the best split along that feature basis information gain\n\n- Take the best split solution along all the features\n\nIn simple terms, Histogram-based algorithm splits all the data points for a feature into discrete bins and uses these bins to find the split value of histogram. While, it is efficient than pre-sorted algorithm in training speed which enumerates all possible split points on the pre-sorted feature values, it is still behind GOSS in terms of speed.\n\n## XGBoost Model Parameters\n\nI am explaining only those Parameters that I will be implementing below in my function. For an exhaustive explanation of all of them [see here](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/03/complete-guide-parameter-tuning-xgboost-with-codes-python/)\n\n**objective [default=reg:linear]**\n\nThis defines the loss function to be minimized. Mostly used values are:\n\n- binary:logistic –logistic regression for binary classification, returns predicted probability (not class)\n\n- multi:softmax –multiclass classification using the softmax objective, returns predicted class (not probabilities)\nyou also need to set an additional num_class (number of classes) parameter defining the number of unique classes\n\n- multi:softprob –same as softmax, but returns predicted probability of each data point belonging to each class.\n\n**eval_metric [ default according to objective ]**\n\nThe metric to be used for validation data. The default values are rmse for regression and error for classification.\nTypical values are:\n\n- rmse – root mean square error\n\n- mae – mean absolute error\n\n- logloss – negative log-likelihood\n\n- error – Binary classification error rate (0.5 threshold)\n\n- merror – Multiclass classification error rate\n\n- mlogloss – Multiclass logloss\n\n- auc: Area under the curve\n\n\n**eta [default=0.3]**\n\n- Analogous to learning rate in GBM.\n- Makes the model more robust by shrinking the weights on each step.\n- Typical final values to be used: 0.01-0.2\n\n**colsample_bytree**:  We can create a random sample of the features (or columns) to use prior to creating each decision tree in the boosted model. That is, tuning Column Sub-sampling in XGBoost By Tree. This is controlled by the colsample_bytree parameter. The default value is 1.0 meaning that all columns are used in each decision tree. A fraction (e.g. 0.6) means a fraction of columns to be subsampled. We can evaluate values for colsample_bytree between 0.1 and 1.0 incrementing by 0.1.\n\n#### A Note on regularization in XGBoost\n\nXGBoost adds built-in regularization to achieve accuracy gains beyond gradient boosting. Regularization is the process of adding information to reduce variance and prevent overfitting.\n\nAlthough data may be regularized through hyperparameter fine-tuning, regularized algorithms may also be attempted. For example, Ridge and Lasso are regularized machine learning alternatives to LinearRegression.\n\nXGBoost includes regularization as part of the learning objective, as contrasted with gradient boosting and random forests. The regularized parameters penalize complexity and smooth out the final weights to prevent overfitting. XGBoost is a regularized version of gradient boosting.\n\nMathematically, XGBoost's learning objective may be defined as follows:\n\n### obj(θ) = l(θ) + Ω (θ)\n\nHere, **l(θ)**  is the loss function, which is the Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression, or the log loss for classification, and **Ω (θ)** is the regularization function, a penalty term to prevent over-fitting. Including a regularization term as part of the objective function distinguishes XGBoost from most tree ensembles.\n\nThe learning objective for the th boosted tree can now be rewritten as follows:\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/IRNCrvM.png)\n\n**reg_alpha and reg_lambda** : First note the loss function is defined as\n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/aw1Hod9.png)\n\n##### So the above is how the regularized objective function looks like if you want to allow for the inclusion of a L1 and a L2 parameter in the same model\n\n`reg_alpha` and `reg_lambda` control the L1 and L2 regularization terms, which in this case limit how extreme the weights at the leaves can become. Higher values of alpha mean more L1 regularization. See the documentation [here](http://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest///parameter.html#parameters-for-tree-booster).\n\nSince L1 regularization in GBDTs is applied to leaf scores rather than directly to features as in logistic regression, it actually serves to reduce the depth of trees. This in turn will tend to reduce the impact of less-predictive features. We might think of L1 regularization as more aggressive against less-predictive features than L2 regularization.\n\nThese two regularization terms have different effects on the weights; L2 regularization (controlled by the lambda term) encourages the weights to be small, whereas L1 regularization (controlled by the alpha term) encourages sparsity — so it encourages weights to go to 0. This is helpful in models such as logistic regression, where you want some feature selection, but in decision trees we’ve already selected our features, so zeroing their weights isn’t super helpful. For this reason, I found setting a high lambda value and a low (or 0) alpha value to be the most effective when regularizing.\n\n##### [From this Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.02754.pdf)\n\nYou find the mathematical underpinnings for XGBoost model by Tianqi Chen et al.

For classification, you can use **“CatBoostClassifier”** and for regression, **“CatBoostRegressor“**.\n\n**[Yandex](https://yandex.com/)** is relying heavily on Catboost for ranking, forecasting and recommendations. This model is serving more than 70 million users each month.\n\n\"CatBoost is an algorithm for gradient boosting on decision trees. Developed by Yandex researchers and engineers, it is the successor of the MatrixNet algorithm that is widely used within the company for ranking tasks, forecasting and making recommendations. It is universal and can be applied across a wide range of areas and to a variety of problems.\"\n\nOverall some of the algorithmic enhancements that **Catboost** brought:\n\n- 1. For data with **categorical** features the accuracy of CatBoost would be better compared to other algorithms.\n\n2. **Better over-fitting handling**: - CatBoost uses the implementation of ordered boosting, an alternative to the classic boosting algorithm, which will be specially significant on small datasets\n\n3. **GPU-training**: - The versions of CatBoost available from pip install (pip install catboost) and conda install (conda install catboost) have GPU support out-of-the-box. You just need to specify that you want to train your model on GPU in the corresponding HP (will be shown below).\n\nFor [GPU system requirements of CatBoost](https://catboost.ai/docs/concepts/python-installation.html#gpu-system-requirements)\n\nThe versions of CatBoost available from pip install and conda install have GPU support out-of-the-box.\nDevices with compute capability 3.0 and higher are supported in compiled packages.\nTraining on GPU requires NVIDIA Driver of version 418.xx or higher.\nThe Python version of CatBoost for CUDA of compute capability 2.0 can be built from source.\n\nTo check Compute Capability of your CUDA-GPU check this [NVIDIA Official Link](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus#compute)\n\nFurther for [Training on GPU](https://catboost.ai/docs/features/training-on-gpu.html)\n\nThe parameters that enable and customize training on GPU are set in the constructors of the classes - CatBoost (fit), CatBoostClassifier (fit), CatBoostRegressor (fit).\n`task_type` - The processing unit type to use for training. Possible values are - \"CPU\" or \"GPU\" . An example below\n\n```python\nmodel = CatBoostClassifier(iterations=1000,\n                           task_type=\"GPU\",\n                           devices='0:1')\nmodel.fit(train_data,\n          train_labels,\n          verbose=False)\n```\n\n**Categorical features handling in CatBoost Algorithm**\n\n[The below is taken from this paper](http://learningsys.org/nips17/assets/papers/paper_11.pdf)\n\nCategorical features have a discrete set of values called categories which are not necessary comparable with each other; thus, such features cannot be used in binary decision trees directly. A common practice for dealing with categorical features is converting them to numbers at the preprocessing time, i.e., each category for each example is substituted with one or several numerical values. The most widely used technique which is usually applied to low-cardinality categorical features is one-hot encoding: the original feature is removed and a new binary variable is added for each category [14]. One-hot encoding can be done during the preprocessing phase or during training, the latter can be implemented more efficiently in terms of training time and is implemented in CatBoost.\n\nFor further details on this red [CatBoost's documentation](https://catboost.ai/docs/concepts/algorithm-main-stages_cat-to-numberic.html)\n\n**Leaf growth algorithm in CatBoost**\n\nCatboost grows a balanced tree. In each level of such a tree, the feature-split pair that brings to the lowest loss (according to a penalty function) is selected and is used for all the level’s nodes. It is possible to change its policy using the grow-policy parameter.\n\n## CatBoost Training Parameters\n\nLet’s look at the common parameters in CatBoost:\n\n**loss_function** alias as **objective** — Metric used for training. These are regression metrics such as root mean squared error for regression and logloss for classification.\n\n**eval_metric** — Metric used for detecting over-fitting.\n\n**iterations** — The maximum number of trees to be built, defaults to 1000. It aliases are `num_boost_round`, `n_estimators`, and `num_trees`.\nSome notes on **Total num of Trees** - In **bagging** and **random forests**  the averaging of independently grown trees makes it very difficult to overfit with too many trees. However, in GBMs this function differently as each tree is grown in sequence to fix up the past tree’s mistakes. For example, in regression, GBMs will chase residuals as long as we allow them to. Also, depending on the values of the other hyperparameters, GBMs often require many trees (sometimes many thousands of trees). But also more trees, can easily overfit we must find the optimal number of trees that minimize the loss function of interest with cross validation.\n\n**learning_rate** alias **eta** — The learning rate that determines how fast or slow the model will learn. The default is usually varies between 0.01 to 0.03.\n\n**random_seed** alias **random_state** — The random seed used for training.\n\n**l2_leaf_reg** alias **reg_lambda** — Coefficient at the L2 regularization term of the cost function. The default is 3.0.\n\n**bootstrap_type** — Determines the sampling method for the weights of the objects, e.g Bayesian, Bernoulli, MVS, and Poisson.\ndepth —The depth of the tree.\n\n**grow_policy** — Determines how the greedy search algorithm will be applied. It can be either SymmetricTree, Depthwise, or Lossguide.\n\n**SymmetricTree** is the default. In SymmetricTree, the tree is built level-by-level until the depth is attained. In every step, leaves from the previous tree are split with the same condition. When **Depthwise** is chosen, a tree is built step-by-step until the specified depth is achieved. On each step, all non-terminal leaves from the last tree level are split. The leaves are split using the condition that leads to the best loss improvement. In **Lossguide**, the tree is built leaf-by-leaf until the specified number of leaves is attained. On each step, the non-terminal leaf with the best loss improvement is split\n\n**min_data_in_leaf** alias **min_child_samples** — This is the minimum number of training samples in a leaf. This parameter is only used with the Lossguide and Depthwise growing policies.\n\n**max_leaves** alias num_leaves — This parameter is used only with the Lossguide policy and determines the number of leaves in the tree.\n\n**ignored_features** — Indicates the features that should be ignored in the training process.\n\n**nan_mode** — The method for dealing with missing values. The options are Forbidden, Min, and Max. The default is Min. When Forbidden is used, the presence of missing values leads to errors. With Min, the missing values are taken as the minimum values for that feature. In Max, the missing values are treated as the maximum value for the feature.\n\n**leaf_estimation_method** — The method used to calculate values in leaves. In classification, 10 Newton iterations are used. Regression problems using quantile or MAE loss use one Exact iteration. Multi classification uses one Netwon iteration.\n\n**leaf_estimation_backtracking** — The type of backtracking to be used during gradient descent. The default is `AnyImprovement`. `AnyImprovement` decreases the descent step, up to where the loss function value is smaller than it was in the last iteration. Armijo reduces the descent step until the Armijo condition is met.\n\n**boosting_type** — The boosting scheme. It can be plain for the classic gradient boosting scheme, or ordered, which offers better quality on smaller datasets.\n\n**score_function** — The score type used to select the next split during tree construction. `Cosine` is the default option. The other available options are `L2`, `NewtonL2`, and `NewtonCosine`.\n\n**early_stopping_rounds** — When True, sets the over-fitting detector type to `Iter` and stops the training when the optimal metric is achieved.\n\nclasses_count — The number of classes for multi-classification problems.\ntask_type — Whether you are using a CPU or GPU. CPU is the default.\ndevices — The IDs of the GPU devices to be used for training.\ncat_features — The array with the categorical columns.\ntext_features —Used to declare text columns in classification problems.","metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Now Catboost model training\n\nmodel_catboost = CatBoostRegressor(iterations=500,\n                                   learning_rate=0.01,\n                                   depth=10,\n                                   eval_metric='RMSE',\n                                   random_seed = 42,\n                                   bagging_temperature=0.2,\n                                   od_type='Iter',\n                                   metric_period=50,\n                                   od_wait=20\n                                   )\n\nmodel_catboost.fit(X_train_split, y_train_split,\n                   eval_set=(X_validation, y_validation),\n                   use_best_model=True,\n                   verbose=50\n                   )\n\npredictions_test_y_catboost = np.expm1(model_catboost.predict(X_test_original))\n","metadata":{"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"collapsed":false,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-19T10:32:39.474818Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-19T10:32:39.475429Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-19T10:59:31.478608Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-19T10:32:39.475387Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-19T10:59:31.477796Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Creating DataFrame for Final Submission","metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\nsub = pd.read_csv('../input/santander-value-prediction-challenge/sample_submission.csv')\n\nsubmission_lgb = pd.DataFrame()\nsubmission_lgb['target'] = predictions_test_y_light_gbm\n\nsub['target'] = submission_lgb['target']","metadata":{"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"collapsed":false,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-19T10:59:31.480078Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-19T10:59:31.480442Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-19T10:59:31.544662Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-19T10:59:31.480405Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-19T10:59:31.543975Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Creating Output file for Submission","metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"submission_final = pd.read_csv('../input/santander-value-prediction-challenge/sample_submission.csv')\n\nsubmission_lgb = pd.DataFrame()\nsubmission_lgb['target'] = predictions_test_y_light_gbm\n\n# sub['target'] = submission_lgb['target']\n\nsubmission_xgb = pd.DataFrame()\nsubmission_xgb['target'] = predictions_test_y_xgb\n\nsubmission_catboost = pd.DataFrame()\nsubmission_catboost['target'] = predictions_test_y_catboost\n\nsubmission_final['target'] = (submission_lgb['target'] * 0.5 + submission_xgb['target'] * 0.3 + submission_catboost['target'] * 0.2)","metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-19T10:59:31.54704Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-19T10:59:31.547547Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-19T10:59:31.598646Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-19T10:59:31.547509Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-19T10:59:31.597998Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"submission_final.head()","metadata":{"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":false},"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"collapsed":false,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-19T10:59:31.599725Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-19T10:59:31.600047Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-19T10:59:31.609633Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-19T10:59:31.600009Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-19T10:59:31.60877Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"submission_final.to_csv('submission_combined_lgb_xgb_catboost.csv', index=False)\n","metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%%\n"},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-19T10:59:31.610997Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-19T10:59:31.611591Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-19T10:59:32.017674Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-19T10:59:31.611551Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-19T10:59:32.016859Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Further Reading and References\n\n- T.

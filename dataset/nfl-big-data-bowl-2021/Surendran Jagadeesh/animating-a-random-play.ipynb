Although the result looks like a tv video game from the 90's, I'm quite happy that I was able to replicate the animation from the [tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/tombliss/tutorial) written in R.\n\nAfter reading many articles, I found this [blog](https://brushingupscience.com/2016/06/21/matplotlib-animations-the-easy-way/) to be the best material to understand matplotlib animations. Similar steps from the blog has been followed here:\n- Choose a random game and play from that game.\n- Create a scatter plot with jersey numbers.\n- Animate the plot with FuncAnimation method with new xy position offsets from consecutive frame ids.\n\nI will be using a random football image as plot background."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Imports and reading data"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.image as mpimg\nfrom matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plays = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/plays.csv')\nweek_1 = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week1.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Football field image for plot background"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"football_field = mpimg.imread('../input/nfl2021/images/football_field.jpg')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Choosing a random game and play\nThe main idea here is to choose a random game and play from week1 tracking data and filter down to frameId 1.

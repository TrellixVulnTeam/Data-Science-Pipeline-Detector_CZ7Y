On pass plays, it's the defender's goal to prevent pass catchers from catching the ball in any way that doesn't draw a flag. In zone, defenders are covering a designated area of the field while watching the Quarterback. On the other hand, in Man-to-Man coverage, the defender is tracking a receiver step for step. \n\nWith both coverages, defenders must rely on speed, agility, and quick reflexes to prevent the receiver from catching the ball. Once the Quarterback throws the ball in a receiver's direction,  a close defender has the option to either play the man or to go after the ball for a pass deflection or an interception. We will show which players cover the most ground while the ball is in the air, resulting in either an incompletion or interception. \n\n","attachments":{}},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport glob","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"- We use all weeks except for Week 2 due to anomolies in the data."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Players & Play DataFrames\nplays = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/plays.csv')\nplayers = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/players.csv')\n#Adjust regex accordingly for certain weeks\nfilenames = glob.glob('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/*[1|3-9].csv')\n\ndfs = []\nfor filename in filenames:\n    dfs.append(pd.read_csv(filename))\n\n#Tracking Data excluding week 2\nweek = pd.concat(dfs, ignore_index=True)\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **1.0 Preprocessing**\n\n- For all pass plays the play description indicates the intended receiver.

The epa rank is the team with the lowest epa sum.  In other words, the team allowing the fewest expected points against the pass.  The sack rank is the team with the most sacks and the interception rank is the team with the most interceptions.  \n\nAfter ranking each team on each of the four criteria, the rankings are totaled to arrive at the final ranking of all teams.  The best passing defense in the NFL in 2018 is the **Chicago Bears** defense which ranked 2nd in completions, 1st in epa, tied for 3rd in sacks and was 1st in interceptions.

The completion rank is the player with the lowest completion percentage on pass attempts (minimum of 10 pass attempts).  In other words, the player allowing the fewest completions when a pass is thrown to the receiver he is defending.  The epa rank is the player with the lowest epa sum.  In other words, the player with the lowest expected points on defended pass plays.  The interception rank is the player with the most interceptions.  \n\nThere are many criteria on which a player can be judged, but these three encapsulate the key results for a pass defender – completions, points and interceptions.  Other criteria such as closing speed and the distance between receiver and defender were analyzed (see later discussion), but ultimately it’s the results that count. \n\nAfter ranking each player on the three criteria, the rankings are totaled to arrive at the final ranking of all 2018 defensive pass players.  The top three defensive passing players are:  **Damontae Kazee** on the Atlanta Falcons, **Eddie Jackson** on the Chicago Bears and **Xavien Howard** on the Miami Dolphins.

The player’s coverage ability was determined by calculating the average proximity of the defender to the receiver at the start of a pass and at the end of a pass.  A lower average would indicate the defender closely tracked the receiver.  The closing speed was determined by calculating the speed the defender approaches the receiver from the start of a pass to the end of a pass.  A higher closing speed indicates a faster close on the defender. \n\nThere appears to be an inverse relationship between closing speed and coverage ability.  If a defender is closely following a receiver his speed of convergence on the receiver will be tend to be slower than if he is farther away and accelerating to the receiver.\n\nNo players appear in both the top ten of closing speed and the top ten of coverage ability.  **When looking at the top ten players, they do tend to rank in the top 10% of the closing speed players.**  Interestingly, the top ten players do not rank particularly high in coverage ability or distance from the receiver at the point of reception (EndRank)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Table 4 - Top Defensive Pass Players by Coverage Ability and Speed"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"| Top Ten Speed Players    | SpeedRank | CoverRank | NumPlays | EndDist | AvgDist | AvgSpeed | EndRank |\n|--------------------------|-----------|-----------|----------|---------|---------|----------|---------|\n| Rontez Miles             | 1         | 500       | 10       | 6.40    | 16.59   | 4.0148   | 476     |\n| Blake Countess           | 2         | 475       | 12       | 5.09    | 12.98   | 3.2129   | 377     |\n| Adrian Colbert           | 3         | 481       | 27       | 5.27    | 13.30   | 3.1995   | 397     |\n| Tedric Thompson          | 4         | 484       | 65       | 5.17    | 13.49   | 3.1393   | 383     |\n| Doug Middleton           | 5         | 489       | 26       | 5.10    | 13.78   | 3.0397   | 378     |\n| Deon Bush                | 6         | 317       | 33       | 3.77    | 9.92    | 2.7865   | 157     |\n| Jahleel Addae            | 7         | 483       | 99       | 5.52    | 13.49   | 2.7839   | 420     |\n| Duron Harmon             | 8         | 413       | 65       | 4.28    | 11.28   | 2.6461   | 250     |\n| Sean Davis               | 9         | 450       | 109      | 4.93    | 12.20   | 2.6137   | 352     |\n| Mike Mitchell            | 10        | 499       | 48       | 6.74    | 15.68   | 2.6064   | 486     |\n|                          |           |           |          |         |         |          |         |\n| **Top Ten Coverage Players** | **CoverRank** | **SpeedRank** | **NumPlays** | **EndDist** | **AvgDist** | **AvgSpeed** | **EndRank** |\n| Quenton Meeks            | 1         | 398       | 19       | 2.42    | 4.78    | 0.1026   | 4       |\n| Nat Berhe                | 2         | 389       | 15       | 2.31    | 4.85    | 0.1381   | 2       |\n| DeShawn Shead            | 3         | 352       | 111      | 2.35    | 5.07    | 0.2447   | 3       |\n| Davon House              | 4         | 453       | 12       | 2.63    | 5.10    | -0.3172  | 8       |\n| Isaac Yiadom             | 5         | 300       | 110      | 2.42    | 5.12    | 0.3708   | 5       |\n| Jamal Agnew              | 6         | 441       | 41       | 2.74    | 5.18    | -0.1401  | 10      |\n| Quinton Dunbar           | 7         | 210       | 141      | 2.51    | 5.47    | 0.6148   | 6       |\n| Josh Shaw                | 8         | 31        | 18       | 2.05    | 5.53    | 2.0265   | 1       |\n| Tremon Smith             | 9         | 170       | 25       | 2.56    | 5.69    | 0.7720   | 7       |\n| Brandon Wilson           | 10        | 435       | 24       | 2.86    | 5.70    | -0.0821  | 16      |\n|                          |           |           |          |         |         |          |         |\n| **Top Ten Players**          | **SpeedRank** | **CoverRank** | **NumPlays** | **EndDist** | **AvgDist** | **AvgSpeed** | **EndRank** |\n| Damontae Kazee           | 11        | 490       | 75       | 5.52    | 13.82   | 2.5820   | 419     |\n| Eddie Jackson            | 21        | 291       | 129      | 3.92    | 9.66    | 2.2624   | 186     |\n| Xavien Howard            | 279       | 131       | 280      | 3.67    | 7.61    | 0.4075   | 136     |\n| Kevin Byard              | 67        | 144       | 162      | 3.32    | 7.81    | 1.3564   | 82      |\n| Duron Harmon             | 8         | 413       | 65       | 4.28    | 11.28   | 2.6461   | 250     |\n| Reshad Jones             | 37        | 477       | 114      | 5.83    | 13.07   | 1.7717   | 447     |\n| Andre Hal                | 40        | 415       | 36       | 4.85    | 11.31   | 1.7074   | 336     |\n| Anthony Harris           | 41        | 318       | 64       | 4.14    | 9.93    | 1.6825   | 229     |\n| Matt Milano              | 239       | 391       | 185      | 5.29    | 10.92   | 0.5335   | 400     |\n| Denzel Ward              | 350       | 142       | 322      | 3.86    | 7.80    | 0.2487   | 178     |"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Defensive Pass Coverage"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Reading defensive schemes is an art!  Offensive coordinators and quarterbacks spend countless hours trying to determine the defensive scheme prior to the snap.  Therefore, defenses try to disguise their schemes and create endless hybrids and combinations making defensive scheme identification difficult.\n\nFor the purposes of this analysis the pass coverages were broken down into the following five schemes: \n\n1. Cover-0 – No deep defenders with man-to-man coverage\n2. Cover-1 – One deep defender with man-to-man coverage\n3. Cover-2 – Two deep defenders with man-to-man coverage\n4. Cover-3 – Two deep defenders with zone coverage (also called Cover-2 Zone)\n5. Cover-4 – Three or more deep defenders with zone coverage (also called Prevent)\n\nFor each play these schemes were determined by the depth of the defenders and the orientation of the cornerbacks.  Any defender 10 yards or greater from the line of scrimmage at the snap of the ball was considered a “deep” defender.  If both cornerbacks were oriented towards the receiver the scheme was considered man-to-man otherwise any cornerback oriented towards the quarterback indicated a zone scheme.\n\nOnce the coverages were determined, the plays were broken into down-yardage scenarios.  This provides a picture of which defensive coverage schemes are used the most in different scenarios and which defensive coverage schemes are the most successful in each of those scenarios.  Schemes were ranked by the lowest completion percentage, lowest epa and highest interception average to determine the best performing scheme in each scenario.\n\n**1st Down**\n\n1st and short yardage is a rare case (e.g. 1st and goal) and as you would expect Cover-0 is the universal defensive pass scheme.\n\n1st and 5-10 yards is the most common scenario in the NFL and 2018 NFL teams overwhelmingly chose Cover-3 as their defensive pass scheme even as Cover-4 and Cover-2 schemes rank higher.  This is likely due to the fact that while epa and interception stats are better for Cover-4 and Cover-2 schemes, both tend to give up more completions than Cover-3.  Teams appear to play it safe with Cover-3 as it ranks in the exact middle of all the rankings.  Still many teams do recognize the effectiveness of Cover-4 as it is the second most popular choice in this situation. \n\nIn a 1st and long scenario, Cover-3 is both the most popular choice and the highest ranked.\n\n**2nd Down**\n\nIn a 2nd and short scenario 2018 NFL teams used Cover-3 or Cover-4 the most while Cover-0 ranks as the best choice.  As this is a short yardage situation it is likely that a tight man-to-man coverage such as Cover-0 would provide the best results for a likely short pass.\n\nIn a 2nd and 5-10 yard scenario and a 2nd and long scenario, Cover-3 is once again used the most while a Cover-0 or Cover-1 performs the best. Man-to-man coverage once again comes out on top of the rankings. \n\n**3rd Down**\n\nIn a 3rd and short scenario, Cover-3 is also used the most with Cover-0 (man coverage) and Cover-4 (zone coverage) both ranking higher.  Cover-0 is clearly the best choice based on the rankings.\n\nIn a 3rd and 5-10 scenario, both Cover-3 and Cover-4 (zone defenses) are heavily used, but Cover-1 is ranked the highest.  \n\nIn a 3rd and long scenario, Cover-3 is both the most popular choice and the highest ranked.\n\n**4th Down**\n\n4th down scenarios have relatively few data points as many offenses choose to punt on 4th down.  In a 4th and short scenario Cover-3 and Cover-0 are often used.  Late in the game you would expect zone coverage such as Cover-3 to stop a big play and earlier in the game you would expect Cover-0 to stop a 1st down.  \n\n**Summary**\n\n**2018 NFL teams appear to overly rely on the Cover-3 scheme.  While Cover-3 ranks the highest in 1st and long and 3rd and long, Cover-0 and Cover-1 (man-to-man coverages) appear to be under-utilized by many teams.  In the most common scenario of 1st and 5-10, defenses should consider using Cover-4 (zone coverage) or Cover-2 (man-to-man coverage) defensive schemes.**\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Table 5 - Defensive Pass Coverages by Downs and Yardage"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"| Scenarios     |

Routes"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In order to determine how well defensive pass coverage works against different offensive pass routes, a ranking of the outcome of all intended pass targets by route was created.  The rankings are from the perspective of the offense.  For epa, the routes are ranked from the highest average epa to the lowest average epa.  For completions, the routes are ranked from the highest completion rate to the lowest.  For interceptions, the routes are ranked from the lowest interception rate to the highest.\n\nSorting the list by epa provides some interesting insights into the effectiveness of passing defenses against different routes.  In general, the shorter the pass route the lower the average epa and interception percent and the higher the completion percent.  **Passing defenses are highly effective against the screen pass with a negative average epa – offenses are actually losing yards on average on a screen play.  Passing defenses also do well on the angle (or slant) routes as the interception percent is relatively high for a shorter route. The biggest weakness in passing defenses is the wheel route.  The wheel route gives up the most points with the highest epa average while maintaining a completion percent in the middle of the rankings.**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Table 6 - Routes by Offensive Ranking"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"| Route  | Attps | Compl | Incomp | Ints | epaMean | ComplPct | intPct | epaRank | CompRank | intRank |\n|--------|-------|-------|--------|------|---------|----------|--------|---------|----------|---------|\n| WHEEL  | 89    | 71    | 16     | 2    | 1.1758  | 79.78%   | 2.25%  | 1       | 7        | 9       |\n| CORNER | 336   | 235   | 86     | 15   | 0.9440  | 69.94%   | 4.46%  | 2       | 10       | 11      |\n| POST   | 587   | 395   | 161    | 31   | 0.8579  | 67.29%   | 5.28%  | 3       | 11       | 12      |\n| GO     | 1252  | 766   | 436    | 50   | 0.7361  | 61.18%   | 3.99%  | 4       | 12       | 10      |\n| IN     | 793   | 618   | 164    | 11   | 0.5765  | 77.93%   | 1.39%  | 5       | 9        | 6       |\n| CROSS  | 1548  | 1259  | 269    | 20   | 0.4532  | 81.33%   | 1.29%  | 6       | 5        | 4       |\n| SLANT  | 914   | 718   | 183    | 13   | 0.3537  | 78.56%   | 1.42%  | 7       | 8        | 7       |\n| OUT    | 1913  | 1537  | 350    | 26   | 0.3216  | 80.35%   | 1.36%  | 8       | 6        | 5       |\n| HITCH  | 2032  | 1677  | 331    | 24   | 0.2743  | 82.53%   | 1.18%  | 9       | 4        | 3       |\n| ANGLE  | 523   | 453   | 61     | 9    | 0.0917  | 86.62%   | 1.72%  | 10      | 3        | 8       |\n| FLAT   | 1972  | 1712  | 246    | 14   | 0.0451  | 86.82%   | 0.71%  | 11      | 2        | 2       |\n| SCREEN | 1052  | 995   | 53     | 4    | -0.0123 | 94.58%   | 0.38%  | 12      | 1        | 1       |"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Defensive Pass Matchups"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Offenses will often attempt to design passing plays to create a coverage mismatch between the receiver and the defender.

The Bears, however, have an outside linebacker (Leonard Floyd) who perfoms more like a DB with a DB worthy completion rate of 62% compared to the average outside linebacker completion rate 71%.\n\n**Sacks**\n\nThe Bears rank 3rd in sacks, indicating a high level of pressure on the quarterback.\n\nPut all these factors together and you create a season leading pass defense!"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Appendix"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"All the code, data and associated files for this project can be found at my [GitHub](https://github.com/JimKing100/Kaggle-NFL) repo.

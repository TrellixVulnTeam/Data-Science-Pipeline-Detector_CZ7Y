Summary\n\nIn the analysis below, I propose new \"[Next Gen Stats](https://nextgenstats.nfl.com/glossary)\" for pass defense, and a framework for evaluating whether these are useful statistics. These innovative stats can help us better understand individual player skill in specific aspects of pass defense (i.e. Target Prevention, Coverage, Reaction, Disruption, Penalty Avoidance), as well the ability of a player to impact the performance of teammates (i.e. ISLAND, BOOST). These new stats are all measured \"over expectation,\" similar to [Completion Probability Over Expected (CPOE) or Rushing Yards Over Expected (RYOE)](https://www.nfl.com/news/next-gen-stats-intro-to-expected-rushing-yards). The statistics are based on how well a player performs relative to an \"expected value,\" which is calculated from machine learning models that are automatically trained to estimate the mean expectation of a given situation and outcome.\n\nOne novel difference from prior work is that the \"actual\" statistic values are expectations. For example, rather than comparing a player’s actual value (i.e. completion percentage, rush yards, interceptions) to an expected value (i.e. expected completion percentage, expected rush yards, expected interceptions), instead we measure a players expected value in a given situation (i.e. expected defensive success rate at pass arrival) to an expected value at a prior timestamp (i.e. expected defensive success rate at pass throw). This allows us to improve metric stability by considering performance across a larger sample of plays (i.e. even when not targeted) and does not over weight rare statistics that exist for defensive players (e.g. the NFL leader in interceptions only had 6 in 2019). Additionally, by only considering the expected play outcome (instead of actual play EPA), this allows us to focus on what we are trying to measure (i.e. pass coverage), but not be biased by events that are largely luck (i.e. missed tackles, fumbles, defensive touchdowns).\n\nThis analysis concluded that proposed statistics **Pass Coverage Success Rate Over Expectation (PCOE)**, **Target Coverage Success Rate Over Expectation (TCOE)**, and **Target Reaction Success Rate Over Expectation (TROE)** all show positive signs in terms of \"stickiness\" and correlation with Defensive EPA. With some additional fine-tuning we believe they can be useful additions to NFL Next Gen Stats."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2. Background\n\nStarting in 2015 the NFL [began embedding RFID tags in players shoulder pads](https://operations.nfl.com/the-game/technology/nfl-next-gen-stats/). This enabled the NFL to start capturing real-time data for every player on every play. This data has unlocked innovative [Next Gen Stats](https://nextgenstats.nfl.com/glossary) such as [Completion Probability Over Expected (CPOE) and Rushing Yards Over Expected (RYOE)](https://www.nfl.com/news/next-gen-stats-intro-to-expected-rushing-yards). Though metrics for analyzing quarterbacks, running backs, and wide receivers are consistently a part of public discourse, techniques for analyzing the defensive part of the game trail and lag behind. The goal of the [2021 NFL Big Data Bowl](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/overview) is to identify unique and impactful approaches to measure defensive performance on passing plays."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3.

Methodology\n\n### \"Over Expected\" Stats\n\nGiven the rising popularity of \"Over Expected\" stats in the NFL, my approach was to build on top of this proven technique. Such a method is powerful because it allows you to build cutting-edge machine learning models to best account for the complex player/team interactions that occur on the football field. The end result is statistics that are better able to control for context and situation when compared with traditional statistics. Even though the underlying process is sophisticated, the output is intuitive to understand (i.e. \"performed X better/worse than the average expectation in that situation\")."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Pass Defense Segments\n\nBefore proposing specific statistics, we must first define which segments of pass defense we do and don't want to measure.

Therefore, my approach was to shy away from metrics such as \"interceptions over expectation,\" as this would likely result in stability issues where players performance would vary greatly year to year. \n\nOne approach considered was to create metrics that intuitively correlate with pass coverage skill, such as \"lack of receiver separation over expectation.\" While likely informative, such metrics may not always correlate with actual success and risk over-emphasizing the wrong behavior. For example, there are situations where it is optimal to give a receiver separation.\n\nFor these reasons, we chose to focus on measuring a player’s impact on overall play success (i.e. \"Defensive-Success-Rate\").\n\n> **Defensive-Success-Rate (DSR)** - The rate at which plays are \"won\" by the defense.

Some of the models used all receiver routes, regardless of whether the receiver was targeted, whereas others were limited to targeted routes only (16,698).\n\nAll models were trained on a base set of features spanning situation, personnel, pass details, receiver route details, and receiver movement metrics.

Model Considerations\n* While overall EPA was considered, we chose DSR as the model target to (1) improve stability - success rate is less susceptible to bias from outlier plays<sub>2</sub> and (2) eliminate bias from post pass outcome events that cause large swings in EPA (e.g. broken tackle touchdown, fumble for defensive touchdown, etc.).\n* We chose to include sacks as a \"time of throw\" event in order to avoid throwing out data when no pass was attempted on the play as this is partially due to strong pass coverage.\n* Quarterback and receiver skill are not explicitly factored in by the models. This helps avoid challenges with out of sample prediction and/or small sample sizes. That being said, quarterback throw difficulty is considered based on \"pass details\" data and receiver coverage difficulty is explicitly factored in through \"receiver movement metrics\" (i.e. speed, acceleration, etc.). Below we will see that quarterback and receiver skill is \"averaged out\" when evaluating defensive players and limits exposure of specific offensive player skill from impacting defender player evaluation (i.e. defenders are compared against expected DSR in a given situation instead of actual EPA).\n* While the intent of not having defender features known by some of the models is to keep the model unbiased by defender player skill, it is worth noting that defenders can have some impact on receiver movement metrics (jamming at the line, slowing down, redirecting, etc.). This is something to be aware of and worth revisiting.\n\n<sup>2</sup> *I haven't confirmed success rate is more sticky season-to-season but [this post](https://www.footballperspective.com/rushing-epa-and-yards-per-carry/) suggests this is true for rushing EPA.*"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### A.5. Possible Extensions\n\nSome possible extensions of this work might include:\n* This analysis was only looking at one season worth of data (and only a sub-sample of the data for modeling). It would be interesting to see how looking across seasons might change results. Using a larger data sample might open up an opportunity to segment stats further (i.e. by Man vs. Zone coverage) to learn even more about players. \n* Given the robust AutoML framework used in this analysis there was no effort done to prune non-predictive features. It would be useful to explore trimming the feature set down into only the most predictive features. The feature set for each model should also be holistically re-evaluated, as certain features could in theory lead to leakage in terms of things that are/aren't in control of the player. For example, things like player orientation/ball speed can proxy for things like \"poorly thrown ball\" or \"decoy route\" which are out of control of the defender and could in theory make a statistic less sticky.\n* The decision to use “second closest defender\" to capture team effects is easy to implement but likely isn't optimal. Further research should be done to determine whether there exists a better heuristic (i.e. \"within X yards\"). Probing coaches and players for insight on this topic would likely be revealing.\n* Given the small sample sizes we could consider using [Empirical Bayes](https://tothemean.com/2020/09/06/empirical-bayes.html) to regress players to the mean and likely improve stability."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### A.6.

The reason to choose this attribute as the prediction class is that it has a very high impact in the game outcome. For this analysis i have chosen one team's defence against all other teams offence. The team i choose is \"philadelphia eagles\".To create a consensus i have created a classification model which includes the most important variables affecting the predictor variable \"passResult\".\n> \n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Features:\n> 1.

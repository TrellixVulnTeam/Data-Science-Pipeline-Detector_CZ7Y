And while I'm a beginner in terms of pandas/python, I knew I could bring some novel ideas because I'm a problem solver.\n\nMy approach to this analysis was to put on the hat of a GM in charge of personnel decisions, and to answer the question posed in the competition \"Who are the NFL's best players against the pass?\" I know that I don't understand the nuances of game and play data to put on the hat of a coach. So I'm looking a little more high level to see which players, over the course of a season, made an outsized impact. This will let the GM find deals for players that could have an impact. \n\nThe metric I'm going to narrow in on is \"Yards Gained\". For the sake of this analysis, I'm going to keep it fairly simple: Expected yards gained vs Actual yards gained \n\nThe other piece of philosophy on this analysis is the concept of everyone being equal on defense. Unlike baseball, where one player is measured by getting on base, NFL defense needs to either weight certain players a certain way, or treat everyone equal. Before getting to this decision, I ran a correlation analysis on the \"distance\" between players on the field and \"yards gained\". I found no correlation. Therefore, I'm going to assume, for the purpose of this analysis, that all defensive players are treated equal. And that's not a bad decision in my opinion. If a linemen is able to pressure the quarterback faster than anticipated, the QB has less time to respond on a passing play. If a cornerback or safety blocks a pass, forces a WR to get out of posision, or forces the QB to second guess a pass due to positioning, that all has an impact. Football is by far a team sport and a team effort.\n\nSo, with all that as context, here's the actual data that I'm going to process: \n1. Aggregate the simple average yards that QB's got on any given play and formation\n2. Get a distinct list of all defensive players that were on the field for the plays against those specific QB's. \n3. Calculate the \"expected yards\" on any given play given the QB and formation (the concept of \"expected yards\" in this instance is super simple, but I think the framework could be powerful and could be built on over time)\n4. For each defensive player, calculate the delta of expected vs actual \n5. Aggregate the average \"expected yards delta\" for any defensive player\n\nThis definitely won't be the most impressive \"visual\" analysis, but I'm hoping that the calculation (and associated csv file) is good for personnel choices. Also, I'm not sure what the \"standard\" is because this is my first kaggle competition, but I deleted MANY cells I used for dataframe.describe or series.value_counts because they were for my learning, but not necessarily relevant to the competition."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Pulling in all data into pandas dataframes\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndir \nallweeks = pd.concat(map(pd.read_csv, ['../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week1.csv', \n                                       '../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week2.csv',\n                                       '../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week3.csv',\n                                       '../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week4.csv',\n                                       '../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week5.csv',\n                                       '../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week6.csv',\n                                       '../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week7.csv',\n                                       '../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week8.csv',\n                                       '../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week9.csv',\n                                       '../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week10.csv',\n                                       '../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week11.csv',\n                                       '../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week12.csv',\n                                       '../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week13.csv',\n                                       '../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week14.csv',\n                                       '../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week15.csv',\n                                       '../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week16.csv',\n                                       '../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week17.csv']))\n\nplays = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/plays.csv')\n#players = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/players.csv') I realized later that I don't ever use this\ngames = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/games.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#then merging plays with games so I can get the defensive team within the plays data\nplays = pd.merge(plays,  \n                      games,  \n                      on ='gameId',  \n                      how ='inner') ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#adding column def_team to the plays dataframe\n\nplays[\"def_team\"] = np.where(plays[\"possessionTeam\"]==plays[\"homeTeamAbbr\"], plays[\"visitorTeamAbbr\"], plays[\"homeTeamAbbr\"])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#from allweeks data, removing all of the \"frame data\", removing columns I don't need, removing football, and removing duplicates\naw_col = ['gameId','playId','team','nflId','week','displayName','position']\naw = allweeks.reindex(columns=aw_col)\naw = aw.drop_duplicates()\naw = aw[aw['team'] != \"football\"] \n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#now that I have a more clean list of weekly play/player data, \n#I can merge with plays data to get offensive result\naw = pd.merge(aw,\n              plays,  \n              on =[\"gameId\",\"playId\"],  \n              how ='inner') ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#calculating whether the player's team is on offense or defense and then splitting the dataframe into two\n\naw[\"playerTeam\"] = np.where(aw[\"team\"]==\"home\",aw[\"homeTeamAbbr\"],aw[\"visitorTeamAbbr\"])\n\naw_def = aw[aw[\"playerTeam\"] == aw[\"def_team\"]]\naw_off = aw[aw[\"playerTeam\"] != aw[\"def_team\"]]\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#now limiting the offensive players to evaluate to just QB's. \n#The reason I'm doing this is mostly to avoid duplicates. \n#I toyed around with the idea with including WR and TE, but couldn't figure out the math\n#I also figure QB's have an outsized impact on passing plays \n\naw_off = aw_off[aw_off[\"position\"].isin(['QB'])]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As a reminder, at this point in the code, I have the data needed and structured to start making necessary calculations.

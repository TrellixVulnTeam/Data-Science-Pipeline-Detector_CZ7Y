I group elite defenses by ranking the metrics provided by the NFL based on passResult.\n\n\nI believe that player tracking data should be used in tandem with simple data in order to identify the relevant factors influencing which schemes develop across a given play or game.\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib\nmatplotlib.use(\"Agg\")\nimport plotly\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.patches as patches\npd.set_option('max_columns', 100)\n%matplotlib inline\nplt.style.use('seaborn-whitegrid')\n\n\n#Import Plays, Player, Week and GameData\ndf_games=pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/games.csv\")\ndf_players=pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/players.csv\")\ndf_plays=pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/plays.csv\")\ndf_week_1=pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week1.csv\")\ndf_week_2=pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week2.csv\")\ndf_week_3=pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week3.csv\")\ndf_week_4=pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week4.csv\")\ndf_week_5=pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week5.csv\")\ndf_week_6=pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week6.csv\")\ndf_week_7=pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week7.csv\")\ndf_week_8=pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week8.csv\")\ndf_week_9=pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week9.csv\")\ndf_week_10=pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week10.csv\")\ndf_week_11=pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week11.csv\")\ndf_week_12=pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week12.csv\")\ndf_week_13=pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week13.csv\")\ndf_week_14=pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week14.csv\")\ndf_week_15=pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week15.csv\")\ndf_week_16=pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week16.csv\")\ndf_week_17=pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week17.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First, we identify potential columns for out target/outcome variable based on the data they provide.

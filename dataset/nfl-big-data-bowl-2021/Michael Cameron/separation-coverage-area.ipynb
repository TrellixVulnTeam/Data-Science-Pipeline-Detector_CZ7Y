Using similar histograms, we can show that although a defender being in front of the receiver has a better chance of breaking up the pass, if the pass is completed then the play is likely to go for more yards than if he was positioned behind the receiver. It suggests the ball was thrown over the defender and the receiver is more likely to have space downfield to run into and gain yards.

To do this I developed a new metric, ‘Player Coverage Area’. It is calculated by drawing a circle around the defensive player which has a radius proportional to the distance they are from the ball. It represents an area that the defender could reach when the ball is thrown. This area will be larger the further downfield a defender is, and it will grow proportioinally with the square of the distance from the ball. It can also be visualised dynamically, as in the animation below.

"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"On a team level I was interested to find any patterns of the total area covered by a team’s defense, the ‘Total Coverage Area’ (TCA), the sum of each defensive player’s coverage area. To do this I used a grid sampling algorithm to ensure the area estimate did not double count the areas of any overlapping circles. The area was also bounded by the end of the endzone and the sidelines so that any area that was out of bounds was not included in the sum. I looked for any correlations of the TCA to yards gained, EPA or the current game state. No clear patterns emerged and the distribution of each team’s TCA were all very similar."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"TCA can be used as an alternative measure to show how defenses line up. Rather than just giving the positions of players, we can give a value of TCA. A larger TCA value signifies a deeper defense with more defenders covering deep passes, they are further from the quarterback. The differences in TCA when the offense is fielding varying numbers of wide receivers, and also the number of defensive backs lining up in the secondary are shown in the histograms below. There is a lot of overlap in TCA values for the number of wide receivers faced or defensive backs on the play. This is why I think TCA can be more useful for describing a defense. It gives a sense of how the players are positioned on the pitch in comparison to the quarter back, rather than just a list of positions on the play. TCA can be measured at any point during a play, but the examples below use the moment the ball was

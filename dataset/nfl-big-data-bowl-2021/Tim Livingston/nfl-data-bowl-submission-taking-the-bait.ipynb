Why does play action continue to work even as prevalence increases and defensive coaches work to clamp down on these plays? [FiveThirtyEight’s Josh Hermsmeyer](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-nfl-coaches-overuse-play-action-they-havent-yet/) posits that “when defenders bite on a play-action fake, they move out of position for defending the pass and create clear lanes for the QB to throw to the intermediate and deep parts of the field.”  Such a case can be seen below where Tom Brady draws Myles Jack out of position with a fake, hitting Jacob Hollister for a 9 yard gain.\n\n![figure1a](https://i.imgur.com/dBRKWn3.gif)\n![figure1b](https://i.imgur.com/R18QtTQ.gif)\n\nHermsmeyer backed this claim up by leveraging NFL player tracking data by analyzing the amount of distance middle linebackers travel while “biting” on play action. Comparing the amount of “wasted” movement by these players against how many instances play action had been used to that point in the game, Hermsmeyer shows that the degree of biting does not diminish with more instances of play action in the game - good news for PA-happy offenses.\n\nMore so than the number of play action plays in a game, there are other play level factors that might influence the degree to which linebackers bite on the play fake such as offensive formation, personnel groupings, or individual player attributes. To assess these situations we used the 2018 player tracking data made available by the NFL to develop our own calculation of LB wasted movement, compare against a “run expectation” measure, and understand the factors leading to LBs biting disproportionately to the game situation. These insights will be valuable for defensive coaches and players who, understanding the factors that lead them to react disproportionately to the play-action versus objective expectation of a run, can make corrections in order to defend these situations more appropriately in the future. \n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Methodology: Linebacker wasted movement calculation\n\nThe foundation of our analysis was determining the amount of “wasted movement” by linebackers towards the line of scrimmage on play-action pass plays. We limited our analysis to neutral game script plays. For the purpose of our analysis neutral game script was defined as follows: \n1. 1st, 2nd, or 3rd down, before the 2-minute warning in either half\n2. No penalties (except Defensive Pass Interference)\n3. No empty defensive box,  punts, or spikes \n4. nflfastR win probability between 20% and 80% \n5. Play result is not “No Play’\n \n\nOur calculation works by finding the point in time when, having moved forward expecting a run, linebackers recognize the play action fake and change direction away from the LOS. We look for this change in direction after the fake and before the pass is thrown.\n\nTo implement this methodology, we calculated the change in x-position for LBs for each play, thereby isolating movement relative to the LOS. We then searched for a frame when the x-velocity changed from positive to negative (or vice versa, depending on field orientation).\n\nWe added three filters to improve our calculation:\n1. Change in movement cannot occur until 3 frames after ball is snapped\n2. Change in x-velocity must be at least 0.04 in magnitude to filter out pauses or immaterial changes in movement (false positives)\n3. Change in movement to occur at most 1 yard behind the line of scrimage to filter for blitzers\n\nThe prior example illustrates our calculation. On this play, LB#44 (Myles Jack) bites fairly hard on the play fake and wastes a meaningful amount of movement.\n\nOur “distance clock” starts at the snap (see figure below). Lured by the run fake, Jack moves towards the LOS. Shortly after realizing the fake, but before the pass is thrown, Jack changes direction away from the LOS to drop into coverage. This is the key moment that our calculation detects.\n\n\n\n![figure2](https://i.imgur.com/jAJ2eem.png)\n\nAfter finding the frame in which Jack changes direction, we sum the distance travelled between the snap and frame 27 (4.59 yards). This is the “wasted” movement that must be recovered as Jack corrects to play the pass.\n\nA final note on two special cases. We consider an LB to be blitzing if they move more than 1 yard beyond the LOS prior to the pass being thrown. We discard all blitzers from calculations in this paper as we do not believe the concept of wasted movement applies to a linebacker with no pass responsibilities on the play.\n\nLastly, “perfect” coverage is the result of a linebacker never biting towards the LOS - thus, there is no change in direction backwards to detect. We include these cases as zero wasted movement values in the figures calculated in this paper.\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Analysis\n\n### Impact of Wasted Movement\n\nThe nflfastR database contains a variable “xpass” indicating the probability, based on all plays in that down, distance, time, and score situation, that the play will be a pass. The inverse indicates the expectation the play will be a run, and we used this “xrun” variable to assess the amount of LB wasted movement for situations with higher or lower run probabilities.\n\n![figure3](https://i.imgur.com/PWlay90.png)\n\nThe plot above demonstrates the relationship between our wasted distance calculation and nflfastR’s expected run calculation. Intuitively, the positive slope of the line of fit makes sense. When play action is used in high expected run scenarios, for example in third down and short yardage to gain scenarios, the linebackers are more likely to react to play action compared to a third down and long, a low expected run scenario. We also notice that second downs have the largest variability of expected run percent and associated wasted movement, and that play action on second down, even in low expected run situations, can produce similar amounts of wasted distance as a much higher expected run scenario. \n\nNext, we want to look at how this wasted distance being created by play action may be hurting the defense and affecting the outcome of plays.  \n\n\n![figure4](https://i.imgur.com/zVtRfqS.png)\n\nNflfastR, leveraging its completion probability model, provides a calculation for completion percentage over expected (CPOE) for certain pass plays. By plotting CPOE vs. wasted distance, we can see that as the wasted distance created by play action increases, the average CPOE increases. This result is quantifying how play action is able to achieve its goal of drawing linebackers away from coverage responsibilities or to creating space over the middle of the field to create better passing lanes for the quarterback.\n\n![figure5](https://i.imgur.com/RO1rftl.png)\n\nThe next figure shows that increases in wasted distance also result in a higher average expected points added, or a worse outcome for the defense. In first and second down situations, or scenarios where the defense is suspecting a run, the positive relationship between increases in wasted distance and average epa hold true and even improve. \n\n### Drivers of Wasted Movement\n\nNow that we know that increases in wasted distance produce better outcomes for the offense and worse outcomes for the defense, we can examine which offensive formations or running backs create the most wasted distance from opposing defenses or which linebackers are the best at ‘staying home’ and not biting on play action fakes.\n\nPlotting the linebacker wasted distance vs. xrun for all the neutral game script play action plays as in the “Wasted Movement vs. Expected Run” exhibit above, we can approximate a linear relationship between these two variables:\n\n\twasted_movement =  1.94 +2.01 * xrun\n\nThis relationship can be used to make a prediction of the amount of movement a LB should waste given run expectation in the situation, and we subtract this prediction from the actual wasted movement to calculate a wasted movement variance as follows:\n\n\tWasted movement var. = (wasted movement actual) - (wasted movement predicted)\n\nIn this case, a positive value indicates the LB wasted more movement than expected while negative indicates less wasted movement than expected. Looking across offensive formations and personnel (RB, LB) we identified particular drivers of wasted movement.\n\n\n#### Offensive Formations\n\nThree formations (I Formation, Shotgun, Singleback) represent 96% of the plays we examined. Excluding low N formations (wildcat, pistol, jumbo, etc) we see the following average variance on wasted movement vs. expectation:\n\n\n    I Formation: +0.50 yards vs. expectation based on xrun\n    Singleback: +0.32 yards vs. expectation based on xrun\n    Shotgun: -0.72 yards vs. expectation based on xrun\n\nThis indicates that for plays where the offense is in I Formation in particular, LBs are wasting more movement than would be expected based on the xrun value. Breaking I Formation plays by down, we see this over reaction is particularly stark on 2nd down plays. For these plays, even though xrun is consistently below 50%, LBs are biting to the same degree as on higher xrun first down plays:\n\n![figure6](https://i.imgur.com/TBfmtCG.png)\n\nBased on this result, a key coaching point should be that players should recognize but not overreact to the run tendency indicated by the offensive formation in situations where down and distance would render a run play unlikely.\n\n#### Individual Players\n\nAre there fearsome running backs who linebackers spy in the backfield and gear up especially for a run because of how hard those ball carriers are to take down? Are certain linebackers worse at staying home on play action and consistently wasting more movement than would be expected? We assessed the wasted movement variance for plays based on the RBs present in the offense to understand which offensive players affect greater (or lesser) reactions from the defense on play action than expected. Conversersely, we performed a similar analysis on LBs to understand which players pose a liability due to excess wasted movement in these situations. Both samples below are restricted to players with 20 or more observations.\n\n![figure7](https://i.imgur.com/r5ViQjt.jpg)\n\nOn the RB side, consistent with the finding that I Formation drives more wasted movement than expected based on xrun, full backs like Ricky Ortiz, Kyle Juszczyk, and James Develin show up as particular drivers of excess wasted movement. Additionally, noted bruiser Derrick Henry is the second highest performer indicating that LBs are respecting the threat when fakes involve players with this sort of reputation. On the other hand, prolific pass catching backs like James White, Kareem Hunt, and Christian McCaffrey all rank low in terms of excess wasted movement, indicating that LBs remain conservative when reacting to the fake respecting these players’ ability in the passing game. Again, the coaching implication is that LBs should not overreact to indications of run (in this case, the RB personnel) on plays with low xrun. \n\nOn the LB side, elite players like Von Miller, Dont’a Hightower, KJ Wright, and Luke Kuechly are highly ranked at the position in terms of wasting less movement than expected (Miller and Kuechly made the Pro Bowl in this 2018 season). At the other end of the list, there are some players who had more disappointing performances for their teams like Haason Reddick (ARZ declined 5th year option in May 2020) and Adarius Taylor (let go by TB following 2018 season, cut by CLE following 2019 season). While the list doesn’t entirely match expectations on the top linebackers in football with high performers toward the bottom and vice versa, the alignment with other player outcomes indicates that the ability to limit wasted movement on pass plays is a meaningful indicator of linebacker quality and performance.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Future Research\nOur analysis has established that more wasted movement leads to better outcomes for the offense and worse outcomes for the defense on play action plays. Additionally, we have shown that the degree of wasted movement by linebackers does not diminish as much as would be expected as the xrun value declines. Disproportionate wasted movement for the situation can be driven by factors like offensive formation and individual personnel on the offense (RB) or defense (LB). \n\nThese findings are relevant to defensive players and coaches seeking to understand and correct for irrational tendencies in these situations. Future efforts to investigate this topic will include fine tuning the wasted movement calculation to better capture the dynamics of all plays, more detailed examination on the impact of wasted movement on a range of play outcomes, and diving deeper into the offensive and defensive determinants of excess wasted movement (e.g., zone or man coverage).\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

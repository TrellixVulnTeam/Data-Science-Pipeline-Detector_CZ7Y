We looked for correlations between the predictor variables and the response variables\n\nBased on the information of plays' outcomes, our goal was to identify predictor and response variables and build a regression decision tree in order to find the ones that impacts offense play result the most. \n\nThe data is both quantative and categorical. That's why we need to convert all catergorical columns to numpy array with dummy variables and then combine them back with quantative categories.\n\nThen we fit the data in and build the decision tree. We then map feature importances to columns and create a dictionary with all the predictors and associated with them importances."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#load libraries\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt   #for plotting\nfrom sklearn import tree          #for decision trees\nfrom sklearn import preprocessing","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#read data\ngames = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/games.csv')\nplayers = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/players.csv')\nplays = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/plays.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Exploratory Data Analysis\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Games table"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"games.head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"games.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Players table"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"players.head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"players.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#clean height data\n#convert string into normal format and replace values\nreplacement_values = {'5-6':'66','5-7':'67','5-8':'68','5-10':'70','5-11':'71','5-9':'69',\n                      '6-0':'72','6-1':'73','6-2':'74',\n                      '6-3':'75','6-4':'76','6-5':'77','6-6':'78','6-7':'79'}\n\nplayers['height'].replace(to_replace=replacement_values,inplace=True)\nplayers['height'] = players['height'].astype('int32',copy=False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#position value counts and number of positions\nprint(\"Player position value counts: \",players['position'].value_counts(),sep='\\n')\nprint('\\n',\"Number of Positions: \",players['position'].unique().size,sep='')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"players['height'].hist()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The players's height is fairly normally distributed."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#note: order by number of players descending\nplayers['height'].hist(by=players['position'],figsize=(10,10))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"players['weight'].hist()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The players's weight is normally distributed with a heavy left-tail, meaning a lot of very heavy players."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#note: order by number of players descending\nplayers['weight'].hist(by=players['position'],figsize=(10,10))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Focus on defensive players.

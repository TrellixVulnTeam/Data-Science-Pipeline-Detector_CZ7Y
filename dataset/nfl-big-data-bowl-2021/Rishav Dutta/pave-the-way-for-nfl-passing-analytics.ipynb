How can we evaluate defensive coverage on all the valuable areas of the field?  We _tackle_ these questions by building the **Passing Value in Expectation ($PaVE$)** metric using the tracking data provided. \n\nAny casual football viewer knows that an incomplete pass doesn’t necessarily reflect immaculate defensive coverage, and passes can be completed despite multiple defenders draped over the receiver ([see Gronkowski, Rob](https://arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tbt.s3.amazonaws.com/public/NI5UXEMOHJCZBNBVQUBC6RDDIE.jpg)). Rather, coaches aim to design defensive game-plans that position defenders to minimize the value of potential passes a QB can throw based on the game situation and offensive positioning.\n\n\nKey highlights of our approach: \n\n> * **Intuitive, Modular Modeling:** All core aspects of the model should represent how football is naturally played, with each decomposed part easily modified or replaced without affecting the overall pipeline .\n> * **Trajectory-Based Analysis:** Defense is often played beyond just the arrival point of the ball, and we want to capture the motion of the ball through air space. Thus, we analyze an average of 1.3 million potential passes per second of game time using their trajectory provided by [NFL3D](https://dutta.github.io/nfl3d.html) (by Dutta et al).\n> * **Predictivity:** The metric should correlate with offensive passing output and be predictive of future offensive passing output.\n\nMuch of the high-level conceptual framework behind $PaVE$ comes from _off-ball scoring opportunity_ in soccer ([Spearman](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327139841_Beyond_Expected_Goals) and [Spearman et al.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/315166647_Physics-Based_Modeling_of_Pass_Probabilities_in_Soccer)).\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Methodology\nTo evaluate offensive value over all potential passes over the field, we _breakup_ the pass into 3 components: \n> 1. **Selection:** The probability that a given pass is selected to be thrown by the quarterback ($S(p)$)\n> \n> 2. **Influence:** Aggregate probability that a pass will be ultimately influenced by a member of the offense given that that pass is thrown ($I(p)$)\n> \n> 3. **Value:** Given that a certain pass is thrown, value gained for a completion ($VC(p)$) or incompletion ($VI(p)$)\n\n$PaVE$ is defined as the expected value of the pass taken over\n\\begin{align*}\nPaVE_F&=\\sum_{p\\in\\mathcal{P}}\\underbrace{\\left(VC(p)\\cdot I(p)+VI(p)\\cdot(1-I(p))\\right)}_{\\text{expected pass value}}\\cdot S(p) \\\\\nPaVE&=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{f=1}^N PaVE_f,\n\\end{align*}\nwhere $PaVE_F$ is per frame, and $PaVE$ is evaluated on a play with $N$ frames from snap to throw. We evaluate defenses as minimizing $PaVE$ and offenses as maximizing it.\n\nFor a given frame, we identify the quarterback's location as the starting location of possible passes $\\mathcal{P}=\\mathcal{L}\\times\\mathcal{T}$:\n> $\\mathcal{L}=[0,120]\\times[0,54]$ The field location to which the pass was thrown.\n> \n> $\\mathcal{T}=[0,4]$ The time of flight of the pass.\n\nAny given pass can then be specified as $p=(\\ell,T)$. In our implementation, we discretize both $\\mathcal{L}$ and $\\mathcal{T}$.\n\n\n### Influence\n\n#### Player Influence\n\nThe basic building block for pass influence is evaluating the probability that a player $j$ can arrive at a location $\\ell$ by the time the ball arrives there, $T$. We first define $ToA(j, \\ell)$ to be the time of arrival of player $j$ at $\\ell$. We assume players have a reaction time $t_{\\text{react}}$ to the pass and project their velocity at that time onto the vector from their location to $\\ell$ in order to get their initial velocity during ball pursuit. From here, we model player movement with constant acceleration up to a maximum speed until they reach $\\ell$. \n\nNow if $T\\geq ToA(j,\\ell)$, the player is projected to arrive in time to influence the ball, and otherwise they are not. To smooth this step function and account for temporal uncertainty due to unmodeled factors, we apply a logistic function. Lastly, we assume that the ball must have a height $z$ between $z_{\\text{min}}$ and $z_{\\text{max}}$ at $\\ell$ in order for a player to influence it. This is incorporated as a simple indicator variable on $z$, a component of $\\ell$. Altogether, we have\n$$\nP_\\mathrm{inf}(\\ell,T,j)=\\left(1+\\exp\\left(-\\frac{\\pi(T-ToA(j,\\ell))}{\\sqrt{3}\\sigma}\\right)\\right)^{-1}*\\mathbf{1}(z\\in[z_\\mathrm{min},z_\\mathrm{max}]),\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sigma$ is tuned on the provided dataset, with lower values representing less uncertainty and a function closer to a step function. \n\n<figure>\n    <figcaption style='text-align:center; font-size: 12px'>Figure 1: Example calculation of $PPI$ by team over 3D trajectory.</figcaption>\n    <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uditrana/BigDataBowl/master/bdb_throw_example.png\"/>\n</figure>\n\n#### Integrating Across a Pass Trajectory\n\nHaving modeled the probability that a player influences a given location at a given point in time, we can model potential player influence $PPI(p)$ on a pass $p=(\\ell,T)$ as a sequence of Bernoulli random variables corresponding to every player-time combination along the trajectory, with probabilities given by $P_{inf}$. They are ordered first chronologically, and within each timestep by defensive players coming before offensive players, since defensive influence only requires tipping the ball rather than catching it. To capture the relative ease of tipping over catching once near the ball, we give the chronological “tiebreaker” to the defense. \n\nBy passing the ball through this sequence of Bernoulli trials, we can calculate the probability that any of these player-time combinations is the first success (representing the play made on the ball). Integrating these probabilities over players and over the trajectory gives us the total potential player influence for the offense ($PPI_\\mathrm{off}$) and defense ($PPI_\\mathrm{def}$), with the remaining probability corresponding to the probability that neither team influencing the ball, denoted $PPI_{\\text{rem.}}$\n\n$$\n\\begin{align}\nPPI_\\mathrm{def}(p)&=\\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}\\underbrace{\\left(\\prod_{j\\in\\mathcal{O}\\cup\\mathcal{D}}\\prod_{t’=0}^{t-1}1-P_\\mathrm{inf}(\\ell(t’), t', j)\\right)}_{P(\\text{ball is still in play at }t)}~\\underbrace{\\left(1-\\prod_{j\\in\\mathcal{D}}1-P_\\mathrm{inf}(\\ell(t),t,j)\\right)}_{P(\\text{at least 1 defender influences ball at }t)} \\\\\nPPI_\\mathrm{off}(p)&=\\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}\\underbrace{\\left(\\prod_{j\\in\\mathcal{O}\\cup\\mathcal{D}}\\prod_{t’=0}^{t-1}1-P_\\mathrm{inf}(\\ell(t’), t’,j)\\right)}_{P(\\text{ball is still in play at }t)}~\\underbrace{\\left(\\prod_{j\\in\\mathcal{D}}1-P_\\mathrm{inf}(\\ell(t), t, j)\\right)}_{P(\\text{no defender influences ball at }t)}~\\underbrace{\\left(1-\\prod_{j\\in\\mathcal{O}}1-P_\\mathrm{inf}(\\ell(t), t,j\\right)}_{P(\\text{at least 1 receiver influences ball at }t)} \\\\\nPPI_\\mathrm{rem.}(p)&=1-PPI_\\mathrm{def}(p)-PPI_\\mathrm{off}(p)\n\\end{align}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\ell(t)$ refers to the location of the football at time $t$ along the pass trajectory along $p$. For the purpose of individual player rankings, we credit player $j$ with influence $PPI_j$ proportionally to the contribution of their $P_\\mathrm{inf}$ to the team $PPI$. See Figure 1 for an example of $PPI$ calculation over given $P_\\mathrm{inf}$ over a sample ball trajectory. \n\n### Selection\n\nPass selection consists of both QB ability and QB decision-making. For the former, we defined a distribution over passes $p=(\\ell,T)\\in\\mathcal{P}$ based on the historical distribution of the times of flight on passes based on the distance traveled on the field.\n$$H(p) = P(T|\\ell)$$\n\nAs for QB decision making, we know a QB is intelligently selecting passes that he deems likely to be influenced by his team. Conveniently, we have just developed an offensive influence metric in the previous section to model this.\n\nCombining these two factors, we have\n$$S(p) = H(p) * (PPI_{\\text{off}}(p))^{\\alpha}$$\n \n$\\alpha$ is a tuned hyperparameter and $S(p)$ is normalized to be a valid probability distribution over $\\mathcal{P}$.\n\n### Value\n\nDuring a play, a defense should look to position themselves to prevent the offense from hitting on explosive plays or throws likely to move the sticks. Yet, they must also be aware that if they offer low value passes too much space, it could incur valuable yardage after catch (YAC). To capture this, we model expected YAC (xYAC) and EPA to get expected EPA (xEPA).\n\n#### xYAC Model\nWe used XGBoost to train a tree-based model similar to the nflFastR xYAC model. From the tracking data we created a set of 21 features, upon which we trained the model. The model was trained on completions weeks 1-4 and validated on the remaining weeks, hyperparameters were manually tweaked to maximize accuracy. \n\nFor features we used the y-coordinate of the ball and the speed, x, y, distance at ball-catch for the 5 closest defenders. After training, the 3 most important features were found to be closest defender speed, ball y coordinate, and closest defender y coordinate. \n\nAfter training, we achieved a model with validation accuracy 81% with an average of 2.4 yards from the truth.\n\n#### xEPA Model\n    \nWhile largely similar in training and feature construction to the nflfastR EP model by [Baldwin et al](https://www.opensourcefootball.com/posts/2020-09-28-nflfastr-ep-wp-and-cp-models/). We forwent the time feature as predicting clock spent on a play was an unmodeled uncertainty.  \n\nThe model was trained on the entire publicly available play by play dataset from nflFastR using the weighting technique suggested by [Yurko et al](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.00998.pdf), following the same training algorithm and hyper parameters as [Baldwin et al](https://www.opensourcefootball.com/posts/2020-09-28-nflfastr-ep-wp-and-cp-models/). We found our EPA model has a 0.8 correlation with nflfastR EPA. \n\nNow we define the value of a completion $VC(p)$ by appropriately updating down, distance, and yardline based on $x+xYAC(p)$, where $x$ is the $x$-component of $\\ell$. Similarly, incompletion value $VI(p)$ is retrieved by incrementing down without adjusting distance or yardline. $xEPA$ can be calculated as the expected value of $EPA$ over completion probability."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<figure>\n    <figcaption style='text-align:center; font-size: 12px'>Figure 2: Demonstration of $PaVE$ and its constituent components on a sample play.

Notice that between frames 35 and 40, Kendricks takes away many of the available passes to Gordon, but by the time the pass is thrown, Gordon moves past him into an open area.

In the midst of this variance, we find that $PaVE$ is more predictive of passing yards gained than either EPA or passing yards itself. It also demonstrates a moderate correlation in predicting EPA. Predictions are on metric values averaged per dropback in consecutive 4-game bins over the 2018 NFL season.\n<br/>\n\n### Hyperparameter Tuning\nThere are four model parameters that we tuned based on ground-truth passes in the dataset:\n> * maximum player acceleration ($a_\\text{max}$)\n> * maximum player velocity ($v_\\text{max}$)\n> * influence logistic function parameter $\\sigma$\n> * selection parameter $\\alpha$\n\nThe first three parameters ($a_\\text{max}$, $v_\\text{max}$, and $\\sigma$) were tuned jointly to minimize the logistic loss between the individual potential player influence $PPI_j(p)$ and the true pass outcome. We tune the selection parameter $\\alpha$ with a logistic loss on the selection probability for the ground-truth pass $S(p)$. All parameters were tuned using PyTorch ([Paszke et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01703)) using the Adam optimizer ([Kingma and Ba](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980)). The final tuned values were $a_\\text{max} = 7.67\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{yd}}{\\mathrm{s}^2}$, $v_\\text{max} = 9.42\\,\\frac{\\mathrm{yd}}{\\mathrm{s}}$, $\\sigma = 0.31\\,\\mathrm{s}$, and $\\alpha = 1.2$.\nAdditional model hyperparameters were set as $t_\\mathrm{react}=0.2\\,\\mathrm{s}$, $z_\\mathrm{min}=1\\,\\mathrm{yd}$, and $z_\\mathrm{max}=3\\,\\mathrm{yd}$.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Applications\n\n### Defensive Positional Breakdown\n$PaVE$ broken down by position reveals an expected trend in Figure 4 wherein players in positions closer to the receivers and in more valuable areas of the field have better defensive $PaVE$.

If the Rams are game-planning for the Seahawks, they might shift the selection probability $P(T|\\ell)$ to reflect RW3’s propensity for the [moonball](https://youtu.be/DEKhWgrB0qY?t=795) while also simulating various defensive schemes to minimize DK Metcalf’s value based on his past route tendencies.

This was a great moment for Wide Receiver Jamison Crowder, and a terrible moment for the defensive backs on the Giants. What went wrong? How did Crowder catch the ball at the 24 yard line, and run another 76 yards for a touchdown? It started with Rookie Cornerback Grant Haley, getting a bit crossed up as Crowder cut into the middle of the field, giving Crowder some space to get a clean catch. Then Haley missed the tackle. But, the play does not stop with the pass completion, nor with the missed tackle. Crowder ran another 70 yards after the missed tackle. Where was the rest of the team defense? Where was the help?\n\nI introduce several novel **player help defense** metrics to measure the performance of players in situations like this, where the missed tackle, missed forced incompletion, and yards after completion do not tell the whole story of what was really happening with **all** the players on the defense during the passing play. In Crowder's case, every single defensive back on the field had an opportunity to stop Crowder prior to the 35 yard line if they had reacted optimally to the Quarterback's throw, whether they capitalized on it or not. Fortunately for Crowder, it was the latter. \n\n\n\n#  <div class='h2'> Motivation </div>\nWith the current defensive metrics, the defender who hustled to attempt the tackle and missed will be more penalized in his individual performance review than the defender who did not even bother to sprint to the receiver to attempt a chasedown tackle. The only reason is that there already exists an easy metric for capturing number of missed tackles, but the scope of quantifying the performance of a help defender is currently limited. However, computing metrics that quantify the difference in the help given and the help possible gives the opportunity to provide a more holistic picture of what impact a defender provides on the field.\n\nTo create metrics such as these, we need to establish the phases of a passing play and the roles of defenders during such a play. A passing play in the NFL can be divided into three primary phases: 1. Ball Snap -> Pass Forward; 2. Pass Forward -> Pass Arrived; 3. Pass Arrived -> Play End. The role of a defensive back evolves during a passing play, depending on whether the player they are responsible for guarding is the targeted receiver or not. The table below outlines the idealized defender roles during the phases of a passing play in the situations where they are guarding the targeted receiver versus where they are not.\n\n| Phase | Guarding Targeted Receiver | Not Guarding Targeted Receiver |\n|:--|:------|:------|\n| 1. Ball Snap -> Pass Forward  | Cover Assignment   | Cover Assignment |\n| 2. Pass Forward -> Pass Arrived | Intercept Ball or Force Incompletion| React to Help Cover Targeted Receiver |\n| 3. Pass Arrived -> Play End| Stop Receiver ASAP | Help Stop Receiver ASAP |\n\nPhases of the passing play and roles of defender depending on coverage assignment\n\n# <div class='h2'> Help Defense Performance Metrics </div>\nMy help defense performance metrics are:\n\n#### YATI: Yards After Timely Intersection\nThe number of yards that the help defender allows after the soonest possible moment that they could have reached the target receiver starting in Phase 2, Pass Forward -> Pass Arrived.\n\n#### MOFI: Missed Opportunity to Force Incompletion\nThe number of missed opportunities in which the help defenders could have arrived before the pass arrives to the receiver.\n\n#### HRT: Help Reaction Time\nThe time that it takes for the help defender to react and switch to targeting the player who has received the pass.\n\nWith the proposed help defense performance metrics, I can quantify the numer of yards that each defensive player gave up by not optimally moving to target Crowder in time and, well frankly, with enough chutzpah. Using this example, I will walk through how these metrics can be calculated and used to analyze the performance of an individual defender in switching from their receiver to the targeted receiver during Phases 2 (Pass Forward -> Pass Arrived) and 3 (Pass Arrived -> Play End) of the play. \n\nTo orient to the overhead view, I plot player and ball trajectories from Crowder's touchdown play below."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import matplotlib\nimport gc\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd\n\nfrom matplotlib import animation, rc\nfrom IPython.display import HTML\n\nimport field_py as field\nfrom animateplay_py import AnimatePlay\n\nimport helper_py as h\n\n# Animation for Crowder play\ndf_plays = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/plays.csv')\ndf_games = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/games.csv')\ndf_tracks = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week14.csv')\ngames = df_tracks['gameId'].unique()\nplayId = 3577\ngameId = 2018120908\nplay_df = h.slice_frame(df_tracks, playId, gameId)\nplay_df = df_tracks[df_tracks['playId'] == playId]\noffense = play_df[play_df['position'] == 'QB']['team']\nif 'away' in offense.values:\n    defense = 'home'\nelse:\n    defense = 'away'\nanim = AnimatePlay(gameId, playId, df_tracks, defense)\n# HTML(anim.anim.to_jshtml())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"anim\nHTML(anim.anim.to_jshtml())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <div class='h3'> YATI: Yards After Timely Intersection </div>\n\nIn the Crowder play, it is obvious that the defense reacted late, and did not rally to make up for lost time to tackle him before the touchdown. But, how do we quantify that? I propose quantifying this by modeling the time-optimal trajectory for the defender to reach the receiver, and calculating the number of yards the receiver gained between that optimal intersection and the true takedown. To compute this, my input is the trajectory of the intended receiver from pass forward until play end and the position of the help defender at pass forward. At each $(x,y)$ location of the receiver's trajectory during this period, I compute the time-optimal time it would take the receiver to reach that point, assuming the receiver is starting at his location at pass forward. I compare that estimate with the actual time elapsed for the receiver to reach that same point on the field given his known trajectory. The earliest point on the receiver's known trajectory where the defense could have reached at or before the receiver (according to the time-optimal time) is what I determine to be the optimal intersection point. The number of yards the receiver gained from that point to takedown or play end is the YATI. \n\nTo compute the time-optimal time, I use the time-optimal trajectory model from [(Burris, 2019)]('https://operations.nfl.com/media/3665/big-data-bowl-burris.pdf'). It estimates the time it takes for a player to arrive at a point that is $x$ yards away, running at $s$ speed, and turning throughout angle $a$.  If the model predicts the defender is unable to intercept the receiver before the end of the play, then the time returned is the timestamp for the end of the play, thus the calculation will return 0 yards after optimal intersection. In running my algorithm on the Crowder play, I return the following number for each defender:\n\n| Defender | YATI\n|:--|:------:|\n| Sean Chandler  | 74 yards |\n| Janoris Jenkins | 76 yards|\n| B. W. Webb | 63 yards |\n| Alec Ogletree | 75 yards |\n| Kam Moore | 68 yards |\n| Tae Davis | 74 yards |\n| Olivier Vernon | 74 yards ||\n\nYATI Per Player for Crowder Touchdown Play\n\n\nFor reference, if I put Grant Haley's trajectory into the model, his YATI score is 71 yards allowed. Haley missed an attempted tackle at 70 yards out. Therefore, the model output aligns well with the intent of someone reacting to the targeted receiver at the moment of pass forward. This intuits that this metric can be used as an asymptotic lower bound for the soonest possible moment that a help defender could have reached the targeted receiver.\n\n\nA graphical example of the algorithm's output is shown below using Sean Chandler's trajectory in the Crowder Touchdwn play. The connecting line (salmon colored) shows the time of pass forward on Chandler's trajectory and the time of Chandler's projected time-optimal intersection on Crowder's."},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%matplotlib inline\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport vis_py as vis\n\nplt = vis.plot_yati_ex()\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As evidenced by the graphic, the earliest possible moment Chandler could have reach Crowder is at the 26 yard line.

Thus, anytime the algorithm returns a time prior to pass arrival, that defender receives an uptick in this metric. In this case, Chandler could not have possibly reached Crowder in that time window, and would not be penalized. In this play, no help defenders (from this dataset at least) could have reached Crowder prior to the pass arrival."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <div class='h3'> HRT: Help Reaction Time </div>\nReactions take time. As a defender, one cannot recognize who the Quarterback has targeted and react in 0.1 seconds to begin tracking the targeted receiver, which this metric uses as its lower bound. To see when the defender has moved in such a way to indicate they have begun tracking the targeted receiver, I look at how the optimal time of intersection changes throughout the defender's actual trajectory.\n\nIn particular, at time $t$, the defender is predicted to time-optimally reach the receiver at $T_{opt}^{(t)}$. At the next measured time, $t+\\delta t$, the defender is predicted to time-optimally reach the receiver at $T_{opt}^{(t+\\delta t)}$. The help reaction time is the minimum $t$ when\n\n$$T_{opt}^{(t+\\delta t)} - T_{opt}^{(t)} <= 0.01$$\n\nIn other words, it is the minimum time it takes for the help defender to begin consistently moving in a way that suggests they are actively tracking the targeted receiver. I filter out a small number of degenerate cases that display $T_{opt}^{(t)} = T_{opt}^{(t+\\delta t)} >=$ time of play end.  \n\nThe graphic below depicts the moments in which Chandler could have caught Crowder if he were moving optimally starting with the moment of pass forward.

Below I plot the plus/minus average distance that a defensive player maintains from their target during Phase 1 (Ball Snap -> Pass Forward) of the play on the X axis. On the Y axis, I plot the average YATI that the athlete gives up per game. When just viewing the Cornerbacks, one notices that they cluster above the average for Coverage but the majority fall below average on YATI. Cornerbacks tend to pursue their targets more closely out of the gate. They also tend to maintain their trajectory in pursuit for well into Phase 2 (Pass Forward -> Pass Arrived) since they are often faced away from the Quarterback to maintain their speed to match their assignment. Meanwhile, Linebackers cluster around league average on coverage and the majority fall in the positive on YATI. Lastly, Safeties are all over the place. Their coverage is well below average.

Safeties have room to react quickly and they are usually far away from the play, allowing them to see what the Quarterback is doing and react immediately to the pass. Meanwhile, the Linebackers are in the middle of everything and may be trying to blitz the quarterback or embroiled in some other task in which they must extricate themselves as they react to the Quarterback. The Cornerbacks are sometimes in traffic, sometimes not.\n\nWhat is really interesting is the variance in YATI for a similar HRT score.

This will give teams more to discuss in film reviews.\n\n3. In comparing an athlete's HRT relative to their YATI, the athletes ability to get to where they need to be versus their intent to get there can be evaluated more quantititatively.\n\nFor instance, I am sure that Luke Keuchly would loved to have been given a number that quantifies his awesomeness on the tackle below from 2018.

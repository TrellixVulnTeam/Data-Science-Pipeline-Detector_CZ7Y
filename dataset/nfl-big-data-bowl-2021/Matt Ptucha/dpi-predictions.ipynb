{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The goal of this code is to determine if there is any one feature in a play that can determine the likelyhood of a defense commiting pass interference. While running this expairiment it looks as though the position of the line of scrimage in relation to the end zone is the key feature in a defense getting called for pass interference. The interesting point in this data is that defensive pass interference is only called on 1.35% of plays in the 2018 season. So it appears that while a defensive team might want to look at limiting these penelties that lead to free yardage it appears that the call is not likly to happen and if it does it is more likly to be called closer to the end zone. With this data it could be interesting to see how the time of the penalty is and the score at the time the penalty is called. This could allow a defensive coach to determine if it is a disipline issue with the athlete or if the penalty is being called in a tight game in the fourth quarter when addrenaline is taking over for the athlete."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3

As offensive players move in various patterns, the defense works together to prevent successful pass completions and then to quickly tackle receivers that do catch the ball. In this year’s Kaggle competition, your goal is to use data science to better understand the schemes and players that make for a successful defense against passing plays.\n\n![https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-competitions/kaggle/15696/logos/thumb76_76.png?t=2019-10-04-16-17-46](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-competitions/kaggle/15696/logos/thumb76_76.png?t=2019-10-04-16-17-46)\n\nIn American football, there are a plethora of defensive strategies and outcomes. The National Football League (NFL) has used previous Kaggle competitions to focus on offensive plays, but as the old proverb goes, “defense wins championships.” Though metrics for analyzing quarterbacks, running backs, and wide receivers are consistently a part of public discourse, techniques for analyzing the defensive part of the game trail and lag behind. Identifying player, team, or strategic advantages on the defensive side of the ball would be a significant breakthrough for the game.\n\nThis competition uses NFL’s Next Gen Stats data, which includes the position and speed of every player on the field during each play. You’ll employ player tracking data for all drop-back pass plays from the 2018 regular season. The goal of submissions is to identify unique and impactful approaches to measure defensive performance on these plays. There are several different directions for participants to ‘tackle’ (ha)—which may require levels of football savvy, data aptitude, and creativity. As examples:\n\n* What are coverage schemes (man, zone, etc) that the defense employs? What coverage options tend to be better performing?\n* Which players are the best at closely tracking receivers as they try to get open?\n* Which players are the best at closing on receivers when the ball is in the air?\n* Which players are the best at defending pass plays when the ball arrives?\n* Is there any way to use player tracking data to predict whether or not certain penalties – for example, defensive pass interference – will be called?\n* Who are the NFL’s best players against the pass?\n* How does a defense react to certain types of offensive plays?\n* Is there anything about a player – for example, their height, weight, experience, speed, or position – that can be used to predict their performance on defense?"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pylab as pl\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \n%matplotlib inline\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.utils import shuffle\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix,classification_report\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, GridSearchCV\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"week1 = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week1.csv')\nweek2 = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week2.csv')\nweek3 = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week3.csv')\nweek4 = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week4.csv')\nweek5 = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week5.csv')\nweek6 = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week6.csv')\nweek7 = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week7.csv')\nweek8 = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week8.csv')\nweek9 = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week9.csv')\nweek10 = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week10.csv')\nweek11 = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week11.csv')\nweek12 = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week12.csv')\nweek13 = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week13.csv')\nweek14 = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week14.csv')\nweek15 = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week15.csv')\nweek16 = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week16.csv')\nweek17 = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2021/week17.csv')\n\nData= week1.append([week1,week2,week3,week4,week5,week6,week7,week8,week9,week10,week11,week12,week13,week14,week15,week16,week17])\nx = Data.iloc[:, [3]].values","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Tracking data\nEach of the 17 week[week].csv files contain player tracking data from all passing plays during Week [week] of the 2018 regular season.

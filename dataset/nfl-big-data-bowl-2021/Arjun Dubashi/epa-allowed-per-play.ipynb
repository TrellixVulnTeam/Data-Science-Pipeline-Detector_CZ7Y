"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Objective: \n\nEPA is a metric known as expected points added. For a good explanation of EPA, this is a good summary: https://www.advancedfootballanalytics.com/index.php/home/stats/stats-explained/expected-points-and-epa-explained. It's generally viewed as a good way to view the impact of any particular play in football as it shows how certain plays affect winning and impact the number of points scored by a team.  \n\nIt's common to look at EPA/per play to evaluate individual quarterback, running back and receiver performance. In particular, Ben Baldwin and Sebastian Carl's site https://rbsdm.com/stats/stats/, has popularized the notion of looking at Quarterback by play by EPA per play. But it is less common to look at indivdual EPA per play stats for defensive players. \n\nSecondary player performance metrics are sparse compared to offensive player metrics(simply because there are more counting stats for offensive players). In order to judge secondary performance we can look at things like Interceptions or Passes Defensed. Neither of these are ideal, as both them only look at a fraction of coverage snaps over the course of the game. They also don't given enough value to a player who is so good in coverage that a QB decides to not even throw his way, which is not counted in these counting stats. \n\nThe other common way to measure secondary performance is to look at a more complex metric such as passer rating against. This is the passer rating that a defensive back or linebacker allows when they are thrown against in coverage. This will take into account all targets but it will not fix the scenario previously mentioned(it ignores the value created when a player is NOT targeted). Passer rating also does not take in account the relative value of all targets/receptions/incompletions, which EPA does. In addition, passer rating against usually requires people to look at all plays manually to determine targets and cannot be calculated automatically.\n\nA much more manual way to measure secondary performance is to use a manual system such as PFF grades(https://www.pff.com/grades) or a similar scouting system. This involves an intelligent analyst watching each play on the All-22 Coaches Tape and assigning grades to each play. This does account for the scenario talked about previously and should properly grade a shut down corner who is so good he receives few looks over the course of a game. However, this grading system is not particularly scalable and cannot be calculated automatically. \n\nIn this notebook, we'll seek to use measure the effectiveness of secondary play/coverage play, by looking at how much EPA a player allows when in coverage and try to calculate it automatically using tracking data and play by play data. We'll first try to calculate it for an individual game and look at the relationship between secondary performance and EPA Allowed per targeted play for a game, then we'll look at it over the course of a season. If successful, we should be able to use this metric as an automated way to look at secondary performance if we have access to tracking data. \n\nIn this metric, if the EPA allowed per targeted play is high, that means the player is poor in coverage and if the EPA allowed per targeted play is low, that means the player is good in coverage. \n\nAll Code is in this workbook, but is also available in github here:https://github.com/adubashi/NFLData. Additionally, the data that we precompute from tracking data is available here in this public data set: https://www.kaggle.com/arjundubashi/nfl-modified-tracking-data/. The process for precomputing this data is explained in this notebook, but it takes a while and thus we have precomputed it in order for the notebook to work with reasonable speed. \n\nNote: All data used to compute the metric is from the provided data in the nfl-big-data-bowl-data. PFF grades are used to prove the effectiveness of the metric but are not used in the calculation. \n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Algorithm:\n\nThe algorithm we'll use is as follows: \n1. For each passing play(that results in a completion, interception, incompletion, or secondary penalty), calculate the distance from the football for each player in coverage. \n2. We will determine that the defensive player closest to the football when the pass arrives is the player IN COVERAGE on that particular play. This is an assumption we are making. \n\n**Is this a correct assumption:**\nThis is a complicated question. If a defense is in man coverage, it's reasonable to assume that the closest defensive player to the targeted receiver when the pass arrives is the the player in coverage. In Zone coverage, there is more potential for error, but we still feel it is still a reasonable assumption to make. However, regardless of the coverage scheme the distance from the football/targeted receiver does not account for potential mistakes by secondary players that result in cascading events on a play. For example, if a defense player vacates his coverage assignment in either zone or man and another defensive player comes over to help out and ends up closer to the football when the pass arrives, then the player that helps out would be charged unfairly with the EPA associated with the pass, even though he was not the one who made the mistake. However, these errors have the ability to happen in any metric like this, even manual grades such as PFF. If we watched the All-22 of each play to determine every target(like PFF) that would be more accurate, but that would not be able to be calculated automatically using tracking data.  \n\n3. Assign the responsible defensive player for each play based on which defensive player is in coverage, intercepts the pass or commits a penalty in the secondary.\n4. Assign the EPA given up based on the player in coverage/responsible player. \n5. Aggregate the EPA given up per player to produce a report for a game.

Grades\n\nThis is cool, but how does it correlate to player performance? To prove effective of this metric, we need to use a separate source of defensive player performance data. To do this we'll use Pro Football Focus grades for the 1st game of the season in 2018, Falcons vs Eagles.\n\nIn this case, we'll try to compare the EPA given up per targeted play with the PFF grade in coverage.\n\nBecause giving up EPA is bad from a defensive perspective if the epa_per_targeted_play is NEGATIVE/LOW that means the defensive player played WELL in coverage. Conversely, if the epa_per_targeted_play is POSITIVE/HIGH that means the defensive player played BADLY in coverage.\n\nBecause of this, we would expect for the PFF Coverage Grade(which if it is high means the player played well, and if it is low means the player played poorly) to correlate negatively with the epa_per_targeted_play. Let's go ahead and look at the example. \n\nNote: The game report used below is precomputed for notebook speed, but we do the same comparison/plotting on the data previously plotted.

Mainly because we have proven that EPA per targeted play correlates strongly with PFF grade(which is completely manual) and passer rating against(which is partially automated but still relies on needing to know the targeted receiver for each play).

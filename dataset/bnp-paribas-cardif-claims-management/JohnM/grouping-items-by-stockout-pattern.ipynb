{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For some competitions it can be helful to find patterns of NA values or outliers, and cluster observations by similar patterns. Here I'm wondering what value there is in looking at stockouts and grouping items by those patterns. In our data we have typical department store groupings - family and department. This makes sense for the most part although for this exercise, the groupings aren't always helpful. If you're planning a Sunday summer picnic for instance, you might go over to Household for a tablecloth, Hobbies for a frisbee, and Foods for a big pack of ground beef (don't judge..:). A lot of other people are doing the same thing and so maybe the store runs out of those items. Demand is event-driven in this case and crosses department lines.\n\nWe don't really know if an item is out of stock or just no one bought it. I'll start with items having higher median sales and assume that a drop to 0 is due to a stockout. This is sure to be wrong in some cases."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nnp.set_printoptions(precision=2, suppress=True)\nimport pandas as pd\npd.options.display.max_columns = 2000\n\nid_cols = ['store_id', 'item_id']\nsales_cols = ['d_'+str(i) for i in range(1,1914)]\n\nsales = pd.read_csv('../input/m5-forecasting-accuracy/sales_train_validation.csv',\n                    usecols=id_cols+sales_cols, index_col=id_cols) \\\n            .astype(np.uint16).sort_index()\nsales","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Filter items at one store \nsales_ca1 = sales.loc['CA_1'] \\\n                 .assign(d_median=lambda x: x.median(axis=1)) \\\n                 .query('d_median >= 4') \\\n                 .drop(columns='d_median') \\\n                 .iloc[:, -28*24:]  # use the last two years\n\nsales_ca1","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check dept counts\nsales_ca1.groupby(sales_ca1.index.str[:-6]).size()\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The dendrogram from missingno is a quick way to see what sort of crossover there might be across departments and families.

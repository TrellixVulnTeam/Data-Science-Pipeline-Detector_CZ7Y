I argue that CV is a valid move if the split is applied based on unique card-ID. \n\nThis kernel is not only about giving a unique ID for transaction made by the same card, but also gives a chance to apply CV in the right way withtout data leak. I will discuss this in another kernel. \n\n\n# So How to identify unique card ID? \n\n\n### The idea behind : \n\nThe card ID is made using the 'card_k' features. Logically speaking, a debit/credit card number is around 16 digits. Think about!\n\nI found that a combination of card_k features : `['card1', 'card2', 'card3', 'card5',]` is giving me almost 14-16 digits. I used this as unique ID and found this pretty consistant. \n\nLet's see !\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np  \nimport pandas as pd  \nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\nWDR=\"../input/\"\n\nimport time\n# import datetime\nfrom contextlib import contextmanager\n@contextmanager\ndef timer(title):\n    print(title)\n    t0 = time.time()\n    yield\n    print(\"{} - done in {:.0f}s\".format(title, time.time() - t0))\n    ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"with timer('reading the data...'):\n    train_transaction = pd.read_csv(WDR+'train_transaction.csv')\n#     train_identity = pd.read_csv(WDR+'train_identity.csv')\n#      I found out we dont need train_identity for this. read below to understand\n#     train = train_transaction.merge(train_identity, on='TransactionID', how='left', left_index=True, right_index=True)\n    train = train_transaction.copy()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":false,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import datetime \ndef corret_card_id(x): \n    x=x.replace('.0','')\n    x=x.replace('-999','nan')\n    return x\n\ndef definie_indexes(df):\n    \n    # create date column\n    START_DATE = '2017-12-01'\n    startdate = datetime.datetime.strptime(START_DATE, '%Y-%m-%d')\n    df['date'] = df['TransactionDT'].apply(lambda x: (startdate + datetime.timedelta(seconds = x)))\n   \n    \n    # create card ID \n    cards_cols= ['card1', 'card2', 'card3', 'card5']\n    for card in cards_cols: \n        if '1' in card: \n            df['Card_ID']= df[card].map(str)\n        else : \n            df['Card_ID']+= ' '+df[card].map(str)\n    \n    # sort train data by Card_ID and then by transaction date \n    df= df.sort_values(['Card_ID', 'date'], ascending=[True, True])\n    \n    # small correction of the Card_ID\n    df['Card_ID']=df['Card_ID'].apply(corret_card_id)\n    \n    # set indexes \n    df= df.set_index(['Card_ID', 'date'])\n    return df\n\nwith timer('define real IDs...'):\n    train = definie_indexes(train)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Now we can see the data much much better than before\n\nNow we have the data indexed by `Cards_ID` and `date` .

It's normal that for the same card, we have different (P_emaildomain,R_emaildomain) per transaction. This doesn't hurt the consistancy of my definition of `Card_ID`\n\n3.

This is even more interesting because we can try to make a transaction from different devices but we are still using the same card. The Card_ID is more solid to create features IMHO.\n\n4. Use `Card_ID` instead of `TransactionID`. You will be able to create more features and more importantly, you will be able to link future transactions with past actions and get the fraudulant pattern.

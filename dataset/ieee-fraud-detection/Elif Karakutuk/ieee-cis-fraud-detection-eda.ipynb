Fraud detection is applied to many industries such as banking or insurance. In banking, fraud may include forging checks or using stolen credit cards. \n* This competition is a binary classification problem - i.e. our target variable is a binary attribute (Is the user making the click fraudulent or not?) and our goal is to classify users into \"fraudulent\" or \"not fraudulent\" as well as possible. \n\nIn this kernel I did deep dive Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on The IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection dataset to understand patterns of fraudulent transactions. Don’t forget to upvote if you find this kernel helpful. I suggest you also read the complete dataset overview and data description found in IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection page. https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/overview \n\nI intentionally share all of my code. My aim is to have a good EDA code base that will minimise the development process for the next projects at the backlog.\n\nYou can glance at my util function notebooks to have an idea how i eased the EDA process at my GitHub page. https://github.com/ElifKarakutukDinc/IEEE-CIS-Fraud-Detection ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) \nExploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns,to spot anomalies,to test hypotheses and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.\n\n* To take a closer look at the data take help of the '.head()` function of pandas library which returns the first five observations of the data set.Similarly `.tail()` returns the last five observations of the data set.\n* To find out the total number of rows and columns in the data set using `.shape`.\n* To see label of each columns in the data set using `.columns.values`\n* It is also a good practice to know the columns and their corresponding data types,along with finding whether they contain null values or not with `.info()`\n* The `.describe()` function in pandas is very handy in getting various summary statistics.This function returns the count, mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values and the quantiles of the data.\n* Few key insights just by looking at dependent variable are as follows:\n    * `.unique()`\n    * `.value_counts()`\n* To check missing values in the data set's columns using `.isnull().sum()`\n* To check `Outliers`: `A box plot` (or box-and-whisker plot) shows the distribution of quantitative data in a way that facilitates comparisons between variables.The box shows the quartiles of the dataset while the whiskers extend to show the rest of the distribution.\n* To check `the linearity of the variables` it is a good practice to `plot distribution graph` and look for skewness of features. Kernel density estimate (kde) is a quite useful tool for plotting the shape of a distribution.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Understanding & Wrangling:\n### Transaction Table \n    * TransactionDT: timedelta from a given reference datetime (not an actual timestamp)\n    * TransactionAMT: transaction payment amount in USD\n    * ProductCD: product code, the product for each transaction\n    * card1 - card6: payment card information, such as card type, card category, issue bank, country, etc.\n    * addr: address\n    * dist: distance\n    * P_ and (R__) emaildomain: purchaser and recipient email domain\n    * C1-C14: counting, such as how many addresses are found to be associated with the payment card, etc. The actual meaning is masked.\n    * D1-D15: timedelta, such as days between previous transaction, etc.\n    * M1-M9: match, such as names on card and address, etc.\n    * Vxxx: Vesta engineered rich features, including ranking, counting, and other entity relations.\n#### Categorical Features:\n    * ProductCD\n    * card1 - card6\n    * addr1, addr2\n    * P_emaildomain\n    * R_emaildomain\n    * M1 - M9\n\n### Identity Table\n    * Variables in this table are identity information – network connection information (IP, ISP, Proxy, etc) and digital signature (UA/browser/os/version, etc) associated with transactions.\n    * They're collected by Vesta’s fraud protection system and digital security partners.\n    * (The field names are masked and pairwise dictionary will not be provided for privacy protection and contract agreement)\n\n    * “id01 to id11 are numerical features for identity, which is collected by Vesta and security partners such as device rating, ip_domain rating, proxy rating, etc. Also it recorded behavioral fingerprint like account login times/failed to login times, how long an account stayed on the page, etc. All of these are not able to elaborate due to security partner T&C.

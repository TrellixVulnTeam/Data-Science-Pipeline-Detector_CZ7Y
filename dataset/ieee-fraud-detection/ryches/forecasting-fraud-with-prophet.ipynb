{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Motivation\nIn this kernel I explore some stuff tangentially related to this competition, but I slightly reframe the problem. Instead of trying to detect specific cases of fraud based on transaction characteristics I will look at trying to determine the amount of fraud on a given day or what percentage of transactions will be fradulent on a given day. This would be useful for a credit card company in order to adequetely prepare their fraud departments for the busiest times of year and may also influence their fraud models in order to be more diligent during these times of the year. \n\nIn this kernel I will be using FB Prophet, a very useful and simple tool for time-series forecasting. If you'd like to read about the math and theory behind this tool you can check it out at: https://peerj.com/preprints/3190/. At the heart of this tool is a [generalized additive model](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f9Rj6SHPHUU).

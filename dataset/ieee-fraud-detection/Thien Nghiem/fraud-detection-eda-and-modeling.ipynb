Several columns are homogeneous, therefore, prodvide no useful information in predicting the target variable (this may not be the case for transaction table since we are using a joined table)\n\n4. There is period of time where instances of non-fraud far exceed the usual proportion of non-fraud to fraud \n\n5. Basic understand of variables can help us do simple feature engineering\n\nWe will deal with each problem with the purpose of improving the prediction accuracy. But first, let's try a default XGBoost model provided by Vesta. We can use this model as a baseline to compare the improvement (or reduction) of each engineered feature, change, and alteration that  we made along the way.\n\n## Brainstorm\nBefore treating this problem like a black box of ensemble learning, it's worthwhile to take our hands off the keyboards and think about the problem of fraud detection in a more \"open-box\" way. There are a lot of intersting questions worth investigating before diving into the madness of hyperparameters tuning. Insights that could lead to trivial and sometimes important questions. Questions that take us on a journey of curiosity and fulfilment. \n\nFor the data scientists whose minds love to wander. This section is dedicated for silly and serious questions alike.\n\n**Scenario** :A Vesta executive storms in the office and excitedly tells everyone that an exciting project has fallen in their laps. It's the fraud detection problem. And he ask his people for some ideas of where to start, which features should be useful in prediciting fraud. He knows it is strange to ask the scientists before attempting any EDA or modeling. After all, they haven't seen a lick of relevant data. But he saids it would be great practive to dip the toe into the water before diving in without any direction. So let's start with the few things that were provided to us: transaction amount, time, card infor, identity, etc... Which information would give us a good start at cracking this problem?\n\nLet's define clearly what is a fraud transaction first. \"Fraud detection is a set of activities undertaken to prevent money or property from being obtained through false pretenses\" [Source](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/fraud-detection). Most common type of frauds are forging checks or using stolen credit cards. If a person got of hold of your card info, what should he/she do with it? After browsing on Reddit, I found some crude scenarios:\n\n1. If you drop your card, it's likely the person who found it by chance and commit a fraud would spend it on consumable and essential products like grocery and gas. The perp will likely go somewhere nearby and spend a larger amount than usual before the card get locked. So perhaps we should look at user's purchase history so that any activities or purchases that deviate from normal buying habit would stand out. But we don't have identifiable data, so we can't go on this route.\n\n2. If your information get hacked by careless purchases on some shady websites/gas stations, it's likely that your information will be sold to someone else who use your information for making fraud transaction. This person will make an online purchase and ship it to a distributor, who sells the good for cash and share the profit with the frauder. In this situation, the good is shipped to some far-away place from the user's home address. So the further the distance, the more a transaction looks like a fraud? No, of course not. People sends gifts all the times. But perhaps gifting 3 expensive laptops is slightly more suspicious than gifting a box of chocolate.\n    \n    **Feature Engineering:** Combine transaction amount, type of good, and distance together.\n    \n3. Fraud commited by someone close to you (family member: spouse, siblings, etc). It's rare, but it could happen.\n\n4. Prefered tools for committing fraud. We have learned previously in the EDA that Protonmail has exceptionally high fraud rate >95%. A quick google reveal that Proton is a email service that provide free, anonymous, end-to-end encryption email accounts. Quote from Proton website: \"ProtonMail is incorporated in Switzerland and all our servers are located in Switzerland. This means all user data is protected by strict Swiss privacy laws\". Meaning fraud perpetrator not only protected by the full extend of the privacy law, but also doing it at no cost. Similarly, we have other tools that also have abnormally high fraud rate such as:\n\n    * Browser: Comodo IceDragon, Mozilla/Firefox?? (not firefox, but perhaps is Comodo IceDragon but recognized as another version of Firefox?)\n    \n    * Operating system: \"other\" category has fraud rate of 60%.\n    \n    * Phone (or browser?): Lanix Ilium\n    \n    **Feature Engineering:** New features that emphasize the importance of these tools\n    \n5. Time of operation. Just like any other jobs, frauders operate at routinely hours that perhaps different from the real users. It is strange, at least to me, to make purchase decision to buy an iphone at 3 in the morning. Again, without historical data, this approach is dead in the egg.\n\n\n# Baseline Model\n\nModeling section is being explore in another private notebook since only 1 GPU instance is allow in Kaggle Kernel..."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

As machine learning algorithms don't understand things like strings, we need to convert them into numbers. This is called encoding.\n\nWe could use either label encoding, which replaces each category into a numerical representation, or use one hot encoding which creates a separate column for each category. In general, one hot encoding performs better. However, in this case we have columns with very high cardinality -- and since we have a large dataset, it's probably more practical to use label encoding which we'll do.\n\nTwo things we need to deal with for label encoding are missing values and unknown values. Missing values means the data is simply not there, whereas unknown values are values in the test set that we don't have in the training set.\n\nFor missing values, we'll just replace them with a label, e.g. the string `\"missing\"`. That's pretty straightforward.\n\nFor unknown values, that requires a bit more thought. The main question is whether or not we have all the categories a priori. If we know all the possible categories beforehand (i.e. fixed categories like gender, state, postcodes) then we can go ahead and devise a mapping beforehand for all possible values. However, sometimes categories only come in the future, like mobile phone models. In the latter case, we have no way of knowing all the possible future values, and thus we can't map them -- so we'll need another strategy, i.e. replace them with a different label like the string `\"unknown\"`.

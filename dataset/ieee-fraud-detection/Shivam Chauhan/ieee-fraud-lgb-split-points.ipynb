When you see that, think *zero*.\n\nSplit points for categorical dtypes depends on the `max_cat_to_onehot` which I have set to 128 - so categoricals in this data set are treated with a one-vs-all split. This means `feature==value` in the node split test, instead of the usual `feature<=value`. `max_cat_to_onehot` is by default set to 4, meaning categories with more values than this use splits based on target statistics, and the resulting split points have values like `1||3||5||7||8||9` which indicate which category codes go down the *left* branch. (But this is hard to show in bar charts... hence I used *one-vs-all splits*.)\n\nLightGBM keeps a separate bin for NaN values and at all node tests, records whether that bin goes left/right separately - this is not shown here (yet! Upvote to make me attempt something!)\n\n## What to Look For\n\nIn some ways what we **don't** see is more interesting than what we **do**. As with normal feature importances: if we see a feature is not used at all it is clearly redudant and should be removed. So seeing low gain (0) is very reliable but seeing high gain can *can* be misleading - it may be fitting noise.\n\nIf there is **one prominent peak** it means the feature acts a bit like a boolean, and perhaps would be better fed into the model that way (e.g. seeing a split value of 100, for feature 'foo', you could instead change column 'foo' to `foo<=100`.)  \n\nSimilarly if there are **several prominent peaks** it could imply the feature should be discretized/binned in a pre-processing step, as the less-often used split points may just be picking up on noise. See this [interesting old discussion thread on this subject of feature discretization][2].\n\nFor the TimeOfDay feature you may like to check out [my time series heatmaps notebook][4] that shows the density of transactions over time, and clearly indicates night time.\n\n [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format\n [2]: https://www.kaggle.com/c/porto-seguro-safe-driver-prediction/discussion/43886\n [3]: https://www.kaggle.com/tilii7\n [4]: https://www.kaggle.com/jtrotman/ieee-fraud-time-series-heatmaps\n [5]: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/math/nextafter\n [6]: https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/blob/master/src/io/bin.cpp\n [7]: https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM/blob/master/include/LightGBM/meta.h "},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2019-09-18T20:27:38.218468Z","start_time":"2019-09-18T20:27:30.843737Z"},"scrolled":false,"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"for col in use:\n    counts = split_points[col]\n    if len(counts) >= 4:\n        plot_it(col)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Gain Over Time\n\nThis part is more for illustration/teaching about gradient boosting.\n\nAs well as counting split points, we can look at how feature gain evolves as trees are added to the model.\n\nIn the gradient boosting learning process, each tree adds something to the training set predictions that moves the overall predictions closer to the target. It takes small steps towards lowering the loss function. Early trees are more like standard decision trees, fitting the big patterns. Later trees are more specialised, correcting small deviations, fine-grained wrinkles in the loss function: often little patterns, sometimes noise.\n\nAs features are incorporated into the model in early trees, their predictive power can run out, which is most notable for boolean features; at some point the existing predictions have accounted for all of the variance of the feature and they are no longer used in new trees.\n\nWe can see this by looking at gain statistics over time by passing the `iteration` parameter to the `feature_importance()` method.\n"},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2019-09-18T19:01:00.607167Z","start_time":"2019-09-18T19:01:00.594365Z"},"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"def make_importances(clf, divisions):\n    max_n = clf.num_trees()\n    thres = np.arange(1, divisions+1) / divisions\n\n    idx = pd.Index(clf.feature_name(), name='Feature')\n    importances = pd.DataFrame(index=idx)\n\n    for t in thres:\n        n = int(max_n * t)\n        c = f'count_{t*100:.0f}'\n        dat = clf.feature_importance(iteration=n)\n        importances[c] = pd.Series(dat, index=idx).astype(np.int32)\n\n    for t in thres:\n        n = int(max_n * t)\n        c = f'gain_{t*100:.0f}'\n        dat = clf.feature_importance('gain', iteration=n)\n        importances[c] = pd.Series(dat, index=idx).astype(np.float32)\n\n    return importances","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2019-09-18T19:01:01.265386Z","start_time":"2019-09-18T19:01:01.238761Z"},"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"importances = make_importances(clf, 5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"`V258` and `V258_count` reach high gain by 20% of the way through and are not used much after that. `card1` and `card2` are still being used with high gain throughout."},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2019-09-18T19:01:01.960114Z","start_time":"2019-09-18T19:01:01.931426Z"},"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"importances.sort_values('gain_100', ascending=False).head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2019-09-18T19:21:54.40033Z","start_time":"2019-09-18T19:21:54.368642Z"},"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"importances.to_csv('ieee_fraud_lgb_importances.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The blue bar indicates gain at 40% of the way through the learning process, and red marks the gain at the end."},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2019-09-18T19:01:11.074608Z","start_time":"2019-09-18T19:01:05.874689Z"},"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"toplot = importances.sort_values('gain_100').tail(80)\ntoplot['gain_100'].plot.barh(figsize=(12,20), legend=True, color='red', title='Feature Gain at 40% and 100%')\ntoplot['gain_40'].plot.barh(figsize=(12,20), legend=True, color='royalblue')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here we see `V258` and `V258_count` have *run out of steam* early, whilst other features are still gaining in importance..."},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2019-09-18T15:30:13.663407Z","start_time":"2019-09-18T15:30:13.142279Z"},"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"gaincols = importances.columns[importances.columns.str.startswith('gain')].tolist()\ntoplot = importances.sort_values('gain_100', ascending=False).head(10).copy()\ntoplot['gain_0'] = 0\ntoplot[['gain_0'] + gaincols].T.plot(figsize=(14,6), title='Cumulative Gain')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A different plot, show the most used features at the 20% point of training, and how their gain evolves after that..."},{"metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2019-09-18T15:30:21.977868Z","start_time":"2019-09-18T15:30:21.443297Z"},"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"gaincols = importances.columns[importances.columns.str.startswith('gain')].tolist()\ntoplot = importances.sort_values('count_20', ascending=False).head(10).copy()\ntoplot['gain_0'] = 0\ntoplot[['gain_0'] + gaincols].T.plot(figsize=(14,6), title='Cumulative Gain')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Conclusions\n\nNow we can inspect trained models to see **which points** in the feature space matter for fraud detection...

Features that capture *event* timing & behaviour are needed :)\n\nFor inspiration you should check out [an **extensive** index of **winning** and high ranking Kaggle **solutions** here][1] (and upvote if this helps you find something useful &mdash; I guarantee there are useful links there ;)\n\n [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/jtrotman/high-ranking-solution-posts\n [2]: https://www.kaggle.com/jtrotman/ieee-fraud-adversarial-lgb-split-points\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

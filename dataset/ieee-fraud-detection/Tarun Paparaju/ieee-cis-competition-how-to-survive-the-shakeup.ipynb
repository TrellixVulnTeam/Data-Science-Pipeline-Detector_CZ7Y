Some of these participants succeed in their endeavour and manage to stay at the top of the public LB. But, suddenly, when the private LB is revealed, a lot of these \"table toppers\" drop to low positions on the new leaderboard and miss out on a medal. But, on the other hand, many people who were low on the public LB jump up to high positions on the private LB. This phenomenon is called a **shakeup**.\n\nShakeups are most often caused by something called **overfitting** in machine learning. So, in this kernel, I will be explaining the most effective methods to identify and reduce overfitting, so that you can ensure a high place on the private LB and possibly even win a medal! Additionally, I will  be suggesting articles, blogs, and videos that explain these methods in greater detail.\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<font size=\"3\" color=\"red\"> Please upvote this kernel if you like it.

These error percentages are somewhat similar. But, if you look at the error percentages in model 2, they are 1% for cross validation and 2.5% for public LB. This is a comparatively massive gap between the CV and public LB scores. The public LB error percentage for model 2 is 2.5 times larger than the cross validation error. This shows that model 2 is overfitting to the cross validation data, and is not improving much on its test data performance. So, model 1 is more likely to perform better on a new private test dataset because it has very good CV and LB accuracies, and at the same, the gap between CV and LB is not very large. To summarize, **never go for a very small increase in LB score when the increase in CV score is very large, because this may lead to overfitting**.\n\nSo, look for an increase in CV score, but make sure that the gap between CV and LB remains small.

This is because the general trend in the data seems to be linear. But, instead, a highe degree polynomial is used and the data is fit perfectly without any error. This model may achieve 100% accuracy on the training data, but it will surely fail badly when tested on new data. This is because the model has **fitted the noise** in the training data, and in the process, it memorizes the data instead of finding the required pattern. Therefore, an overly complex model may lead to overfitting. But, at the same time, an overly simple model may lead to underfitting.\n\nSo, when a model starts overfitting, one way to reduce the overfitting is to reduce the complexity of the model. In a neural network, this can be done by reducing the number of layers in the network or reducing the number of neurons in the each layer. This can also be done for a gradient boosting model like LightGBM by reducing paramters like *max_depth*. By doing this, we are intentionally, reducing the complexity of the model in order to prevent overfitting from taking place."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<center><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/k6ZQvak.png\" width=\"800px\"></center>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The idea that reducing model complexity can reduce overfitting can be understood using the concepts of **variance and bias**.\n\n**Variance** is the amount that the estimate of the model will change if different training data was used. This quantity measures the capacity of a model to fit different datasets, and is therefore also a measure of the complexity of the model. A high variance means that the model has a very complex target function and is able to fit the training data very accurately. On the other hand, a low variance means that the model has a low level of complexity and is therefore unable to fit the training very closely. It may look like the more the variance the better, but in fact, the variance of any model should be moderate, and the \"moderate\" level of variance depends on the nature of the data. Some datasets demand models with a high variance whereas other datasets require a much lower level of variance. For example, the MNIST dataset can be modeled easily using a simple CNN, but a self-driving car dataset involving complex video and sensor data may require a more complex (high variance) model.\n\nThis brings me to the concept of bias. **Bias** are the simplifying assumptions made by a model to make the target function easier to learn.  This quantity measures the simplicity of the model, because simpler models often tend to make more assumptions to fit the data. A high bias means that the model has a simple target function and is therefore unable to fit the training very closely. On the other hand, a low bias means that the model has a high level of complexity and is therefore able to fit the training very closely.\n\n**Models with a high variance tend to have a low bias and vice-versa, and therefore, there is a direct tradeoff between them**.

In ensembling, the outputs from several models are combined (most commonly by averaging) to form one prediction vector. This final prediction usually has a greater accuracy than the other individual prediction vectors. This is because, when the predictions from different models are combined by averaging, the errors in the different prediction vectors are partially \"canceled out\" or reduced in magnitude. But, note that **this works only when the correlation between the different prediction vectors is considerably low, otherwise the ensemble would score similarly to the individual models**.\n\nThis implies that the **variety in the models is very important**. This means that one must ensemble models which are very different from each other in terms of architecture, hyperparameters, or algorithm in order to achieve maximum benefits from ensembling. For example, it might be a better idea to ensemble a LightGBM model with a Neural Network model instead of ensembling two LightGBM models. When more diverse models are selected, the diversity in predictions is also greater, and therefore, there is a higher chance of the ensemble to effectively reduce the errors in the predictions by \"canceling them out\"."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### A video explaining ensembling"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here is another video by Udacity explaining what ensembling is:"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"HTML('<center><iframe width=\"700\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/Un9zObFjBH0?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Demonstration"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now, I will demonstrate how ensembling can be used to help a model generalize better and avoid overfitting.

Basically, regularization methods ensure that the model maintains the same performance level on the validation data (and testing data) as it does on the training data.\n\nRegularization can take on many different types and forms based on the data and model under consideration. For example, a method called [Dropout](https://medium.com/@amarbudhiraja/https-medium-com-amarbudhiraja-learning-less-to-learn-better-dropout-in-deep-machine-learning-74334da4bfc5) can be used to improve the generalization of neural networks. This is a form of regularization. Similarly, one can also use the [L1 and L2 methods](https://towardsdatascience.com/l1-and-l2-regularization-methods-ce25e7fc831c) to reduce overfitting in a neural network. Once, this is a form of regularization.\n\nDropout is a regularization method that approximates training a large number of neural networks with different architectures in parallel.\n\nDuring training, some number of layer outputs are randomly ignored or “dropped out.” This has the effect of making the layer look-like and be treated-like a layer with a different number of nodes and connectivity to the prior layer. In effect, each update to a layer during training is performed with a different “view” of the configured layer.\n\nThe probablity of dropping a random neuron is called the dropout rate. For the demonstration below, I will use a dropout rate 0f 0.2."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<center><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/qFmZI6M.png\" width=\"600px\"></center>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### A video explaining regularization"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here is a video of Andrew Ng explaining the idea of regularization and how it can be used to combat overfitting:"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"HTML('<center><iframe width=\"700\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/u73PU6Qwl1I?rel=0&amp;controls=0&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Demonstration"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Regularization can be done in many ways, but for this kernel, I will demonstrating how **dropout** can be used to regularize neural networks."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Build model #1 (without dropout)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First, we will build a model with two hidden layers (200 neurons each) and a single-neuron layer with a sigmoid activation at the end to output the probability."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def get_model_one():\n    inputs = Input(shape=(X.shape[1],))\n    dense_1 = Dense(200, activation='relu')(inputs)\n    dense_2 = Dense(200, activation='relu')(dense_1)\n    outputs = Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')(dense_2)\n    \n    model = Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)\n    model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy', optimizer='adam', metrics=['acc'])\n    return model\n\nmodel_one = get_model_one()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Visualize model architecture"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"SVG(model_to_dot(model_one).create(prog='dot', format='svg'))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Train the model and store training history"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"history = model_one.fit(x=X_train, y=y_train, validation_data=(X_val, y_val), epochs=5, batch_size=128)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_loss_1 = history.history['loss']\nval_loss_1 = history.history['val_loss']\n\ntrain_acc_1 = history.history['acc']\nval_acc_1 = history.history['val_acc']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Visualize the training and validation statistics for model #1"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Accuracy"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = go.Figure()\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(\n    x=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], y=train_acc_1,\n    name='train', mode='lines+markers',\n    marker_color='orangered'\n))\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Scatter(\n    x=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5], y=val_acc_1,\n    name='val', mode='lines+markers',\n    marker_color='navy'\n))\n\n# Set options common to all traces with fig.update_traces\nfig.update_layout(title=\"Accuracy over the epochs\", yaxis=dict(title=\"Accuracy\"), xaxis=dict(title=\"Epochs\"))\nfig.update_traces(mode='lines+markers', marker_line_width=2, marker_size=10)\nfig.update_layout(yaxis_zeroline=False, xaxis_zeroline=False)\n\n\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In the above plot, we can see that the training and validation accuracies for the 200-neuron model diverge towards the last few epochs.

I met a lot of interesting, smart people who would like to start their career as data scientists. Most of the time I hear the same question, which is: where should I start?\n\nThe question inspired me to think of a solution that helps data scientists to exchange knowledge in a white-box mode. That is how I come up with my first open-source project: **ML-Navigator**\n\nML-Navigator is a tutorial-based informative Machine Learning framework. The main component of ML-Navigator is the flow. A flow is a collection of compact methods/functions that can be stuck together with guidance texts.\n\nThe flow functions as a map which shows the road from point A to point B. The guidance texts function as navigator instructions that help the user to figure out the next step after executing the current step.\n\nLike the car navigator, the user is not forced to follow the path. At any point, the user can take a break to explore data, modify the features and make any necessary changes. The user can always come back to the main path which the flow defines.\n\nThe flows are created by the community for the community. Therefore, your contributions and constructive feedback are very welcome.\n\nBig thanks to KI labs and my great team for supporting me at every step of this project."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Why ML-Navigator\nML-Navigator standardizes exchanging knowledge among data scientists.

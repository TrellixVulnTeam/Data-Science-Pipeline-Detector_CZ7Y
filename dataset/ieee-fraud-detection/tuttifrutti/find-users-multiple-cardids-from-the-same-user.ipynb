I'm going to use the results of the first one also as some of the methodology, so make sure you read it: \nhttps://www.kaggle.com/tuttifrutti/isolating-a-cardid\n\n### In many discussions the Card ID is called User ID. But a User can use multiple cards! and especially a frauding one!\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The assumption is that a fraudster - if he is a professional in the field- uses multiple cards to perform his art. He has a set of cards, and will try to pay with each one, expecting one or all to work.\n\nIn addition, recreating the users identificators enables to create variables about User behaviour, and help the models to spot the differences between regular users and fraudsters (such as, using multiple cards, multiples devices, multiples IP adresses ect..)\n\nLet's analyze a frauding sequence, and find a way to recreate it.\n\nIn the following image, we identified a cluster of cards. The transactions were made in a short time period, the amount was exactly the same, and so are id_19 and id_20 (which I interpret as a being some sort of machine or connection address). \nI have colored the card groups identified by the previous kernel (1 card with 3 transactions, 1 with 2, and 2 with 1. The aim of this one, is to group these cards under the same user. Here the grouping is quite straightforward right? same amount, same \"IP\", same device, same browser. <p>\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/RvNZSo5.png\" alt=\"ex1\">\n\n\nLet's have a look at a much more interesting example. Below, we can see that the cardID algorithms identified 1 card with 6 transactions. And we have in the middle two transactions from different card.\nWe can assume that all these transactions have been made by the same user.\nGrouping by device AND IP AND Amount, you'll group the 3 last transactions. The fact that in these group of 3, one of the transactions is connected to another group (the cardID group) enables you to create a group for the User.\n\nThe last transaction, acts like a **bridge** between the group of cardID, and the group of Device x Amount x IP x Browser\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/RPXTko9.png\" alt=\"ex1\">\n\n\n\nActually here, you have to have a close look at the data and make your assumptions, my grouping keys are the following for product C:\n- **Key1**: group by Amount, id_19 and id_20 (this is pretty restrictive as the amounts in group C are very specific, so is the \"IP\" in a short timeframe)\n- **Key2**: group by id_19, id_20, id_31, Deviceinfo (this is also restrictive on a short timeframe\n- **Key3**: group by cardID (already done)\n- perform the grouping on 0.1 day (with the day truncated, and then rounded, to have a pseudo sliding window of size 0.1)\n\n**Then find transactions that act like BRIDGES between those groups** (group by intersection of groups) <br>\nAt the end of the day, all these transaction will be found in the same User group (see column 'newgroup'):\n\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/P1bkNNL/Capture-d-cran-de-2019-10-04-12-50-34.png\" alt=\"ex1\">\n\n\n\nNow, it's time to compute it.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.incimages.com/uploaded_files/image/970x450/dirty-hands-1725x810_21760.jpg\" alt=\"handdirt\" width=500>\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.

I'm sure that, despite the fact that the I'm really tried on EDA to get some data characteristics (and I'm happy about the EDA), The data formatting and model training is not what I'm proud of. I keep this notebook as a score record for the next iterations to come.\n\nYou can find the other version with the highter score here:\n\n* [2# attempt : Focusing on data formatting and expanding windows](https://www.kaggle.com/code/thanakr/beginner-s-project-2nd-attempt)\n* [3# attempt : Pipeline, Feature Selection, More complicated models](https://www.kaggle.com/thanakr/beginner-s-project-3-pipeline-and-models)\n\n# Intro\n\nHere is my very first attempt to learn the time series data exploration and machine learning. After studied many MOOCS and some articles, I think the only way to make me understand is to practice the knowledge with some project. And here I am. This is still a work in progress. I don't think I can do everything in one go, thus the contents will be added eventually. If someone wander around and see this notebook, feel free to leave any comments or suggestions in the discussion panel (I'm pretty sure that, for the first project, my code is dirty). I would be really appreciated with any comment for further improvment.\n\n**Note:** Since this is a competition used in kaggle's time series course and the score I get just form copying the example that used statsmodels.tsa.deterministic.CalenderFourier() and statsmodels.tsa.deterministic.DeterministicProcess is **0.51090**.

6. Built model(s) and Validate model(s)\n\nFinally it's time for the model training. As I mentioned above, this very first attempt will be for the simple linear regression model and the metrics will be the \"Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error\" (RMSLE), in other words, the submission score itself. I am aimimg to surpass the benchmark score of **0.5109** from the Kaggle time series course. I didn't expect anythin more than \"abysmal\" for the result in this first attempt with simple model and inexperience feature eugineering. However, I hope that the next iterations to come will yield better results. \n\n### Let's do it.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n\nln = LinearRegression()\nln.fit(x_train,y_train)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-10T14:16:53.330861Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-10T14:16:53.33142Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-10T14:17:09.882404Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-10T14:16:53.331384Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-10T14:17:09.881204Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"y_pred = ln.predict(x_test)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-10T14:17:09.885527Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-10T14:17:09.88653Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-10T14:17:09.944309Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-10T14:17:09.886479Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-10T14:17:09.943358Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 7.

Problems Notes\n\nThese are the notes I plan to use in the next iteration of this project or others. I plan to do this project as a freely unguide - simple project to see what would happen if I want to try time series with some crude skills and knowledge. I hope that, as I keep going, I will develop better understanding and more mastery. I hope that this note book in the next next iteration will be better and more robust.\n\n\n### Problems\n1. Need more coding, statistic and ML mastery to fully tackle the problem \n    * -> Practicing\n2. Still Have no idea how to deal with the different selling patterns between different Product Families.\n    * -> Some great notebooks are dealing with this by using more complicated models. I will try to understand them.\n3. I feel like the Oil price must be beneficial for training the model. Just don't know how to utilize it.\n    * -> Explore more idea from other notebooks\n4. Need more practice using Pandas snd Matplotlib.\n5. Sometimes I'm not sure how to impliment the insight from the EDA into the model.\n6. Lacking of project planning experience seems to cost me a lot of time fixing and refixing the code and also the procedure. For example, I had construct the holiday dummy table just to find that I need to to the entire formatting and dummying again in the main calendar DF since the Holiday DF are note date complete.\n    * -> I guess this is how the lesson is learned\n7. Memory leak: I was writing code without thinking about the memory leak. This is really bad practice and the first time I got it in ML. This stall my entire process and need to be fix right away.\n    * -> Concern more \n    * -> I Google and found this great [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansanagapati/14-simple-tips-to-save-ram-memory-for-1-gb-dataset/comments). Upvoted.\n        * simpler methods I think I'm gonna use here in this notebook are:\n            * Free Memory using gc.collect()\n            * Datatype Conversions¶ (for convert dummy or categorical data into category using data.astype('category')\n            * Dealing with memory leak by using in-function variable (which will be cleared after the function done executing.\n    * When merging BIG dataframes, it might be better for limited memory to convert the bigger one in to csv at a managable chunk using chunksize= pharameter.\n    * Still, due to my lake of experience the DF structure in have in mind still won't work. It got over 4M rows. Need to fix immediately.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 9. Conclusion\n\nThe result is really bad.

Footnote\n\nIt's been a really daunting task for a first-timer like me just to do this from the beginning to the submission. For this simple-educational competition, and using only the linear regression model, It took me many more days than I expected. However, after the submission, I felt really happy that I had finally finised the first attempt.\n\nThe score I got is **3.44178**, which, is noting less than an \"abysmal\" just like the level I expected to have compared to the **0.5xx** from the Kaggle Course. Still, I'm very happy about the process and what I've learn from practicing with this notebook.\n\nThe code here, I'm sure, must be very scrappy, but for the next iteration with more experience and more complicated model (I'm thinking about DeterministicProcess(), Fourier Combination, Forest etc.), I hope to produce better result and better understanding of data science.\n\nFor Kaggle and everyone that read through my notebook, thank you.","metadata":{}}]}

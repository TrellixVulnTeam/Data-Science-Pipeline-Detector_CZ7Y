Obviously we cannot assume oil didn't exist at these days or somehow didn't have a value.\nSo while we could try researching the oil prices on these days, given we have over 2000 entries and thus a very small amount of missing data, I will just fill the missing values with the inbetween of the most previous and next non-null entry.\nI do this by first taking the indices of all missing values, then use both the forward-fill and backward-fill method and just average the two entries for the missing values.\nAfter that, formatting the datetime correctly and plotting the oil-prices shows a decent graph with nothing seeming out of place.\n\nHowever apart from a massive drop of oil prices from 2014-2015, it's also worth noting that this data is actually a false-friend. For a future prediction, the oilprice cannot be known in advance.

Appearently the same cluster can cover several cities.\nThis is important as it undermines most information we could get from a cluster. If the clusters where in the same city, it could be assumed they are not considered competitors and thus their sales could be added up to reduce complexity - as we'd assume that people just chose the first store of the cluster they came across, instead of making a conscious decision to go to a specific store. However given clusters neither cover similar store-types nor regions, it's hard to determine what kind of information we can actually get from the cluster.\n\nMaybe a later look into sales-numbers can offer more significant differences inbetween the cluster. If not we might need to do some more research on how the cluster came to be assigned.\nHowever matter of fact is, at the current level of insight, the clusters don't seem to contain any distinct information that would make it a good predictor for any model. So let's keep it in mind as a column that might be safe to drop.\nSpeaking of dropping, taking a quick look at cities and states, we see each city has one state. So there is no trouble with doubled city-names. However we got some states with several cities. Meaning dropping either column is currently not feasable.\n\nIn the end, there isn't much to do right now. The table contains a lot of distinct entries which may or may not provide useful information for a later regression. We just need to keep in mind it's categorical data and must be encoded properly.\nFor the encoding we need to determine wether or not there is any significant relationship inbetween sales and cities or states, as this could be used to justify ordinal-encoding with it's implied order. However given the size of distinct values for both cities and states, One-Hot-Encoding might introduce a lot of additional dimensions for the regression and as such should be avoided if there is no significant relationship to be found inbetween either and the target.\n\n## Judgement\nGiven most cities have only one shop to begin with, the model has nothing to gain here. Even if we .groupby(\"state\") we get to little variation. We'd need significantly more entries to have a chance to gain some information out of it that isn't just noise. 10 would still be to little for that, let alone 1 shop which means it's identical to the shop-ID as far as distinct information goes.\n\nFor the cluster I can't find any relation or information that would imply these have any significance. Thus I could try including it just for fun, but I can't argue it's important.\n\nNow I haven't looked into type, but given it's only 5 entries we can easily OneHotEncode it without bloating the model all to much. And it is to assume the type of store has influence on their sales-numbers in general. Plus we'd want to at least give the model a chance to find some generalizing information and I just decided to discard all other information that would allow any kind of grouping of shops.\n\n## Conclusion\n- test with type and cluster\n- test with type\n- note that without inherant order, OHE is necessary and this will heavily lengthen the dataframe","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(df_stores.shape)\ndf_stores.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-12T13:52:41.507566Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-12T13:52:41.508562Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-12T13:52:41.525776Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-12T13:52:41.508512Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-12T13:52:41.524774Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_stores.groupby(\"state\").count()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-11T13:59:47.958489Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-11T13:59:47.958826Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-11T13:59:47.972534Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-11T13:59:47.958791Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-11T13:59:47.971327Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_stores.type.value_counts()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-10T14:58:54.347562Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-10T14:58:54.347805Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-10T14:58:54.355737Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-10T14:58:54.347779Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-10T14:58:54.354952Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_stores.cluster.value_counts()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-10T14:59:02.901313Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-10T14:59:02.90201Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-10T14:59:02.910324Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-10T14:59:02.901968Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-10T14:59:02.909551Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_stores[[\"type\",\"cluster\", \"city\", \"state\"]].groupby([\"cluster\", \"type\", \"city\"]).count()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-11T13:57:13.290714Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-11T13:57:13.291014Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-11T13:57:13.314636Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-11T13:57:13.290985Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-11T13:57:13.313886Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_stores[[\"city\",\"state\"]].groupby([\"state\", \"city\"]).count()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-10T15:18:06.340228Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-10T15:18:06.340493Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-10T15:18:06.354728Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-10T15:18:06.340466Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-10T15:18:06.35412Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_stores[df_stores.cluster==10].store_nbr.value_counts()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-12T13:52:27.646421Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-12T13:52:27.646776Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-12T13:52:27.668781Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-12T13:52:27.646744Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-12T13:52:27.66754Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(25,10))\nsns.boxplot(#x=\"cluster\", \n            x=\"store_nbr\",\n            y=\"transactions\", \n            data=df_transactions, \n            #hue=\"cluster\", \n            ax=ax, \n            dodge=False)","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# transactions\n\nSecond to last will be the transactions table.

Which in itself is very bare information, as obviously promotions and as such sales affect different items differently. For example, if a medium priced product is reduced to compete with a cheap product, people might grab the reduced one instead of the generally cheap one, not generating any additional sales. Imagine toilet paper, just because it is cheaper, doesn't mean people will buy more of it. Unless they buy it in bulk. Point is, there are different strategies of people to react and utilize sales of different products and as such, the mere information how many products are on promotion at a given time, is a good generalization (as we are in no position to predict every single sale) BUT it also means this feature will contain a lot of noise and unless the noise cancels eachother out, might propably not be the best predictor.\n\nLong ramble aside, it's also important to format the date correctly and infer the weekday. We gotta OneHotEncode that so the model can identify specific behavior for each day of the week.\n\n# Conclusion\n\n+ Join oil-price, store-type and store-cluster\n+ [edit: add columns for time-series related EDA]","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_train.loc[ : , ['date', 'sales']][df_train.date>=\"2015-07\"]","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-14T09:45:11.102235Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-14T09:45:11.102703Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-14T09:45:11.173316Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-14T09:45:11.10267Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-14T09:45:11.172457Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(20,7))\ndata_lim = df_train.loc[:, [\"date\", \"sales\"]][df_train.date>=\"2015-06\"].groupby(\"date\").sum()\ndata_pre = df_train.loc[:, [\"date\", \"sales\"]][df_train.date<\"2015-06\"].groupby(\"date\").sum()\ndata = df_train.loc[:, [\"date\", \"sales\"]].groupby(\"date\").sum()\n#data.head()\nax.plot(data_lim.rolling(window=30,\n                    center=True,\n                    min_periods=15).mean(),\n        aa=True,\n        color=\"red\",\n        alpha=0.4\n       )\nax.plot(data_pre.rolling(window=30,\n                    center=True,\n                    min_periods=15).mean(),\n        aa=True,\n        color=\"blue\",\n        alpha=0.4\n       )\nax.plot(data.rolling(window=365,\n                    center=True,\n                    min_periods=182).mean(),\n       aa=True,\n       color=\"black\"\n       )\nax.plot(data_lim.rolling(window=365,\n                        center=True,\n                        min_periods=182).mean(),\n       aa=True,\n       color=\"red\")\nax.plot(data_pre.rolling(window=365,\n                        center=True,\n                        min_periods=182).mean(),\n       aa=True,\n       color=\"blue\")\nax.legend(['30 day rolling window', '365 day rolling window'])\nax.set_title(\"Sales Trend - month + year\", fontsize=20)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-19T09:24:52.29664Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-19T09:24:52.296953Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-19T09:24:53.044207Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-19T09:24:52.296922Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-19T09:24:53.043416Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"1. red = post 2015-06\n2. blu = pre 2015-06\n\nWe can see a couple of notable things.\n* over the years we see an upwards trend of the sales.\n* over the month-wide average, there is a clear spike at the end of the years, which gets more prominent in later years\n* 2013 is almost flat apart from christmas\n* 2014 is all over the place with large spikes an valleys with another spike mid 2015 that seems to establish a new baseline\n* after about half the year of 2015, the chart seems to flatten out, showing only 3 majore spikes\n    * two end-of-year spikes as usual\n    * one spike around the end of the first quarter 2016, propably related to the April 16, 2016 earthquake and subsequent donations happening\n* the monthly line is ragged, showing some periodic behavior","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(20,7))\ndata = df_train.loc[:,[\"date\",\"sales\"]].groupby(\"date\").sum()\nax.plot(data.rolling(window=7,\n                        center=True).mean(),\n       color=\"blue\")\nax.set_title(\"Moving average sales per day over a weekly window\", fontsize=20)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-13T10:54:04.511497Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-13T10:54:04.511826Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-13T10:54:05.058524Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-13T10:54:04.51179Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-13T10:54:05.057506Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This time we see it more clearly.

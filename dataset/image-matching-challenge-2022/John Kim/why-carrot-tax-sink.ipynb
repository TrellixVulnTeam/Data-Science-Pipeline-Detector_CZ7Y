Limestone and oysters are the sources. She used pearls. Her drink is somewhat related to the first chemical component humanity ever found. Many industries are using it as well. Portland cement is manufactured with carbon something. Runway. Highway. Construction. Potash. You name it. When you say carbon, you look smart and powerful. When you say chlorine, you look stupid. Ooops, the ozone. This dots are rare and unstable. Unlike `abundant` carbon which you can find anywhere, the ozone is 1 in million particles. Yet, it was good enough to protect all living beings from harmful lights. However, one free chlorine particle can do so much damage to the ozone. The melting North and the rising sea level might contribute to dry wet dry wet vibrations of abnormal rise in chlorine into the atmosphere. It is just strange. The whole thing is just strange. If chlorine did actual `permanent` damage, why do we pay tax for the carbon? It gives an unbreathable burden to our key labors. Truckers. Aviation. Carbon temporary. Chlorine is permanent. Do chlorine tax. No carbon. I am sure some smart people can do carbon sink anytime and make a profit, influence, and power. Do you care about us? I see no tears and there is a hole. Thank you very much. You are very helpful.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Options\n  1.

The actual library can be installed from [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/BERTSimilarity/).\n\nThe Github for the library can be found [here](https://github.com/abhilash1910/BERTSimilarity). The library uses the feed forward BERT layer (without backprop) and provides BERT embeddings for sentences. These sentence vectors are then analysed with respect to cosine distance for similarity measurement.\n\nThe BERT feed forward architecture as well as the scaled attention layer (for finetuning and pretraining) is provided.\n\n<img src='https://miro.medium.com/max/1115/1*_7-cBzOXfL175oeAgYPeHA.png'>\n\n\n\nThe Google Research Github for BERT is [attached](https://github.com/google-research/bert/) and the associated paper is [provided](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Transformer Architecture \n\nThe Transformer architecture which forms the most significant part of BERT contains feed forward nets , multi head attentions and layer normalizations .

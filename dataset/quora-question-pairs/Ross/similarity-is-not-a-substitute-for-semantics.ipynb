The types of errors we are likely to encounter are:\n\n - Cases where the weights of two contextually different expressions are similar (e.g. pair 28). In this case 'ask for' and 'make' may have very similar weights due to similar counts of the term throughout the corpus, but have a fundamentally different meaning.\n - Algorithmic errors - where the features indicate difference to an observer but not to the algorithm (e.g. pair 24 where the similarity is 48% and the weight ratio is 75%). This could potentially be improved by tweaking the training parameters, adding more training data and executing more epochs.\n\nIn addition, our data derivation has several shortcomings. Namely: we have done no canonization of the terms in the corpus. This means that the following terms will be considered different (and have different counts and weights according to the tf-idf):\n\n - 2016-12-01 and 1st of December 2016\n - Youtube and YouTube\n - india and India\n\nThis problem can be solved through a similarity matching and some regular expressions.\n\nAnother issue we haven't addressed is the semantic closeness of terms in the question pairs for cases like:\n\n - Holland and The Netherlands\n - Holland and France (both may have equal frequency in the corpus and equal weights but have different meaning)\n\nThis problem can be resolved through vectorization of the terms and taking cosine of their values.\n\nUnfortunately those tasks are beyond the allocated time or hardware of my current participation (30 hours and Acer Revo One, respectively), but had time been abundantly available, I would work on the following additional features:\n\n - Regular expression parser to canonize the training and test corpus\n - Cosine of the terms of each question pair\n - N-gram derivation and comparison\n\nI'm eager to hear your constructive criticism and suggestions for improvement!"}],"metadata":{"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}

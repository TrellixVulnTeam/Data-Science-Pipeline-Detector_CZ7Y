To eliminate this variation, so that it does not cause further problems, we use lowercasing technique to eliminate the sparsity issue and reduce the vocabulary size.\n\nDespite its excellence in reducing sparsity issue and vocabulary size, it sometimes impacts system’s performance by increasing ambiguity. For example, ‘Apple is the best company for smartphones ‘.

Inflection is removed from the token to get the base form of the word. It helps in reducing the number of unique tokens and redundancy in data. It reduces the data dimensionality and removes variation of a word from text.\nThere are two techniques to perform normalization. They are Stemming and Lemmatization.\n\n### Stemming\nStemming is the elementary rule-based process of removal of inflectional forms from a token. The token is converted into its root form. For example, the word ‘troubled’ is converted into ‘trouble’ after performing stemming. \n\nThere are different algorithms for stemming but the most common algorithm, which is also known to be empirically effective for English, is Porter’s Algorithm. Porter’s Algorithm consists of 5 phases of word reductions applied sequentially.\n\nSince stemming follows crude heuristic approach that chops off the end of the tokens in the hope of correctly transforming into its root form, it sometimes may generate non-meaningful terms. For example, it may convert the token ‘increase’ into ‘increas’, causing the token to lose its meaning.\n\n### Lemmatization\nLemmatization is similar to stemming, difference being that lemmatization refers to doing things properly with use of vocabulary and morphological analysis of words, aiming to remove inflections from the word and to return base or dictionary form of that word, also known as lemma. It does full morphological analysis of the word to accurately identify the lemma for each word. It may use a dictionary such as Wordnet for mapping or some other rule-based approaches.\n\nWe have used the Lemmatization to perform normalizaion. You can use Stemming as well since it has been found that the results yielded by Lemmatization and Stemming are not much different.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def lemmatize(s):\n    lemma = []\n    wnl = WordNetLemmatizer()\n    for doc in s:\n        tokens = [wnl.lemmatize(w) for w in doc]\n        lemma.append(tokens)\n\n    # Removing Stopwords\n    filter_words = []\n    Stopwords = set(stopwords.words('english'))\n\n    #ab = spell('nd')\n    for sent in lemma:\n        tokens = [w for w in sent if w not in Stopwords]\n        filter_words.append(tokens)\n\n    space = ' ' \n    sentences = []\n    for sentence in filter_words:\n        sentences.append(space.join(sentence))\n        \n    return sentences","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Stopwords\nIn the above function, you can see stopwords are being removed from the questions.

Let’s take an example to understand the procedure of LSTM.\nThe first step in our LSTM is to decide what information we’re going to throw away from the cell state. This decision is made by a sigmoid layer called the forget gate layer. It looks at ht−1and xt, and outputs a number between 0 and 1 for each number in the cell state Ct−1. A 1 represents “completely keep this” while a 0 represents “completely get rid of this.”\nThe next step is to decide what new information we’re going to store in the cell state. This has two parts. First, a sigmoid layer called the input gate layer decides which values we’ll update. Next, a tanh layer creates a vector of new candidate values, C~t, that could be added to the state. In the next step, we’ll combine these two to create an update to the state.\nFinally, we need to decide what we’re going to output. First, we run a sigmoid layer which decides what parts of the cell state we’re going to output. Then, we put the cell state through tanh (to push the values to be between −1 and 1) and multiply it by the output of the sigmoid gate, so that we only output the parts we decided to.\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Vanishing Gradients Problem\nThe problem that vanilla RNNs face is vanishing gradients problem.

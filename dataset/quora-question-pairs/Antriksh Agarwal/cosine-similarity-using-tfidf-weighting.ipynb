We'll run it over the train.csv to check how good it performs. It is still running on my machine, and I trust this kernel very less (has been going down like after every cell I execute), so I might as well just post the output instead of running it on this again (with the code obviously).\n\nThe first is simple enough, gather the data. I am dropping the useless columns in the train data, i.e. I dropped the qids. If you are running the following cell, you need to be warned it takes some time.\n\nThere is also another quirk with this code snippet. I noticed in the questions that some of them have very less number of characters, like even 1 character questions (what were they trying to write '?'), parsing a question with less than 10 characters did not make much sense to me. The question (and its pair) containing less than 10 characters has been left out from the question list, but you can obviously use it if you would like."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"19c2ffbd-8d0e-7f92-4165-fc279ba249cd"},"outputs":[],"source":"train = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\n\ntrain_qs = train[['id', 'question1', 'question2', 'is_duplicate']]\n\nqlist = []\ncount = 0\nfor row in train_qs.itertuples():\n    try:\n        if len(str(row[2])) > 10:\n            q1 = word_tokenize(row[2].lower())\n        if len(str(row[3])) > 10:\n            q2 = word_tokenize(row[3].lower())\n        qlist += q1 + q2\n        count+=1\n        if count%100000 == 0:\n            print('At'+str(count))\n#        qlist.append(q2)\n    except TypeError:\n        pass\n\n# print len(qlist)\nqlist = dict(Counter(qlist))\nimport json\nwith open('qlist.json', 'w') as f:\n    f.write(json.dumps(qlist, indent=2))\nprint('All Questions added to list')"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"4b2acae1-9c6b-bc32-e5fb-92f88ef34df5"},"source":"Okay, this is the final stage.

This is the most basic NLP implementation possible to compare two sentences using a tfidf representation of the two sentences and hence might not get a good response. This is also an unsupervised method which is basically ignoring the fact that there is a train.csv file available to \"train\" over.\n\nThank you, I appreciate anyone who reads this on spending some time on this kernel too. I would also like suggestions and methods for improvement. Also, since this is an unsupervised method I ran, could this method somehow be used in a supervised fashion, like use the cosine similarity as a feature on some other learning method.\n\nI am mostly looking for NLP methods to implement for this and would appreciate any help/motivation to better methods around (not using deep learning, for now).

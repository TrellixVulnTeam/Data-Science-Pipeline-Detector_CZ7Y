This class of processes is defined through linear relationship between observation and noise factors.\n\nJust to indulge my inner nerd, I will go top-down in this one and start from a high level definition - because why not :-) A linear process is a time series $X_t$ defined by:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    X_t = \\sum_{u = -\\infty}^{\\infty} \\psi_u \\epsilon_{t-u}\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $\\epsilon_t$ is a white noise series and \n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\sum_{u = -\\infty}^{\\infty} \\left|\\psi_u \\right|^2 < \\infty\n\\end{equation}\n\n\nTranslated to plain English:\n* (in our context) white noise a serially uncorrelated sequence of random variables with zero mean and finite variance. For a general definition (and the origin of the color convention) I can recommend the Wikipedia entry: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_noise\n\n* it is a linear combination - potentially infinite and depending on both past and present - of a white noise series\n\n* in the real world it has to be causal $\\implies$ depending on a finite number of past values\n\n* it is a unified framework for handling different types of data generating processes\n\n* for the mathematically inclided person reading this: huge parts of the theory behind ARMA processes pop up as special cases / corrolaries from results in functional analysis, specifically the [Hilbert projection theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_projection_theorem) and [spectral theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_theorem); the requirement on sum of squared values being finite correspond to belonging to an $l_2$ space for our sequence: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lp_space\n\n* only needs second order statistics (variance) $\\rightarrow$ works best for elliptical distributions (e.g. Gaussian)\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n## AR processes","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The simplest (non-trivial) example of a linear process is an autoregressive process of order $p$:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n    X_t = \\sum_{i= 1}^p \\phi_i X_{t-i} + \\epsilon_t\n\\end{equation}\n    \nUnpacking the formula:\n1. Natural extension of a multiple linear regression model: we forecast the variable of interest using a linear combination of past values of the variable (lagged values act as predictors).

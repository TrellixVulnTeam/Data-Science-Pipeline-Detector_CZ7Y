**Lets decompose the time series:** \n\nTime series data can exhibit a variety of patterns, and it is often helpful to split a time series into several components, each representing an underlying pattern category. When we decompose a time series into components, we usually combine the trend and cycle into a single trend-cycle component (sometimes called the trend for simplicity). Thus we think of a time series comprising three components: a trend-cycle component, a seasonal component, and a remainder component (containing anything else in the time series).\n\n**The Seasonal component:** A seasonal pattern occurs when a time series is affected by seasonal factors such as the time of the year or the day of the week. Seasonality is always of a fixed and known frequency. A time series can contain multiple superimposed seasonal periods.\n\n**The Trend component:** A trend exists when there is a long-term increase or decrease in the data. It does not have to be linear. Sometimes a trend is referred to as “changing direction” when it might go from an increasing trend to a decreasing trend.\n\n**The Cyclical component:** The cyclical component represents phenomena that happen across seasonal periods. Cyclical patterns do not have a fixed period like seasonal patterns do. The cyclical component is hard to isolate and it's often ‘left alone’ by combining it with the trend component.\n\n**The Noise component:** The noise or the random component is what remains behind when you separate out seasonality and trend from the time series. Noise is the effect of factors that you do not know, or which you cannot measure. It is the effect of the known unknowns, or the unknown unknowns.\n\nhttps://towardsdatascience.com/what-is-time-series-decomposition-and-how-does-it-work-9b67e007ae90"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Lets decompose for data of smaller size.

So, if our data mean, variance and covariance is varied with time then our data is non-stationary and we have to make it stationary before applying any method.

A time series can have components like trend, seasonality, cyclic and residual. ACF considers all these components while finding correlations hence it’s a ‘complete auto-correlation plot’.\n\n**PACF** is a partial auto-correlation function. Basically instead of finding correlations of present with lags like ACF, it finds correlation of the residuals (which remains after removing the effects which are already explained by the earlier lag(s)) with the next lag value hence ‘partial’ and not ‘complete’ as we remove already found variations before we find the next correlation. So if there is any hidden information in the residual which can be modeled by the next lag, we might get a good correlation and we will keep that next lag as a feature while modeling.

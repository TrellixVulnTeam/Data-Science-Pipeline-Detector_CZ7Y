With a strong belief in equal opportunity in education, Riiid launched an AI tutor based on deep-learning algorithms in 2017 that attracted more than one million South Korean students. This year, the company released EdNet, the world’s largest open database for AI education containing more than 100 million student interactions.\n\nIn this competition, your challenge is to create algorithms for \"Knowledge Tracing,\" the modeling of student knowledge over time. The goal is to accurately predict how students will perform on future interactions. You will pair your machine learning skills using Riiid’s EdNet data. \n\nSubmissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target."},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.074059,"end_time":"2020-12-17T09:47:54.969296","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-12-17T09:47:54.895237","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Table of Contents\n\n[**1.

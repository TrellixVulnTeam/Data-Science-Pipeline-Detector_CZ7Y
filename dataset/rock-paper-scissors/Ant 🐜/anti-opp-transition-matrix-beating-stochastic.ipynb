Then you mirror the logic, by making it see what it would have seen as an enemy. This usually means, you feed *your own last action* instead of the lastOpponentAction into the logic. Moreover, you store the opponent action as \"your own action\" in your history - but here the agent does not store this history anyway. For deterministic bots without randomness you could already get a perfect score (e.g. [Anti Statistical](https://www.kaggle.com/superant/anti-statistical)).\n\nFor a stochastic bot you may already have a tiny edge over the original, but you can make it much bigger by rotating the probability action distribution clockwise (see [Geometry of RPS](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rock-paper-scissors/discussion/210305)). Rotating is very similar to adding a random variable where one of three probabilities is zero.\n\nIn the latest version I write this on probabilities directly, rather than using complex numbers. \n\nThe rotation and the magic number which is used here before argmax is: `probs += 0.63 * np.roll(probs, 1)`. Seeing this in terms of complex number multiplication on the representations, this value is suspiciously close to \\\\(\\exp(2\\pi i \\cdot \\frac{1}{9})\\\\)\n\nSeveral interesting questions arise:\n\n* Why is the phase shift so sensitive and why is `0.63` a good value for different stochastic agents? Or can you find a better value?\n* Can you do better than a constant shift?\n* Can you use this technique without knowing the opponent's code?\n* Can you detect whether the opponent is vulnerable to such a tactics (i.e. detect if he is OTM) without trying out (inducing) this strategy?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Original Opponent Transition Matrix\n\nHere is the original [Opponent Transition Matrix](https://www.kaggle.com/group16/rps-opponent-transition-matrix): "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%writefile otm.py\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport random\n\nT = np.zeros((3, 3))\nP = np.zeros((3, 3))\n\n# a1 is the action of the opponent 1 step ago\n# a2 is the action of the opponent 2 steps ago\na1, a2 = None, None\n\ndef transition_agent(observation, configuration):\n    global T, P, a1, a2\n    if observation.step > 1:\n        a1 = observation.lastOpponentAction\n        T[a2, a1] += 1\n        P = np.divide(T, np.maximum(1, T.sum(axis=1)).reshape(-1, 1))\n        a2 = a1\n        if np.sum(P[a1, :]) == 1:\n            return int((np.random.choice(\n                [0, 1, 2],\n                p=P[a1, :]\n            ) + 1) % 3)\n        else:\n            return int(np.random.randint(3))\n    else:\n        if observation.step == 1:\n            a2 = observation.lastOpponentAction\n        return int(np.random.randint(3))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Anti Opponent Transition Matrix\n\nChanges are marked with comments.

Camera traps have infrared sensor or motion sensor, so they can detect animals. When animals come near, camera take their pictures. Using camera traps, we can monitor wildlifes continuously ,at several point and at the same time. So we can understand how animals run their life in the area researchers interest.[1]\n\nFor example, in Kaen Krachan National Park in Thailand, indian sinatra are directlly observed. So it was pointed out that there is no longer any possibility. But by using camera trap, we could confirm thir existence. [2]\n\nTraditionally, camera traps have been considered an excellent method for investigating ecological information about wildlife in a certain area.ã€€Data are used for population estimation, calculating population index, 24hours monitorling and so on.[3]\n\nResently there has been a movement to make effective use of photos from camera traps using machine learning. One of the example is [4]. Google successed to access so much wildlife photo knowledge. Following Wilflife Insights is the platform of taking the initiative.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"YouTubeVideo('qKgRbkCkRFY')","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Thus, creating a model for effectively classifying wild animals is a very significant effort.\n\n### Referece\n\n[1]https://www.wwf.org.uk/project/conservationtechnology/camera-trap\n\n[2]https://www.wwf.or.jp/campaign/2015_camera/\n\n[3]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camera_trap\n\n[4]https://www.blog.google/products/earth/ai-finds-where-the-wild-things-are/","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"2\"></a> <br>\n# <div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">Explanation for image file</div>\n\nFirst, let's take a look at what kind of images are available.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"TRAIN_DATA_PATH = '../input/iwildcam2021-fgvc8/train/'\nTEST_DATA_PATH = '../input/iwildcam2021-fgvc8/test/'\n\ntrain_jpeg = glob.glob(TRAIN_DATA_PATH + '*')\ntest_jpeg = glob.glob(TEST_DATA_PATH + '*')\n\nprint(\"number of train jpeg data:\", len(train_jpeg))\nprint(\"number of test jpeg data:\", len(test_jpeg))","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Train data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = plt.figure(figsize=(25, 16))\nfor i,im_path in enumerate(train_jpeg[:16]):\n    ax = fig.add_subplot(4, 4, i+1, xticks=[], yticks=[])\n    im = Image.open(im_path)\n    im = im.resize((480,270))\n    plt.imshow(im)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = plt.figure(figsize=(25, 16))\nfor i,im_path in enumerate(train_jpeg[16:32]):\n    ax = fig.add_subplot(4, 4, i+1, xticks=[], yticks=[])\n    im = Image.open(im_path)\n    im = im.resize((480,270))\n    plt.imshow(im)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Test data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = plt.figure(figsize=(25, 16))\nfor i,im_path in enumerate(test_jpeg[:16]):\n    ax = fig.add_subplot(4, 4, i+1, xticks=[], yticks=[])\n    im = Image.open(im_path)\n    im = im.resize((480,270))\n    plt.imshow(im)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"By camera traps, images are taken continuously because they are captured in bursts triggered by motion.

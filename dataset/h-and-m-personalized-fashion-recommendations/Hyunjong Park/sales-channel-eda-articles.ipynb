Comparison of sales by sales channel (which is 'online' and 'store).\n2. Distribution of Sales within each sales channel.\n  \n## Intro\nI have read EDAs that were shared on for this competition and there were quite a lot of useful ones that were great for starting points.  \nThey visualized and summarized the data in general so that we can understand the data easily.  \n  \nIn this notebook, however, I tried to focus on particular subject for deeper understanding of the data.  \nThe subject is about *the differences between the sales channel*.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-09T02:13:01.449631Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-09T02:13:01.45043Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-09T02:13:01.487273Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-09T02:13:01.450306Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-09T02:13:01.486056Z"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Let's first take care of the packages and settings.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport plotly.express as px\n\npd.set_option('max_columns', None)\n\ncolor = px.colors.qualitative.Pastel","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-09T06:30:38.694542Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-09T06:30:38.69539Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-09T06:30:40.196859Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-09T06:30:38.695285Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-09T06:30:40.195983Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I will first merge articles table and transactions table.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"articles = pd.read_csv('../input/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations/articles.csv')\ntransactions = pd.read_csv('../input/h-and-m-personalized-fashion-recommendations/transactions_train.csv')\n\n# To save some memory, I selected the only columns that I used.\narticles = articles[['article_id', 'product_type_name', 'product_group_name', 'graphical_appearance_name',\n          'colour_group_name', 'perceived_colour_value_name', 'perceived_colour_master_name',\n          'index_group_name', 'index_name', 'section_name', 'garment_group_name']]\ntransactions = transactions[['article_id', 't_dat', 'sales_channel_id']]\n\ncombined = transactions.merge(articles, on='article_id', how='left')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-09T06:32:43.370054Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-09T06:32:43.370324Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-09T06:33:51.576083Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-09T06:32:43.370297Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-09T06:33:51.575194Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For better readability, I will create and use 'channel' column to indicate online / store sales.","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-09T02:21:18.154378Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-09T02:21:18.154857Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-09T02:21:18.910464Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-09T02:21:18.154804Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-09T02:21:18.909241Z"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"combined['channel'] = ''\n\ncombined.loc[combined.sales_channel_id==1, 'channel'] = 'store'\ncombined.loc[combined.sales_channel_id==2, 'channel'] = 'online'","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-09T06:34:04.592845Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-09T06:34:04.593159Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-09T06:34:08.263042Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-09T06:34:04.593128Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-09T06:34:08.262136Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First, let's investigate if there are any difference in sales (by quantity) by the categories of the articles.\n\nI forced the width to be 1500 since there are quite a lot of categories in certain cases.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"groups_list = ['index_group_name', 'index_name', 'product_group_name', 'product_type_name', 'section_name', 'garment_group_name']\n\nfor group in groups_list:\n    com_g = combined[['article_id', 'channel', group]].groupby([group, \"channel\"]).count().reset_index()\n    fig = px.bar(com_g, x=group, y='article_id', color='channel', barmode='group',\n                 labels={'article_id': 'sales_quantity'}, title='Sales (Quantity) by ' + group, color_discrete_sequence=color,\n                 width=1500, height=500)\n    fig.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-09T06:34:32.449868Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-09T06:34:32.450194Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-09T06:35:34.913813Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-09T06:34:32.450158Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-09T06:35:34.912975Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Insights from these charts.\n1.

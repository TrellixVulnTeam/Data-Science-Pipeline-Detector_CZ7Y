When subsets of rows of the training data are also taken when calculating each split point, this is called random forest.\n\nThese techniques can also be used in the gradient tree boosting model in a technique called stochastic gradient boosting.\n\nIn this kernel I will be demonstrating stochastic gradient boosting and how to tune the sampling parameters using XGBoost with scikit-learn in Python.\n\nAfter reading this kernel we will get to know the following point in detail:\n\n- The rationale behind training trees on subsamples of data and how this can be used in gradient boosting.\n- How to tune row-based subsampling in XGBoost using scikit-learn?\n- How to tune column-based subsampling by both tree and split-point in XGBoost?\n\n## What is Stochastic Gradient Boosting? Let's understand the concept in detail\n\nGradient boosting is a greedy procedure.\n\nNew decision trees are added to the model to correct the residual error of the existing model.\n\nEach decision tree is created using a greedy search procedure to select split points that best minimize an objective function. This can result in trees that use the same attributes and even the same split points again and again.\n\nBagging is a technique where a collection of decision trees are created, each from a different random subset of rows from the training data. The effect is that better performance is achieved from the ensemble of trees because the randomness in the sample allows slightly different trees to be created, adding variance to the ensembled predictions.\n\nRandom forest takes this one step further, by allowing the features (columns) to be subsampled when choosing split points, adding further variance to the ensemble of trees.\n\nThese same techniques can be used in the construction of decision trees in gradient boosting in a variation called stochastic gradient boosting.\n\nIt is common to use aggressive sub-samples of the training data such as 40% to 80%.\n\n# Overview\n\nIn this kernel we are going to look at the effect of different subsampling techniques in gradient boosting.\n\nWe will tune three different flavors of stochastic gradient boosting supported by the XGBoost library in Python, specifically:\n\n**1.  Subsampling of rows in the dataset when creating each tree.**\n\n**2. Subsampling of columns in the dataset when creating each tree.**\n\n**3. Subsampling of columns for each split in the dataset when creating each tree.**\n\n## Dataset\n\nWe will use the **Otto Group Product Classification Challenge** dataset available in Kaggle which is available for free.\nThis dataset describes the 93 obfuscated details of more than 61,000 products grouped into 10 product categories (e.g. fashion, electronics, etc.). Input attributes are counts of different events of some kind.The Otto Group is one of the world’s biggest e-commerce companies, with subsidiaries in more than 20 countries, including Crate & Barrel (USA), Otto.de (Germany) and 3 Suisses (France) selling millions of products worldwide every day, with several thousand products being added to our product line.\n\n#### Data fields\n- id - an anonymous id unique to a product\n- feat_1, feat_2, ..., feat_93 - the various features of a product\n- target - the class of a product\n\n## Problem Description\n\nThe goal is to make predictions for new products as an array of probabilities for each of the 10 categories and models are evaluated using multiclass logarithmic loss (also called cross entropy).\n\n## Solution Approach\n\nAs mentioned above let us look at the appraoches one by one."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nfrom pandas import read_csv\nfrom xgboost import XGBClassifier\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\nimport matplotlib\nmatplotlib.use('Agg')\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"597d90ebbe7ec0eea2fb8009787f9ea3d1c545e5"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Load data"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = read_csv('../input/train.csv')\ndataset = data.values","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e7de12e30b46d84b3ff6135647086d1ba8893b3c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Split the data into X and y"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"8765057a6763de16ade6701c7294b6708564c108","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"X = dataset[:,0:94]\ny = dataset[:,94]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"80a0e2422d047aa20d13bb4bd6dd563045db6f7a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Encode string class values as integers"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"34f1eced577ded9e3f1576c775c89183f946891a"},"cell_type":"code","source":"label_encoded_y = LabelEncoder().fit_transform(y)\nmodel = XGBClassifier()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"aed92c566ab59a5c4bbbbc767b311e5be1731aed"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.

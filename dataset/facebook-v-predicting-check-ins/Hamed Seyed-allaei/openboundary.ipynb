I think the reason is: \n\nThe reported position of a device (x,y), \nmight be different from its true position (x_t, y_t) because of the errors. \nNow assume that the probability of having a value lesser or greater that its true value \nis equal, P(x > x_t | x_t) = P(x < x_t | x_t). \nFor any point that is far from border, we should get an almost flat density P(x) = const. \nBut on the border the story is different. \n\nIf the true position is on the border, \nand the measured position is inside the border, \nthen we see that device, but if the observed is outside of the border, \nthen we have a loss, its coordinates are not reported. \nBeyond the borders there is only void so there is nothing to compensate the loss. \nWe have lower density of checkins at the borders. \nThe density increases as we go farther.

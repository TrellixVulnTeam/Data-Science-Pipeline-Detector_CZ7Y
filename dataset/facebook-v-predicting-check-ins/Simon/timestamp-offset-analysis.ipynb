There are less check-ins at night between 21:00 and 7:00 because most people probably are asleep/at home then.\n\n## Weekly aggregate\nThe plot for the daily aggregate starts at what I think is monday. The first four days are pretty similar. They have a small peak at breakfast and dinner hour each and they have less check-ins than the other days. On thursday is a high peak at dinner hour which I can't really explain. The same is the case on friday. I think the last two days are saturday and sunday because the check-ins are more uniformly distributed over the whole day and there are also more check-ins during these days. This could be the case because people don't have to work on a weekend.

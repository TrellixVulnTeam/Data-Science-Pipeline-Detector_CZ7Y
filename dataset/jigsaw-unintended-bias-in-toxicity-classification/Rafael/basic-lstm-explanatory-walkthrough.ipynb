In plain vanilla dropout, each element is kept or dropped independently. For example, if the tensor is [2, 2, 2], each of 8 elements can be zeroed out depending on random coin flip (with certain \"heads\" probability); in total, there will be 8 independent coin flips and any number of values may become zero, from 0 to 8.\n\n> Sometimes there is a need to do more than that. For example, one may need to drop the whole slice along 0 axis. The noise_shape in this case is [1, 2, 2] and the dropout involves only 4 independent random coin flips. The first component will either be kept together or be dropped together. The number of zeroed elements can be 0, 2, 4, 6 or 8. It cannot be 1 or 5.\n\n> You may want to do this to account for adjacent pixels correlation, especially in the early convolutional layers. Effectively, you want to prevent co-adaptation of pixels with its neighbors across the feature maps, and make them learn as if no other feature maps exist.\n\nAnother simpler one from https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/38519/what-does-spatialdropout1d-do-to-output-of-embedding-in-keras:\n\n> Basically, it removes all the pixel in a row from all channels. eg: take [[1,1,1], [2,4,5]], there are 3 points with values in 2 channels, by doing SpatialDropout1D it zeros an entire row ie all attributes of a point is set to 0; like [[1,1,0], [2,4,0]]\n\n> The intuition behind this is in many cases for an image the adjacent pixels are correlated, so hiding one of them is not helping much, rather hiding entire row, that's gotta make a difference\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"If you try to look up weights parameter in Keras.Layers.Embedding documentation, you would not find it there.

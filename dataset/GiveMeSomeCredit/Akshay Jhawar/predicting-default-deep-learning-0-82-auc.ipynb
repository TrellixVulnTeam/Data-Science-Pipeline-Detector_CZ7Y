What is does help in understanding about the data that whether we have a imbalanced data. An imbalanced data is basically where the event rate is really low; in the range of 0-5%. Usually, the defaults are a rare scenarios in case of Home Loans & Auto Loans. When you have a default rate in this range, we should be able to balance the data first and then run any model on the same. To balance a data set, there are a different appraoches but the most common and the one which we will use are:\n\n* SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)\n* Near Miss (Under sampling Technique)\n\nBelow image clearly explains How Undersampling and Oversampling works:\n![Undersampling and Oversampling](https://oralytics.files.wordpress.com/2019/05/screenshot-2019-05-20-15.34.14.png?w=705)\nImage Source: https://oralytics.com/2019/07/01/managing-imbalanced-data-sets-with-smote-in-python/\n\n**SMOTE** works by selecting examples that are close in the feature space, drawing a line between the examples in the feature space and drawing a new sample at a point along that line. Specifically, a random example from the minority class is first chosen. Then k of the nearest neighbors for that example are found (typically k=5). A randomly selected neighbor is chosen and a synthetic example is created at a randomly selected point between the two examples in feature space.\n\n**NEAR MISS** is an under-sampling technique. It aims to balance class distribution by randomly eliminating majority class examples. When instances of two different classes are very close to each other, we remove the instances of the majority class to increase the spaces between the two classes. This helps in the classification process. To prevent problem of information loss in most under-sampling techniques, near-neighbor methods are widely used.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Checking for the Default rate\nAs we see that it is definitely a case of imbalanced data. So, we had to follow one of the approach discussed above; so either we will be oversampling or undersampling. There is a trade-off between having to chooses undersampling or oversampling:\n\n1. **With undersampling**, there is a big loss of data as the total number of rows will be reduced to the number of rows for event rate (Defaults). So, there is a high possibility of High Bias,\n1. **With oversampling**, there will be synthetic data added to make the Defaults observations equal to the Non-Defaults. The synthetic data is not the exact replica of the observations under Default but these are very much the same as chosen from their nearest neighbours.

In some situations GLMs will be preferred over more-sophisticated methods despite reduced predictive performance. Having explored this data, I don't think this will be the case here. I should think the lightGBM approach will be far better.\n\nLets see!"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import lightgbm as lgb\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Read the data.

I'm going to keep this simple and have one validation fold. It's better to have multiple folds but this can take a long time. People also like to average predictions over multiple folds - which works very nicely but isn't the **key** part of what is happening here.\n\nThe key point is that if tree-based models are allowed too many iterations on the data (i.e. too many trees are built), they will start fitting noise. We don't want that, so after each new tree is built using the training data we check if including that tree improves predictive accuracy on data never seen before - i.e. the validation data. If it stops improving performance, then we stop building trees..\n\nI'll keep 20% of the data back for validation."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"features=[f for f in train.columns if f not in ['id', 'target']]\nfeatures","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#train_test_split is a sklearn function for splitting your data.

As expected, this is a tangible improvement over the half-hearted GLM-attempt (0.72910) for much less effort.\n\nThere's way more to do here - there will be some simple gains to be made from hyperparameter tuning (the set we're using here is my usual starting parameters - no attempt at optimisation), and some from model ensembling. Feature engineering wins these kinds of competitions though.... my sense is the data could be a bit \"bland\" to engineer any nice features the model can't find itself - but have a go and see what you can find!\n\nNote though that even the lightGBM model here (or the model at the top of the leaderboard at the time of writing with a score of 0.69534) isn't **that** much better than using the mean (0.73495 - note that these are simple RMSE metrics and so are fairly easy to interpret). In reality you would want to consider whether the effort of maintaining a model and delivering predictions is worth the increase in performance over the mean method. You might be in a domain where each 0.001 improvement is worth Â£ms, or you might find it just isn't worth it and you should pick a different battle - either way it's important to know!"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

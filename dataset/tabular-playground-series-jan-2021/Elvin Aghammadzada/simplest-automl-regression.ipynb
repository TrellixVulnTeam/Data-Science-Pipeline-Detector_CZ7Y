AutoML makes machine learning available in a true sense, even to people with no major expertise in this field.\n\nAdvantages\nThe advantages of AutoML can be summed up in three major points:\n\nIncreases productivity by automating repetitive tasks. This enables a data scientist to focus more on the problem rather than the models.\nAutomating the ML pipeline also helps to avoid errors that might creep in manually.\nUltimately, AutoML is a step towards democratizing machine learning by making the power of ML accessible to everybody.\nH2O AutoML\nH2O’s AutoML can be used for automating the machine learning workflow, which includes automatic training and tuning of many models within a user-specified time-limit.

Doenst matter if you have absolutely no experience with kaggle competitions or if you already gained some experience in a few competitions, this tutorial should be helpful for both scenarios.**\n\n**I was very happy about this new kaggle competition series, every first day of each month a competition like this will be hosted :)**\n\n**It is very helpful for beginners, because the datasets are very friendly and nicely structured, and in this competition we dont even have any categorical features.**\n\n\n# What is going to happen in this tutorial?\n\n\n**In this tutorial we will first look at the data and then simply train a xgb regressor model.** \n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.)

It is one of the largest used AutoML libraries and is known for giving very good results. For the sake of demonstration I am going to try only for 3 model search but you can always experiement with it and train it for longer duration.\n\nThe following notebook has been inspired from various tutorials and kernels that have used H2O's AutoML to secure good ranks. Personally I found the results quite satisfactory after using this kernel conisdering the amount of work and time I had to spend to achieve that score."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## IMPORTING DEPENDENCIES"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import h2o\nfrom h2o.automl import H2OAutoML\nh2o.init()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## IMPORTING DATASET\n\n### H2O has its own way of handling datasets and we will need to import them as a file rather than reading them as a csv."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train = h2o.import_file('/kaggle/input/tabular-playground-series-jan-2021/train.csv')\ntest = h2o.import_file('/kaggle/input/tabular-playground-series-jan-2021/test.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Let us also read the csv in case we need them in later.\n\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/tabular-playground-series-jan-2021/train.csv')\ntest_df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/tabular-playground-series-jan-2021/test.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Prepare the data\n\ny = 'target'\nx = train.columns\nx.remove(y)\nx.remove('id')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# max_models can be played around with and seed as well.

One question I usually contemplate is, \"How good is best?\".  It is said that time is money, so how much time (or money) should a person spend on a task to make it “best”? Unfortunately, this can sometimes be a difficult question to answer.\n# \n# Given the above, suppose you are asked by your boss to predict thousands of outcomes from some data that is circulating around the office (think the data in the Tabular Playground Series competition!), what to do? Fortunately, your co-workers have been busy on the problem and they tell you that XGBoost on the raw data should work fine. XGBoost sounds good to you, but how much extra work would it be to use Hyperopt to make the results potentially better? Is the extra effort worth it?\n# \n# The information provided here will not provide a definitive answer to the above questions. The idea is, why not give it a go and see for yourself? Here is what I tried, starting with notebook code generously posted by:\n# \n# https://www.kaggle.com/jamesmcguigan/tabular-playground-xgboost\n# and\n# https://www.kaggle.com/marionhesse/hyperopt-xgboost-parameter-tuning\n# \n\n# As with the above notebooks, the notebooks referred to in the links below are released under the Apache 2.0 open source license. http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n# https://www.kaggle.com/nicholaskarlson/tps-apply-xgboost-to-data-jan2021\n\n# https://www.kaggle.com/nicholaskarlson/tps-hyperopt-run-jan2021"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# How good is best?

{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# The January 2021 Tabular Playground Series competition is almost over and thanks to the many people who have posted great notebooks with a lot of great ideas. One question I usually contemplate is, \"How good is best?\".  It is said that time is money, so how much time (or money) should a person spend on a task to make it “best”? Unfortunately, this can sometimes be a difficult question to answer.\n# \n# Given the above, suppose you are asked by your boss to predict thousands of outcomes from some data that is circulating around the office (think the data in the Tabular Playground Series competition!), what to do? Fortunately, your coworkers have been busy on the problem and they tell you that XGBoost on the raw data should work fine. XGBoost sounds good to you, but how much extra work would it be to use Hyperopt to make the results potentially better? Is the extra effort worth it?\n# \n# The information provided here will not provide a definitive answer to the above questions. The idea is, why not give it a go and see for yourself? Here is what I tried, starting with notebook code generously posted by:\n# \n# https://www.kaggle.com/jamesmcguigan/tabular-playground-xgboost\n# and\n# https://www.kaggle.com/marionhesse/hyperopt-xgboost-parameter-tuning\n# \n# This notebook contains the basic “apply XGBoost to data”, another notebook has the code using XGBoost with Hyperopt.\n# As with the above notebooks, this notebook is released under the Apache 2.0 open source license. http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Applying XGBoost to the data is given below.

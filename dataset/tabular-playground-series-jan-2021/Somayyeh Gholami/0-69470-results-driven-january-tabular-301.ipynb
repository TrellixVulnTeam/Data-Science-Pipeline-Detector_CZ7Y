He won the fourth place according to the private score [0.69500] and the second place according to the public score [0.69579]. Thanks for sharing the results, I also congratulate him.\n\n### https://www.kaggle.com/davidedwards1/jan21-tabular-playground-4-lb-final-blend\n\n\n### - During this challenge, I had a public notebook that improved the results of other people's kernels using the \"ensembling\" and \"Comparative Method\". The address of the previous notebook is here: \n\n### https://www.kaggle.com/somayyehgholami/results-driven-tabular-playground-series-201\n\n\n### - In this notebook, I greatly improved the private and public scores of the fourth winner. This was done using the results of a number of public notebooks that had a much worse score than the fourth winning notebook. (For example, the best score in this collection was related to my notebook: 0.69648) You can also see that the problem of \"Overfitting\" does not happen, and quite the opposite, that is, in this method, the private score is closer to what we expect.\n\n### - This method is not only for Kegel challenges but you can also use this method for your own projects. For example, suppose you have a real project (not a Kaggle challenge). You got seven mediocre results with seven simple methods and three good results with three advanced methods. You usually miss out on seven mediocre results, but my suggestion is that even mediocre results are important. You can improve good results by \"ensembling\" and use mediocre results for the \"Comparative Method\".\n\n### - The \"Comparative Method\" is new to you because it's my own idea. Of course, outside of Kaggle, I have used the \"Comparative Method\" many times, and this method has always worked very well. That's why I decided to share this method with you in this challenge. As you will see in this notebook, the positive effect of the \"Comparative Method\" is even greater than the effect of all the \"ensembling\" steps. You can also find more information about this notebook at the following address:\n\n###

Using lags and transformations on the lags generates many rows with `np.nan`s, this is a flag to indicate whether we want to drop them when we're done.\n* **keep_last_n**: keep only last `n` samples from each time serie after computing the features. The updates are performed by applying the transformations on the series again and taking only the last value.

{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In a [previous notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/chrisrichardmiles/m5-fast-lags-features) I developed some very efficient functions that can can be used to develop features based on previous sales. The great benefit of these functions is that the features are generated in such a way that all features are aligned on the same index, which makes combing features very easy later on. I added these functions to my [helper file](https://www.kaggle.com/chrisrichardmiles/m5-helpers/edit/run/35754663). This notebook will be the first in a series of notebooks where we utilize these functions to create a huge amount of lags features, broken into many pickle files. When we are done exhausting our ideas for lags features, we will try to bring them all together using PCA. \n\nWe choose to break them into many pickle files to prevent our notebooks from crashing when we are loading the data.

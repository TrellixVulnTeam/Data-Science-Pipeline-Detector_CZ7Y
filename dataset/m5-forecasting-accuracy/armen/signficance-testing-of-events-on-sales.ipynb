If we were to select non-event days as consecutive too, the results could possibly change a bit.\n   * \"Correlation doesn't mean causation\": sale of a food item can increase by Valentine's day appraoching but that might be because it's the cold February driving people to buy ingredients for their chili. But this would show as a yearly trend in the data too.\n\n   \n### Method:\n   * Extract all events from the calendar.\n   * For each event, extract the days of the event.\n   * Given a range (for example a week before) extract all days within that range for all events. (call these \"event days\"\n   * For each event, generate a random non-event set of days. \n       ** number of these days are set to be equal to the number of \"event days\".\n       ** specify a range of days around the event that cannot include non-event days (here my non-event days are at least one month away from the event itself)\n   * For each item and for each event, perform Welch's t-test and get the pvalue associated with it"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**module imports:** "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport random\nfrom scipy.stats import ttest_ind\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**reading calendar:**"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"calendar = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(dirname, \"calendar.csv\"))\ncalendar.tail(5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are only a few days where two events coincide:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"calendar[~pd.isna(calendar['event_name_1']) & ~pd.isna(calendar['event_name_2'])]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Quick look at the list of all events in the calendar:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"calendar['event_name_1'].unique()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Reading sales data:** There are ~30K rows in this dataset, but number of unique items are ~3K, that's because each item is repeated ten times (once for each store; 10 stores in total)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sales = pd.read_csv(os.path.join(dirname, \"sales_train_validation.csv\"))\nprint(sales.shape)\nprint(sales['item_id'].unique().shape)\nprint(sales['store_id'].unique().shape)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Quick look at sales table:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sales.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This function extracts a dictionary of event names mapped to their days of observation in the calendar:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def get_event_days(calendar):\n    events = {i:[] for i in np.concatenate((calendar['event_name_1'].unique(), calendar['event_name_2'].unique())) if not pd.isna(i)}\n    for event in events.keys():\n        event_days = calendar.iloc[np.where((calendar['event_name_1'] == event) | (calendar['event_name_2'] == event))]['d'].tolist()\n        events[event] = event_days\n    return events","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"events = get_event_days(calendar)\nprint(events['SuperBowl'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This function extends the list of days of observance for each event to a range.

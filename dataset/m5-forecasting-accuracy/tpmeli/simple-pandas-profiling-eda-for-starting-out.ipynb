I will be doing a more intensive exploratory data analysis soon, but this is just a simple bare bones kernel with processed pandas profiling reports of each of the datasets.  \n\nThese can take a very long time to process, so having them handy is very useful.\n\nAfter checking out the data here, feel free to check out me [my EDA kernel here](https://www.kaggle.com/tpmeli/seasonal-decomposition-question-based-eda-of-m5)\n\n### Use the 'toggle details' to see more.  You can also download the html reports yourself with the html links above the report.###"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom pandas_profiling import ProfileReport\nfrom IPython.display import HTML\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# train_sales = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/m5-forecasting-accuracy/sales_train_validation.csv')\n# sell_prices = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/m5-forecasting-accuracy/sell_prices.csv')\n# calendar = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/m5-forecasting-accuracy/calendar.csv')\n# submission_file = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/m5-forecasting-accuracy/sample_submission.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#train_report = ProfileReport(train_sales, title='Sales Train Validation Profiling Report')\n#train_report.to_file(output_file=\"train_report.html\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Sell Prices Report ##"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"HTML(filename='/kaggle/input/m5-pandas-profiles-of-sell-prices-calendar/sell_prices_report.html')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#sell_prices_report = ProfileReport(sell_prices, title='Sell Prices Profiling Report')\n#sell_prices_report.to_file(output_file=\"sell_prices_report.html\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Calendar Report ##"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"HTML(filename='/kaggle/input/m5-pandas-profiles-of-sell-prices-calendar/calendar_report.html')\n\n#calendar_report = ProfileReport(calendar, title='Calendar Profiling Report')\n#calendar_report.to_file(output_file=\"calendar_report.html\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Train Validation Report - Too Big 218 MB...##\n* If someone has a tip for how to display such a big html file, would you let me know?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**What's coming next...**\n\n* I'm planning on doing a full EDA and publishing that publically here.\n* I'm going to merge the information from these datasets and do another pandas report.\n* I'll publish an unsupervised exploration of these datasets.\n\nThanks for reading!

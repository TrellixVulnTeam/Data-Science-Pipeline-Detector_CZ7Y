The chip has been specifically designed for Google's TensorFlow framework, a symbolic math library which is used for machine learning applications such as neural networks. However, as of 2017 Google still used CPUs and GPUs for other types of machine learning. Other AI accelerator designs are appearing from other vendors also and are aimed at embedded and robotics markets.\n\n\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import YouTubeVideo\nYouTubeVideo('zEOtG-ChmZE', width=800, height=400)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Why use a TPU ?\n\nTensor Processing Unit is highly-optimised for large batches and CNNs and has the highest training throughput , it can decrease your training time\n![Image](https://wideops.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Google_Cloud_TPU_v3_Pod_speed-ups_sCUcjjC.max-1000x1000.png)\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Some Great Kernels Demonstrating The Power Of TPU  üî•\n\n- [Incredible TPUs - finetune EffNetB0-B6 at once](https://www.kaggle.com/agentauers/incredible-tpus-finetune-effnetb0-b6-at-once)\n\n- [Super-duper fast pytorch tpu kernel... üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•](https://www.kaggle.com/abhishek/super-duper-fast-pytorch-tpu-kernel)\n\n- [Accelerator Power Hour (PyTorch + TPU)](https://www.kaggle.com/abhishek/accelerator-power-hour-pytorch-tpu)\n\n- [[TPU-Inference] Super Fast XLMRoberta](https://www.kaggle.com/shonenkov/tpu-inference-super-fast-xlmroberta)\n\n- [Triple Stratified KFold with TFRecords](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/triple-stratified-kfold-with-tfrecords)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers [BERT]  \n\nBidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers is a technique for NLP pre-training developed by Google. BERT was created and published in 2018 by Jacob Devlin and his colleagues from Google. Google is leveraging BERT to better understand user searches.\n\nWhen BERT was published, it achieved state-of-the-art performance on a number of natural language understanding tasks:\n\nGLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation) task set (consisting of 9 tasks)\nSQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) v1.1 and v2.0.\nSWAG (Situations With Adversarial Generations)\n\nThe reasons for BERT's state-of-the-art performance on these natural language understanding tasks are not yet well understood. Current research has focused on investigating the relationship behind BERT's output as a result of carefully chosen input sequences, analysis of internal vector representations through probing classifiers, and the relationships represented by attention weights.\n\napproiate model for the given problem - bert-base-multilingual-cased\n\n* You should pick a ‚Äúcased‚Äù model or an ‚Äúuncased‚Äù model depending on whether you think letter casing will be helpful for the task you‚Äôre trying to solve.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Different Refined Versions Of BERT \n\n[Here's A list of pretrained different model options from ü§ó](https://huggingface.co/transformers/pretrained_models.html)\n\n# Top  Contenders For The GIven Problem\n\n### 1) XLM-RoBERTa\n\nThe XLM-RoBERTa model was proposed in Unsupervised Cross-lingual Representation Learning at Scale by Alexis Conneau, Kartikay Khandelwal, Naman Goyal, Vishrav Chaudhary, Guillaume Wenzek, Francisco Guzm√°n, Edouard Grave, Myle Ott, Luke Zettlemoyer and Veselin Stoyanov. It is based on Facebook‚Äôs RoBERTa model released in 2019. It is a large multi-lingual language model, trained on 2.5TB of filtered CommonCrawl data.\n\n\n### 2) DistilBERT\n\nThe DistilBERT model was proposed in the blog post Smaller, faster, cheaper, lighter: Introducing DistilBERT, a distilled version of BERT, and the paper DistilBERT, a distilled version of BERT: smaller, faster, cheaper and lighter. DistilBERT is a small, fast, cheap and light Transformer model trained by distilling Bert base. It has 40% less parameters than bert-base-uncased, runs 60% faster while preserving over 95% of Bert‚Äôs performances as measured on the GLUE language understanding benchmark.\n\n\n### 3) XLM \n\nThe XLM model was proposed in Cross-lingual Language Model Pretraining by Guillaume Lample*, Alexis Conneau*. It‚Äôs a transformer pre-trained using one of the following objectives:\n\n-a causal language modeling (CLM) objective (next token prediction),\n\n-a masked language modeling (MLM) objective (Bert-like), or\n\n-a Translation Language Modeling (TLM) object (extension of Bert‚Äôs MLM to multiple language inputs)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Lets Get Started - Loading Libraries And Data \n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import tensorflow as tf\nimport os\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport transformers \nfrom transformers import TFAutoModel, AutoTokenizer\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Input\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Model\nfrom tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam\nimport pandas as pd \nimport numpy as np \nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_data_frame=pd.read_csv(\"../input/contradictory-my-dear-watson/train.csv\")\ntest_data_frame =pd.read_csv(\"../input/contradictory-my-dear-watson/test.csv\")\nsample_sub=pd.read_csv(\"../input/contradictory-my-dear-watson/sample_submission.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Initialise TPU | Distribution strategies | TPU Configuration\nMost times users want to run the model on multiple TPUs in a data parallel way.

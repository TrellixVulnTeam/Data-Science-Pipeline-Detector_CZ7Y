Moreover, the execution time will be less when compared to ThreadPoolExecution. Consider the following Python script example to understand this.\n\n\n* I/O bound refers to a condition in which the time it takes to complete a computation is determined principally by the period spent waiting for input/output operations to be completed\n\n* In computer science, a computer is CPU-bound (or compute-bound) when the time for it to complete a task is determined principally by the speed of the central processor: processor utilization is high, perhaps at 100% usage for many seconds or minutes.\\\n\nLINK-https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **NOW WE ARE READY TO LEARN FUTURES**\n\n**Start Dask Client** -You must start a Client to use the futures interface.

After Dask generates these task graphs, it needs to execute them on parallel hardware. This is the job of a task scheduler. Different task schedulers exist, and each will consume a task graph and compute the same result, but with different performance characteristics.\n\n![](http://docs.dask.org/en/latest/_images/collections-schedulers.png)\n\n\n\nDask has two families of task schedulers:\n\n* Single machine scheduler:  This scheduler provides basic features on a local process or thread pool. This scheduler was made first and is the    default. It is simple and cheap to use, although it can only be used on a single machine and does not scale.\n\n* Distributed scheduler:This scheduler is more sophisticated, offers more features, but also requires a bit more effort to set up. It can run locally or distributed across a cluster.\n\n\n**NOW THE QUESTION IS THAT WHICH ONE TO USE AND WHEN**\n\nSome criterias are as follows:\n\n* Local Threads\n* Local Processes\n* Single Thread\n* Dask Distributed (local)\n* Dask Distributed (Cluster) LINK- https://distributed.dask.org/en/latest/\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Local Threads :**\n\nThe threaded scheduler executes computations with a local multiprocessing.pool.ThreadPool. It is lightweight and requires no setup. It introduces very little task overhead (around 50us per task) and, because everything occurs in the same process, it incurs no costs to transfer data between tasks. However, due to Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), this scheduler only provides parallelism when your computation is dominated by non-Python code, as is primarily the case when operating on numeric data in NumPy arrays, Pandas DataFrames, or using any of the other C/C++/Cython based projects in the ecosystem.\n\nThe threaded scheduler is the default choice for Dask Array, Dask DataFrame, and Dask Delayed.

First, the input text data will be fed into the BERT model (after they have been converted into tokens), which in turn outputs embbeddings of the words. The advantage to other types of embeddings is that the BERT embeddings are contextualized (the word \"stick\" in the sentence \"Let's stick to the BERT model\" would have a different numerical representation than the word \"stick\" in the sentence \"Please don't throw that stick into the river\" because the context in which the word appears is different in both sentences (I got the idea for this example from [here](http://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-bert/) which is a great explanation on how BERTs work and will definitely help to understand this tutorial better as well)). Predictions with contextualized embeddings are more accurate than with non-contextualized embeddings.**\n\n**The fact that the embeddings are contextualized comes from the first (of two) parts of BERT'S training: Instead of parsing the text from left to right (or right to left), BERT takes the whole text in at once (that's why it's also called a bi-directional model, although no-directional would actually fit better) which helps it to put every word into a relation to the other words in the sentence.**\n\n**After we receive the embeddings for the words in our text from BERT, we can input them into the classifier which will then in turn return the prediction labels 0,1, or 2.**--\n\nTo start out, we can use a pretrained model.

We also need to pad all of the inputs to be the same size. For more information about BERT inputs, see: https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/bert.html#tfbertmodel\n\n--**edits by [@Katharina Menz](https://www.kaggle.com/katharinamenz): Let's break this down a little more:**\n\n**To prepare our token IDs which we received through our function encode_sentence() to become input into BERT, we first concatenate the token ID list of each sentence in the hypothesis and premise column (remember that each sentence is already separated by the [SEP] token at the end which we added above) into one list and add another token ID at the very beginning (the ID for the token '[CLS]') which denotes the beginning. However, the output list of encode_sentence() will have a different length for each sentence from our data set which means we can't just construct a nice table out of all those concatenated lists to feed them to BERT. Instead, we will have to add zeros at the end of each ID list until it has the length of the longest list in the data set (corresponding to the longest hypothesis/premise pair). This process is called padding. This way, every ID list will have the same length and BERT will be able to accept them as input. This will be the variable \"input word IDs\" mentioned above and our first input variable for the BERT model.**\n\n**However, we also need to tell BERT which of the IDs in the \"input word IDs\" actually belong to tokens that it should embed and which of them it should ignore because they are just padding. This is where input masks come into play: The input mask variable has the same size as the input word IDs variable but contains a 1 for each entry that is an actual token ID (which BERT should consider) and a 0 for eacht entry that is just padding and which BERT should ignore. This will be our second input argument \"input masks\" for the BERT model.**\n\n**Lastly, BERT also needs to know which of the input word IDs belong to which sentence (i.e., hypthesis or premise). We can explain this to BERT by using the variable 'input type IDs' mentioned above. Again, this variable has the same size as as the input word IDs variable but this time it contains a 1 for each entry that belongs to sentence B (i.e., the premise) and a 0 for each entry that belongs to sentence A (i.e., the hypothesis), including our start token ID for '[CLS]'. \"Input type IDs\" will be our third and last input argument for BERT.**--\n\nNow, we're going to encode all of our premise/hypothesis pairs for input into BERT."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"dedb18d0-63cb-492b-8fe0-b4ebb8819e4c","_cell_guid":"037b0a29-3e6d-42b6-b13a-328fab19d15d","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def bert_encode(hypotheses, premises, tokenizer):\n    \n  num_examples = len(hypotheses)\n  \n  sentence1 = tf.ragged.constant([   # KM: constructs a constant ragged tensor. every entry has a different length\n      encode_sentence(s)\n      for s in np.array(hypotheses)])\n  sentence2 = tf.ragged.constant([\n      encode_sentence(s)\n       for s in np.array(premises)])\n\n  cls = [tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(['[CLS]'])]*sentence1.shape[0] # KM: list of IDs for the token '[CLS]' to denote each beginning\n  input_word_ids = tf.concat([cls, sentence1, sentence2], axis=-1) # KM: put everything together. every row still has a different length.\n\n  input_mask = tf.ones_like(input_word_ids).to_tensor() # KM: first, a tensor with just ones in it is constructed in the same size as input_word_ids.

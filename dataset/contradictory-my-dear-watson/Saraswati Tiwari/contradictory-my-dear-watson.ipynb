To make things more interesting, the train and test set.\n\n#### Why are you trying it?\nIn this Competition, I wanna classify pairs of sentences (consisting of a premise and a hypothesis) into three categories - entailment, contradiction, or neutral.\n\nThere are three hypotheses :-\n\nHypothesis 1:\nJust by the look on his face when he came through the door I just knew that he was let down.\n\n**We know that this is true based on the information in the premise. So, this pair is related by *entailment*.**\n\nHypothesis 2:\nHe was trying not to make us feel guilty but we knew we had caused him trouble.\n\n**This very well might be true, but we can’t conclude this based on the information in the premise. So, this relationship is *neutral*.**\n\nHypothesis 3:\nHe was so excited and bursting with joy that he practically knocked the door off it's frame.\n\n**We know this isn’t true, because it is the complete opposite of what the premise says. So, this pair is related by *contradiction*.**\n\n### Special thanks to Tensorflow Datasets (TFDS) for providing this and many other useful datasets! \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np #

The most common approaches to NLI problems include using embeddings and transformers like BERT. In this competition, Kaggle provids a starter notebook to try our hand at this problem using the power of Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Yes, it works because of the TPUs, TPUs are powerful hardware accelerators specialized in deep learning tasks, including Natural Language Processing. \n\n#### What did you not understand about this process?\nWell, everything provides in the competition data page. I've no problem while working on it. If you guys don't understand the thing that I'll do in this notebook then please comment on this notebook. \n\n#### What else do you think you can try as part of this approach?\nWell, everything is in its place. If I feel like i need to add something to it then i'll definitely do this.\n\n\n\n\n\n### PLEASE UPVOTE if you like this notebook. It will keep me motivated to update my notebook. :)","metadata":{}}]}

It would however be interesting to know if this removal did actually improve the score.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"removed_pq_parts = 0\n\ndef remove_pq(InChI, debug=False):\n    global removed_pq_parts\n    \n    InChI_Original = InChI\n    # P\n    substr_p = re.findall('(?<=\\/p)[^\\/]*', InChI)\n    if len(substr_p) > 0:\n        for substr in substr_p:\n            removed_pq_parts += 1\n            InChI = InChI.replace(f'/p{substr}', '')\n    # Q\n    substr_q = re.findall('(?<=\\/q)[^\\/]*', InChI)\n    if len(substr_q) > 0:\n        for substr in substr_q:\n            removed_pq_parts += 1\n            InChI = InChI.replace(f'/q{substr}', '')\n            \n    if debug and (len(substr_p) > 0 or len(substr_q) > 0):\n        print('=' * 50)\n        print(InChI_Original)\n        print(InChI)\n        print('=' * 50)\n        \n    return InChI","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-04T08:20:39.204642Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-04T08:20:39.204985Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-04T08:20:39.212354Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-04T08:20:39.204957Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-04T08:20:39.211314Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Remove /p and /q parts as they are not present in the training set\nsubmission_final['InChI'] = submission_final['InChI'].progress_apply(remove_pq)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-04T08:20:40.215173Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-04T08:20:40.215543Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-04T08:21:02.663201Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-04T08:20:40.21551Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-04T08:21:02.662351Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Show statistics about /p /q removal\nprint(f'Total number of removed parts: {removed_pq_parts}')\nremoved_pq_parts_percentage = removed_pq_parts / len(submission_final) * 100\nprint(f'Mean percentage of InChI\\'s with /p or /q part removed: {removed_pq_parts_percentage:.3f}%')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-04T08:21:37.253735Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-04T08:21:37.254082Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-04T08:21:37.259027Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-04T08:21:37.254054Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-04T08:21:37.258132Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Submission to CSV","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Show submission head\ndisplay(submission_final.head())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-04T08:21:37.745504Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-04T08:21:37.745838Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-04T08:21:37.757485Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-04T08:21:37.745809Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-04T08:21:37.756433Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check if there are 1616107 rows!!!\ndisplay(submission_final.info())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-04T08:21:38.042844Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-04T08:21:38.043194Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-04T08:21:38.218348Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-04T08:21:38.043166Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-04T08:21:38.217618Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# write submission file to CSV\nsubmission_final.to_csv('submission.csv', index=True)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-04T08:21:40.331438Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-04T08:21:40.331769Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-04T08:21:49.128353Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-04T08:21:40.331742Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-04T08:21:49.127392Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}

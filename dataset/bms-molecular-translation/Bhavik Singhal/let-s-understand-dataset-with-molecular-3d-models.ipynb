You may have learned the structural formulae of simple molecules in school, but in this competition, relatively complex structural formulae will be introduced. Especially since data is given in the form of an image, we may feel free to use standard data augmentation methods like flip, but since molecules are essentially three-dimensional structures, there are pitfalls. To help our understand the characteristics of the data more effectively, we will use 3D model of a molecules to illustrate how to read the given image data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"2\"></a> <br>\n# <div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">Why we check 3D model?</div> \n\n- Even if we are not familiar with chemical notation, it is easy to understand molecules. \n\nSome elements may be omitted in the skeletal stractual formula, so the molecule you imagine may not be actual. For example, hydrogen bonded to carbon may be omitted, but you can see them in the 3D model (3D models often show almost all of them).\n\n- We can develop intuition for molecular structures and aplly them to ML. \n\nItuition for molecular structures is important for this machine learning theme. For examle, if you do data augmentation, you may end up with different molecules ( see [Points to note for data augmentation with flip](#6) ) by inverting the images blindly. On the other hand, we can also come up with ideas for data augmentation methods that are unique to molecular structural expressions. For example, we can change the angle from which you look at molecules. Also, if you know how to write structural expressions, you may be able to generate images with various structural expressions from InChI(This may be too difficult). In short, rotating the 3D model around is essentially equal to data augmentation.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"3\"></a> <br>\n# <div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">About Structual fomula</div> \n\nMolecules are made up of atoms bonded together.

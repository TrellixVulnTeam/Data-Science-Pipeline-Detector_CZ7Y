From August 2014, there appears to be no StateHoliday at all, which is highly unlikely, most likely it is the case of \"missing data\". That can be fixed by filling the values using previous years StateHolidays, as StateHolidays rarely change.\n\n### School Holidays\nSchoolHolidays appears to be seasonal, with July-August being the highest, may be July-August is the summer vacation time. Interesting observation is that there are minimal/least school holidays in November i.e. before Christmas vacation. Another observation is the decreasing trend of school holidays reaching a minimum point just before the vacation starts. And on the other hand, after the vacation when the school restarts there is a increasing trend of school holidays with an abrupt drop after which the decreasing trend takes on.  This abrupt drop might be the school restart after a mid-term break.\n\n### Promotions\nWhen you look at the number of promotions being held, it appears that every month there were promotions at various stores. An interesting observation is that there is a massive drop in sales/customers in January, 2014 and there were no promotions subsequent to these drop in numbers which clearly suggests that the management were unable to predict this drop in numbers. If they had predicted the drop they would have organised more promotions to lure in the customers. This is evident from the January, 2015 , where they have organised more promotions in January, 2015 learning from their mistakes from 2014. Subsequently, there appears to be more sales, albeit small change compared to Jan-Feb 2014, with same number of customers. They have organised more promotions during School holidays but it has not had much positive impact on sales or customer numbers. Again, another interesting observation is sales always has an increasing uptrend during the days when the schools are in session. Either kids are falling sick very often during School sessions or many more stores are open during school sessions?\n\n\n### which stores are high/low performers?\n### what days of the week do stores experience high/low traffic? what was different about those days?"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"298777ef-bd53-5d9f-15c9-349e6246971b"},"outputs":[],"source":"# group sales/customer data by weekday\nday = train[(train['Open']!=0)]\nsales_day = day.groupby('DayOfWeek')['Sales'].median()\ncust_day = day.groupby('DayOfWeek')['Customers'].median()\n#\nfig, (axis1) = plt.subplots(1,1, sharex=True, figsize=(10,5))\n# plot median sales\nax1 = sales_day.plot(legend=True, ax=axis1, marker='o',title=\"Median\")\nax1.set_xticks(sales_day.index)\ntmp = ax1.set_xticklabels(sales_day.index.tolist(), rotation=90)\n# overlay customer data\ncust_day.plot(legend=True, ax=axis1, marker='x', secondary_y=True)"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"986bb46b-9dc0-a851-0f88-f7a330826f6d"},"source":"That is a very interesting plot.

On Saturday, both the number of sales and customers drop to the lowest and spike again on Sunday. However, only on Sunday there is an opposite behaviour i.e. more customers are ringing in less sales, in other words there is more customer traffic but less sales. There is only one conclusion from this plot, the customers who walk into the store during the week are serious customers who will most likely make a sale whereas customers walking in on Sunday appear to be distracted/disinterested/window-shopping!

Each store is represented by its median sales and customers and the auora around each store is the extent of its mean-absolute-deviation.  The plot suggests that the sales and customers have a linear relationship i.e. increasing customer numbers will increase sales and vice-versa. A few stores have high-traffic, e.g.: 817, 1114, 733, 262 and 562. Majority of the stores appear to be on the lower end of the customer scale. \n\nHow do we determine the performance of a store? A fairly straightforward approach is via profits .i.e. higher the profits, better the performance. Profits are directly related to sales, therefore more sales will result in more profits. What are sales dependent on? Customers. Therefore, logically more customers visiting a store should result in more sales. But the real world does not work that way. Lots of customers just browse or window-shop and not contribute to sale. Therefore, in my opinion, the best performance measure for a store should be **sales per customer** or ratio of sales to customer. For example, if 10 customers spend a total of $\\$$10, then sale to customers ratio is $\\$$1 per customer. If you increase this ratio, then the store's profit will increase as a result and vice versa. Therefore, if you somehow manage to increase from $\\$$1 per customer to $\\$$2 per customer, or increase the customer numbers at the $\\$$1 per customer, your store's profitability also increases.

In my opinion, characteristics such as Promo, StoreType, Assortment and CompetitionDistance might have a part to play in contributing to a store being a high/low performer.\n\n### Effect of StoreType & Assortment on stores performance:"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"363387a5-4707-d335-15f8-ac72f990f7ca"},"outputs":[],"source":"# load stores.csv\nstores = pd.read_csv('../input/store.csv')\n# merge previous stores data with new stores data\nstores_update = stores.merge(df, how='outer', on='Store')\n\n# extract stores-data for all three categories of performers\n#high_performers = stores[stores['Store'].isin(high_stores)]\n#low_stores = df[df['Annotation'] == 'l']['Store']\n#low_performers = stores[stores['Store'].isin(low_stores)]\n#normal_stores = df[df['Annotation'] == 'n']['Store']\n#normal_performers = stores[stores['Store'].isin(normal_stores)]\n\n# Storetype - distribution (normalised histograms) across High, Low and Normal performers \n#(creating histograms of category using another category as bins (not numeric) is a bit problematic so a long-winded approach)\n# refer: http://themrmax.github.io/2015/11/13/grouped-histograms-for-categorical-data-in-pandas.html\nstoretype = stores_update.groupby('Annotation')['StoreType'].value_counts().sort_index()\ns = storetype.unstack()\ns[s.isnull()]=0\n# for each annotation calculate normalised value_counts\nfor st in s.index:\n    s.ix[st]  = s.ix[st]/s.ix[st].sum()\n    \ns[s.isnull()]=0  # convert all NAN to ZERO  \nstoretype = s\n\n\n# Assortment - distribution (normalised histogram) across High, Low and Normal performers\nassort = stores_update.groupby('Annotation')['Assortment'].value_counts().sort_index()\ns = assort.unstack()\ns[s.isnull()]=0\n# for each annotation calculate normalised value_counts\nfor st in s.index:\n    s.ix[st]  = s.ix[st]/s.ix[st].sum()\ns[s.isnull()]=0  # convert all NAN to ZERO  \nassort = s\n\n# plot\nsns.set(font_scale=1)\nfig, (axis1, axis2) = plt.subplots(1,2, figsize=(14,5))\nax = storetype.plot(kind='bar', rot=45, ax=axis1)\ntmp = ax.set_xticklabels(['High performers', 'Low performers', 'Normal performers'])\ntmp = ax.set_title('Store types distribution for High, Low and Normal performing stores')\nax1 = assort.plot(kind='bar', rot=45, ax=axis2)\ntmp = ax1.set_xticklabels(['High performers', 'Low performers', 'Normal performers'])\ntmp = ax1.set_title('Assortment distribution for High, Low and Normal performing stores')"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"edcba1fe-4b05-c35a-97d6-c2dab2cce850"},"source":"Looking at the plots above, we can compare the different characteristics of High, Low and Normal performing stores. When you consider Low performing stores in comparison with other two, there are two important distinctions. Low performing stores do not have StoreType = \"d\" but have StoreType = \"b\" and are the only stores that stock Assortment = \"b\" along with the other two types of Assortments. High performing stores on the other hand are all StoreType = \"d\" and stock only Assortment = \"c\". This is a clear indication that StoreType = \"d\" stocking Assortment = \"c\" correlates to acheiving high performance. And StoreType = \"b\" and Assortment = \"b\" appear to have negative correlation to acheiving high performance.  May be the lack of StoreType = \"b\" and Assortment = \"b\" has pushed stores to Normal performance.\n\n### Effect of Competition Distance on stores performance"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"4adc1fde-b9ee-35f2-15ac-88408edf3b43"},"outputs":[],"source":"# Competition Distance - across High, Low and Normal performers\ncompdist = stores_update.groupby('Annotation')['CompetitionDistance'].median()\n# plot\nsns.set(font_scale=1.5)\nfig, (axis1) = plt.subplots(1,1, figsize=(10,5))\nax = compdist.plot(kind='bar', rot=45, ax=axis1)\ntmp = ax.set_xticklabels(['High performers', 'Low performers', 'Normal performers'])\ntmp = ax.set_title('Competition Distance for High, Low and Normal performing stores')"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"6a6a787a-5f55-84de-ad0e-80ab02d56fb5"},"source":"High performing stores have little competition nearby where as on the other hand low performing stores have competition very nearby. \n\nTherefore, a combination of factors including StoreType, Assortment and CompetitionDistance have contributed to certain stores being low performers. I have not explored the impact on ComptetionOpenSince and Promo2 factors on stores performance and sales performance in general.\n\n### Plan of action:\nIn my opinion, general plan of action to improve sales and customer traffic will obviously help. However more nuanced approach is required, addressing shortcomings of these three categories of performers individually will deliver a big boost to sales numbers. In particular,\n\n* **High Performers**: Customers numbers are less, create campaigns and promotions to drive up customer numbers. Importance should be given to increase customer traffic via other means instead of directly offering discounts. Do not make drastic changes to StoreType or Assortments\n* **Low Performers**: Sales per customers is very less compared to customer traffic. Lots of customers are visiting but very few are ringing sales therefore targeted campaigns and promotions must be devised that entice the visiting customers to make a sale. Importance should be given to increasing sales via offering discounts and pricing competitively with nearby competition in mind. Make changes to StoreType and Assortment, customer traffice might be a floating population and you need to keep fiddling with StoreType and Assortment to entice customers.\n* **Normal Performers**: A combination of strategies being used to improve high and low performing stores should be employed here albeit at a very slower or less accelerated pace.\n\n\nIn conclusion to whether competition distance have an effect on performance of a store, my answer is, yes and I have showcased the same above. My analysis is in stark contrast to [Christian Thiele's](https://www.kaggle.com/thie1e/rossmann-store-sales/exploratory-analysis-rossmann) where he states: \n\n> _The effect of the distance to the next competitor is counterintuitive. Lower distance to the next competitor implies (slightly, possibly not significantly) higher sales._\n\n\n\nIn his work, although it is not explicitly stated, considers sales as a direct performance measure of a store. In my work I consider sales per customer as a performance measure and clearly shows the impact on sales per customer when a competition exists nearby.\n\n\n\n### What was the impact on  store's performance when competiting stores opened nearby?\n\nThe impact of competition opening nearby would be seen in the stores performance in and around the competition opening dates. Competition opening data has resolution of month therefore we will have to look at preceeding and succeeding months sales/customers data along with the actual month the competition opened to determine its impact.\n\n"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7b89b48d-85a3-d9e6-f63c-101768d9889c"},"outputs":[],"source":"# year and month when the competition opened\nyear = stores_update['CompetitionOpenSinceYear']\nmonth = stores_update['CompetitionOpenSinceMonth']\n\n# there are many NANs, remove them\nstores_notnull = year.notnull() & month.notnull()\nst = stores_update[stores_notnull]['Store']\nstores_update['CompOpen'] = stores_update[stores_notnull]['CompetitionOpenSinceYear'].astype(int).astype(str).str.cat(stores_update[stores_notnull]['CompetitionOpenSinceMonth'].astype(int).astype(str).str.zfill(2), sep='-')\n\n# extract data for stores with data for competition start dates\nstores_withdata = train[train['Store'].isin(st)]\nsubs =[]\nsubs = stores_withdata[stores_withdata['Open'] != 0] #

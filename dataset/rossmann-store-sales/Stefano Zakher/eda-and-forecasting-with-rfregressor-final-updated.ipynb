competitionn distance the more sales per customer we do, which makes sense , the further our competition, the more monopolization Rossman can achieve in the region.\n- Additionally, the effect of promo2 to Sales per Customer like we said above as well(0.22), it  did provoke a change in the buying pattern and increased it when continuous promotion were applied.\n- Finally, we can see that StoreType does play a major role with Sales per Customer (0.44), this is probably due to my encoding of the store type variable which suggests that the high categories like d which is equal 4 has higher weight, but if not then it makes sense that the last categories like d does explain the increase in Sales per Customer like fig 1.6

advantages:**\n    \n- Random forest runtimes are quite fast, and they are able to deal with unbalanced and missing data.\n- The process of averaging or combining the results of different decision trees helps to overcome the problem of overfitting.\n- They also do not require preparation of the input data. You do not have to scale the data.\n\n**Its Disadvantages:**\n- The main drawback of Random Forests is the model size. You could easily end up with a forest that takes hundreds of megabytes of memory and is slow to evaluate.\n- They get a bit harder to interpret than regular deicison trees, since we are constructing of forest of more than 50 decision trees and more using grid search.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ad9a612d1e74a0cc3ce6270237dfd46738d1b14a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Further Feature Engineering before Training:**"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"70babb11109a30f127b2c800ff98de7f57739c0b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"-Since the competition variables `CompetitionOpenSinceYear` and `CompeitionOpenSinceMonth` have the same underlying meaning, merging them into one variable that we call `CompetitionOpenSince` makes easier for the algorithm to understand the pattern and creates less branches and thus complex trees."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"7d80d566520e032defe60174c5e3066bf1640790"},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_train_store.columns","execution_count":59,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"8d791008f1b79ece73e8d54f5d687707faa88f12"},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_train_store['CompetitionOpenSince'] = np.where((df_train_store['CompetitionOpenSinceMonth']==0) & (df_train_store['CompetitionOpenSinceYear']==0) , 0,(df_train_store.Month - df_train_store.CompetitionOpenSinceMonth) + \n                                       (12 * (df_train_store.Year - df_train_store.CompetitionOpenSinceYear)) )","execution_count":60,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"8bd711c154e2ebf7c4d0864e5870f576d5e7f308"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#now that CompetitionOpenSince is created \n#we can get rid of `CompetitionOpenSinceYear` and `CompeitionOpenSinceMonth`\ndel df_train_store['CompetitionOpenSinceYear']\ndel df_train_store['CompetitionOpenSinceMonth']\n","execution_count":61,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a5518a4f54d0b91ad703da343bf842524f492b00"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"-The `StateHoliday` is not very important to distinguish (what type of holiday) and can be merged in a binary variable called `is_holiday_state`."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"00a9526a454be95cbd35721b8431bab1c1d3639b"},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_train_store[\"is_holiday_state\"] = df_train_store['StateHoliday'].map({\"0\": 0, \"a\": 1, \"b\": 1, \"c\": 1})","execution_count":62,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true,"_uuid":"1092155c7941db61e9fe8c404ce3d031f6a69dd3"},"cell_type":"code","source":"del df_train_store['StateHoliday_cat']","execution_count":63,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"78b5d989781f330dc3f3bd38eb9b1394bcdaf65e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"-I think it's always better when working with decision tree based models to have dummy variables instead of categorical with different levels, because this alters the bias of the algorithm who will favor a higher weight to the categories like 4 and deprioritize levels like 1.

understand from this project the flexibility and robustness of a decision tree based model like RandomForest which helped us predict the Store Sales of Rossman based on attributes that defines each store and its surroundings.\n- As we can see, it always delivers a good predicition score while not having a lot of modifications and difficulties capturing the patterns hidden in the data. Fortunately we had a train set that was large enough for it to converge but in general RandomForest performs not so bad on small sets since its resampling method (bagging) and its random production of trees allow the bias to remain not so high and in this case always performs good on unseen data where as XGboost has tendency to overfit if not gently and smartly tuned.\n- I believe using hyperparameter optimization techniques like Gridsearch and RandomizedSearch is crucial to any Machine Learning problem since it allows the algorithm to not just limit itself on its defaulted parameters but to discover new opportunities of combining those parameters to reach a local optima while training on the data."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7e53b973261b490fc09484e6b5303b35347c6024"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Thank you again for taking the time to go through my work! i hope you enjoyed!\n\nFor the full version please check my \n\nGitHub:\nhttps://github.com/stefanozakher/Kaggle_Rossman_Sales_Predicitions/blob/master/Rossman%20Sales%20Prediciton%20_%20Stefano%20Zakher.ipynb"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a5886d858f2d02389c898feac5cbff36337c1968"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Please leave an upvote if you think this was benefitial for your understanding of the problem and follow me for more exciting projects upcoming!"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.4"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

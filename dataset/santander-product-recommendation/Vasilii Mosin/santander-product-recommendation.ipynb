The data starts at 2015-01-28 and has monthly records of products a customer has, such as \"credit card\", \"savings account\", etc. The goal is to predict what additional products a customer will get in the last month, 2016-06-28, in addition to what they already have at 2016-05-28. These products are the columns named: ind_(xyz)_ult1, which are the columns #25 - #48 in the training data."},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"c81a3c0e-7398-31ec-b15a-c18143e24f2e"},"source":"Submissions in this competition are evaluated according to the Mean Average Precision @ 7 (MAP@7). It means that it is needed to predict no more than 7 products for every customer. Note that order matters. But it depends. Order matters only if there is at least one incorrect prediction. In other words, if all predictions are correct, it doesn't matter in which order they are given. This makes sense to show up first the most relevant results."},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"e0444038-b1ab-1076-74e4-536c9b68fe86"},"source":"## Abstract"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"bf2bcc3d-8c4e-a4a7-8caa-b175655d88f7"},"source":"1.

Honeycreeper species have diverse foraging strategies, from highly specialized snail eaters, to generalists who eat a large variety of food items. However, many honeycreepers are nectivorous, and serve as the predominant pollinators in Hawai'i forests where as many as 60% of the native trees are bird pollinated. In addition to being important to Hawai'i’s forest ecosystems, these vibrant birds were prominent in traditional native Hawaiian culture. Their feathers were symbols of power and were collected by the thousands to craft intricate capes, headwear, and lei for royalty. Honeycreepers are featured in many native stories, and were often seen as guardian spirits. Sadly, of the many honeycreepers that once inhabited the islands, only 17 species remain, most of them listed as endangered by the IUCN. Deforestation and introduced species, from non-native predators like cats and mongoose, to habitat altering plants like strawberry guava, have been particularly damaging to this group of birds. The most pressing modern threat to honeycreeper survival is the introduced disease avian malaria and its non-native mosquito vector, which is expanding up in elevation as a result of climate change and restricting honeycreepers to the precious little remaining high elevation forest.","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.084731,"end_time":"2022-02-10T22:18:55.269061","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-02-10T22:18:55.18433","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 'I'iwi (*Drepanis coccinea*)\nWith its crimson plumage and prominent curved bill, the 'I'iwi is one of Hawai'i’s most recognizable birds.

Many of these species that colonized the islands have diverged enough from other seabird populations to have Hawaiian subspecies designations. Historically, Polynesean voyagers and fishermen would observe seabirds to predict weather patterns and to guide them back to land or fertile fishing areas, a tactic still used today. Further, their feathers were used in capes and lei, and seabird chicks were a delicacy served to royalty. Seabirds are important drivers of nutrient cycling on islands where they deposit nutrients sourced from the ocean into terrestrial ecosystems, making them more productive. Because many seabird species in Hawai'i are ground nesting, human introduced predators such as rats, cats, and mongoose have been devastating to their populations, and introduced grazers like cows and sheep have degraded their nesting habitat extensively. Seabirds use the moon and stars to navigate back to their nesting sites at night, which makes them victims of an unusual threat, light pollution. Bright lights at night can confuse and disorient seabirds, often leading to collisions with walls, power lines, and other human made objects. Once grounded, seabirds are generally unable to take flight again, making them vulnerable to predation and other harm.","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.458824,"end_time":"2022-02-10T22:19:25.170079","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-02-10T22:19:24.711255","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 'U'au (*Pterodroma sandwichensis*)\nThe 'U'au is a subspecies of Dark-rumped Petrel which only nests in the Hawaiian Islands, earning them the English name Hawaiian Petrel.

Some were likely hunted directly, scientists believe, whereas others were done in by habitat degradation or by the rats, pigs, and dogs that the Polynesians brought with them.\"\n\n\"Once Europeans arrived in 1778, a second wave of destruction commenced, leading to 24 additional bird extinctions (plus the unceremonious overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy). In addition to accelerating habitat loss, Europeans and Americans introduced new and deadly avian predators, from cats and mongooses to the black rat, which, unlike the Polynesian rat, readily climbs trees to raid nests.\"\n\n\"Today, only 21 native songbird species remain on the main Hawaiian islands, 11 of which are federally listed as endangered. Most are high in the mountains, where avian malaria has yet to reach, meaning locals in the populated lowlands can spend their entire lives without ever seeing a native passerine.\"\n\nhttps://www.birdwatchingdaily.com/news/conservation/hawaii-epicenter-avian-extinction-crisis/","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1><span class=\"label label-default\" style=\"background-color:green;border-radius:100px 100px; font-weight: bold; font-family:Garamond; font-size:20px; color:orange; padding:10px\">Collapsing avian community on a Hawaiian island</span></h1><br>\n\n\nAuthors: EBEN H.

Douglas Pratt awoke in his tent pitched on Hawaii’s Alakaʻi Plateau to the song of the Kauaʻi ʻŌʻō. The bell-like vocal clarity was unmistakable, though the bird was extremely rare; the species was listed as federally endangered in 1973, with an estimated population of 36 surviving individuals.\n\n“I can still recall the hair standing up on my neck,” the retired ornithologist says. “Their song can be described as both haunting and evocative.”\n\n\"Pratt was lucky to hear the Kauaʻi ʻŌʻō, and was one of the last people to do so. The mostly black bird with tufts of striking yellow feathers on its thighs was last seen in 1985 and last heard in 1987. No one will ever hear it sing in the wild again.\"\n\n\"The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) declared 23 species across the United States extinct and proposed they lose protections under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).

The other seven are the Kauaʻi ʻAkialoa, Kauaʻi Nukupuʻu, Kāmaʻo or Large Kauaʻi Thrush, Maui Ākepa, Maui Nukupuʻu, Kākāwahie or Molokai Creeper, and Poʻouli.

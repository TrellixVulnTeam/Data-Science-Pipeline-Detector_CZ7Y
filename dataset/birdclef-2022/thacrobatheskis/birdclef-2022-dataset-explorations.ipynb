From googling I found a note about him [on Cornel Lab's facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/macaulaylibrary/posts/10156633504705424):\n\n> Paul lives in Cocoa, Florida, where he has taken advantage of the warm weather and abundant birdlife to make numerous recordings this winter in conjunction with complete eBird checklists. When he is not out in the field making new recordings, he has also been creating historical checklists to upload some of the many recordings he has made since he started recording in earnest in 2011.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.author.value_counts()[:30].plot.bar(width=0.9, title=\"Author\")\ndf.author.value_counts()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-13T20:17:40.412552Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-13T20:17:40.412878Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-13T20:17:40.846354Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-13T20:17:40.412844Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-13T20:17:40.845164Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Rating\n\nAccording to the competition description, \"Rating\" is:\n\n> Float value between 0.0 and 5.0 as an indicator of the quality rating on Xeno-canto and the number of background species, where 5.0 is the highest and 1.0 is the lowest. 0.0 means that this recording has no user rating yet.\n\nFortunately, it looks like most of the recordings have a high rating.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.rating.plot.hist(bins=10, title=\"Rating\")\ndf.rating.value_counts()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-13T20:06:52.702754Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-13T20:06:52.70317Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-13T20:06:52.948974Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-13T20:06:52.703126Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-13T20:06:52.948314Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Time\n\nI'm guessing the \"Time\" column is is the time of day when the recording took place.

However, this does not cover all the problems they encounter. How do they effectively schedule the staff? How do they know the quantity of ingredients to order? If restaurants cannot solve these problems, their business will be hurt. \n\nIf restaurants can predict how many visitors will be in one day, it's easier for them to make the arrangement. However, forecasting the number of visits is hard because it might be influenced by countless factors  (eg weather, holiday, and location). It's even harder for new restaurants with little historical data to make accurate predictions.\n\nWe are going to use reservation and visitation data to predict the total number of visitors to a restaurant for future dates. This information will help restaurants be more efficient and allow them to focus on creating an enjoyable dining experience for their customers.\n\nThe first steps were to understand the main problem, get familiar with the structure of the data and decide what features we need. This is a Time-Series prediction, so we need to be careful about the sequence of the data. In any modeling process, the data that goes into a model plays a big role in ensuring accurate results. Therefore, the relevant features that helped achieve the objective were defined and an initial feature set was selected. \n\nFollowing this, some noisy and missing data was removed. We had access to data on restaurant reservations, but the dataset was incomplete and not of much use to us. Thus we didn't take this factor into account. Too many missing values might lead to a worse result even if it's a good predictor.\n\nSome fieldsâ€™ values were imputed - for example, those of extreme actual visitor numbers on a specific day. After the data engineering, the core modeling process was started. Different algorithms were implemented on the feature set, along with cyclical addition and removal of features depending on performance and complexity of the features and the model used.

Because we are only looking to sell our system in this project, we are instead providing reasons for why someone should buy our product.\n\nWe are looking to persuade a restaurant owner to purchase our product. For them, the decision ultimately comes down to: \"How much will these predictions actually help me out? I believe I know the business and have good intuition about how many people will come to the restaurant. Are their predictions any better than me? How much money will they save for me?\"\n\nTo quantify this, we decided to run a couple of simulations on our training data based on intuition to see how good our results would be. For reference, our daily percent error (using MAPE) was 50%.\n\n1) Using the previous day, the manager would be off by 113% on average. \n\n2) Using the same weekday from the previous week, the manager would be off by 94% on average.\n\n**Staffing**\n\nThe hourly minimum wage in Japan translates to roughly [8.30 USD](https://tradingeconomics.com/japan/minimum-wages). Overstaffing by 2 people for a given 8-hour day equates to roughly 130USD in unnecessary expenses. On the flip side, understaffing means a poor customer experience as wait time is longer. We believe this provides strong support for the purchase of our system.\n\n**Supply Chain** \n\nAlthough we are not able to quantify the supply chain as easily as we can with staffing costs, owners are able to reduce expenses if they have a more accurate picture of how many customers they expect to see. Purchasing too much leads to waste, and purchasing too little means running out of ingredients and making your customers upset. Using our system provides a more stable data-driven approach to this problem.\n\n**Smoothing Demand**\n\nAlthough not covered in our project, an individual will be able to look at their past data and gain an unbiased view of seasonality that occurs throughout the year. If they are looking for stability week-by-week or month-by-month to even out their supply purchases or keep the correct number of people on board, they can use their past data to aid in offering of incentives to drive customers where they see fit.\n\n**Important Features**\n\nAnother insight we can provide the manager is an understanding of the most important features that drives their business. In particular, we found the following 5 to be most important when we ran our LightGBM model:\n\n(1) Previous year mapping  \n(2) Days since previous 25th  \n(3) Holiday flag  \n(4) Aggregated visitors per day of week  \n(5) Exponential Moving Average"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

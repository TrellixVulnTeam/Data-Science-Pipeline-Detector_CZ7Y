# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

import re

# the Naive Bayes model
from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
# function to split the data for cross-validation
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
# function for transforming documents into counts
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
# function for encoding categories
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

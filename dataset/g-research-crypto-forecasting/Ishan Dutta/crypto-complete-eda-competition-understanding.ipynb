We have amassed a dataset of millions of rows of high-frequency market data dating back to 2018 which you can use to build your model. Once the submission deadline has passed, your final score will be calculated over the following 3 months using live crypto data as it is collected.\n\n## **<span style=\"color:orange;\">Evaluation Criteria</span>**\n\nSubmissions are evaluated on a weighted version of the [Pearson correlation coefficient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient). You can find additional details in the ['Prediction Details and Evaluation'](https://www.kaggle.com/cstein06/tutorial-to-the-g-research-crypto-competition) section of this tutorial notebook.\n  \nYou must submit to this competition using the provided python time-series API, which ensures that models do not peek forward in time.

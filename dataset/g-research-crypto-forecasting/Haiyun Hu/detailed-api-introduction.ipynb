The purpose of this module is to control the flow of information to ensure that you are not using future data to make predictions.  If you do not use this module properly, your code may fail.\n\n### This starter notebook demonstrates how to use the `gresearch_crypto` module to get the test features and make predictions.\n### TL;DR: End-to-End Usage Example\n```\nimport gresearch_crypto\nenv = gresearch_crypto.make_env()\n\n# Training data is in the competition dataset as usual\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/g-research-crypto-forecasting/train.csv', low_memory=False)\ntgt_1_model.fit(train_df)\ntgt_2_model.fit(train_df)\niter_test = env.iter_test()\nfor (test_df, sample_prediction_df) in iter_test:\n    sample_prediction_df['Target'] = tgt_1_model.predict(test_df)\n    env.predict(sample_prediction_df)\n```\nNote that `tgt_1_model.fit` and `tgt_2_model.fit` are examples of the functions you need to write for the above example to work.","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","papermill":{"duration":0.010991,"end_time":"2020-10-16T21:06:02.406829","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-10-16T21:06:02.395838","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Introduction\nFirst let's import the module and create an environment.

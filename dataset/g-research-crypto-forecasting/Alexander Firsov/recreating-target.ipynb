The current notebook version provides close result, but not ideal. In average the difference is quite small, but for some rows gives values outside of normal Target range. I hope we could fix this with help of host, kaggle team and community.\n\n**Update from 9-Nov-2021**\n\nThanks to investigation from Ernesto Budia (see his [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/ebudia/recreating-target-min-periods-3750/)) we know how to get much closer match - when calculating $\\beta^a$ rolling average $\\langle .\\rangle$ should be done for full 3750 minutes.\n\nAs a result of this change  \nAverage absolute error improved 0.00099 => 0.00006  \nMax absolute error improved 2.44 => 0.045\n\n**Update from 12-Nov-2021**\n\nIt turns out that naive approach we used at the beginning gives a lot of NA values for Recreated Target, so comparison between Target and Recreated target was done only for part of data (calculating Average/Max error does not reflect real picture). Additionally host published part of code, so we try to create faster version of current calculations using this code.\n\nAverage absolute error 0.000190  \nMax absolute error 0.289100  \nStandard deviation 0.001135  \n\n**Update from 17 Nov-2021**\n\n* use x-1 instead of log(x) when calculating return R - see [comment](https://www.kaggle.com/c/g-research-crypto-forecasting/discussion/286778#1582764) by Branden Murray\n* use unique timestamps (not all possible minutes as in previous version) - check line \"all_timestamps = np.sort(data['timestamp'].unique())\"\n\nThe last change means that all shift/rolling operations are done not in terms of minutes, but in terms of available records. The difference appears when a timestamp is missing for all assets.\n\nAverage absolute error 0.000190 => 0.000000  \nMax absolute error 0.289100 => 0.003798  \nStandard deviation 0.001135 = 0.000001  ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Naive approach\nIn this section we are implementing step by step calculation based on Target calculation description.

The difference is 1086. It can be explained by [missing first minite](https://www.kaggle.com/c/g-research-crypto-forecasting/discussion/286095) of each month for each asset. \n\nIt is interesting that the Target is present in train dataset for dates like YYYY-MM-01 23:44:00 (t+16) and YYYY-MM-01 23:59:00 (t+1). For these times calculation algorithm requires price at time YYYY-MM-01 00:00:00, but this time is absent in test data. It can be considered as a proof that Target was calculated on other data, and then train dataset was built with already calculated Target.\n\nThis missing first minute of a month bug gives approximately 44 month x 2 (every row affect two targets for shift 1 and 16) x 14 (number of assets) => 1232. Some assets do not have data for all months.\n\nThe only other place that can produce NA is the following code\n> rolling(window='3750T', min_periods=3750)\n\nmissing values inside 3750 minutes interval result in NA values. \n\nNow let's look at the [code](https://www.kaggle.com/c/g-research-crypto-forecasting/discussion/286778) provided by host:\n> num = df.multiply(mkt.values, axis=0).rolling(window).mean().values  \n> denom = mkt.multiply(mkt.values, axis=0).rolling(window).mean().values  \n\nThere are two possible types of window that rolling accepts - [it can be](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/1.3.0/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.rolling.html) either shift/int (number or rows to shift) or time offset (number of minutes to shift), but there is no **min_periods** parameter. This means that for int shift it does not produce NA at all, for time offset it may produce NA only if there is no data for last 3750 minutes.\n\nNext line of the code calculates beta and removes all resulting non-number values with zero:\n> beta = np.nan_to_num( num.T / denom, nan=0., posinf=0., neginf=0.)  \n\nThe conclusion here is that adding min_periods=3750 which seemingly improved our metrics in fact added lots of NA values effectively minimizing data where these metrics were calculating.

On **April 15, 1912**, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing **1502** out of **2224** passengers and crew. This is a very unforgetable disaster that no one in the world can forget.\n\nIt took about $7.5 million to build the Titanic and it sunk under the ocean due to collision. The Titanic Dataset is a very good dataset for begineers to start a journey in data science and participate in competitions in Kaggle.\n\nThe Objective of this notebook is to give an idea how is the workflow in any predictive modeling problem. How do we check features, how do we add new features and some Machine Learning Concepts. I have tried to keep the notebook as basic as possible so that even newbies can understand every phase of it."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://preview.redd.it/0izq0428pe661.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=15022053715fc50198a17c401be035445592fee2)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##

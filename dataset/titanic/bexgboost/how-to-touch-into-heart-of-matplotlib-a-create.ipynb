Create the plot and mark the parts you want to improve.\n2. Extract a single component. Call `dir` on the axes or figure object if you don't know what you are looking for. Also, the get_* prefixed functions are helpful in this case.\n3. After you have a component, see the default values of its parameters by calling `plt.getp`.\n4. Mark the parameters you need and call `plt.setp` on each of them to see the possible values they accept.\n5. Set your custom values using the same function.\n6. Iterate through 2–5 until you have the perfect plot you need.\n\nOnce you go through this workflow a few times, you will get more comfortable with higher-level functions. Instead of extracting every component from the axes and primitives, you will start passing arguments directly to the function calls or when creating the axes.\n\nBut `setp`, `getp` and `dir` functions are everything you need if you ever encounter an unknown Matplotlib class or function.\n\nBesides, learning the concepts of artists, patches, and container/primitives has set you up to understand the documentation to its fullest extent.

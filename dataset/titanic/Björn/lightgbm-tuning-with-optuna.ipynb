What I discuss:\n* basics of how [**LightGBM**](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and other tree-boosting approaches (like e.g. [xgboost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)) work\n* hyperparameter tuning using the [**optuna** package](https://optuna.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)\n\nWhy do I primarily use LightGBM? Mostly, due to its popularity on Kaggle, which it primarily owes to its speed, which allows more extensive hyperparameter tuning due to faster iteration. Obviously, this is less of a consideration on a small dataset such as the Titanic data, but on larger data this becomes a consideration.\n\nWhat I **do not** try to do\n* extensive feature engineering/generating very insightful features, but rather hyperparameter tuning given a set of features\n* stacking or blending multiple models to improve what a single model can achieve\n* achieving a really good score on the leaderboard (see the two points above)\n* explaining model predictions using [**SHAP**](https://github.com/slundberg/shap) (SHapley Additive exPlanations)\n\nI avoid these things, because I primarily aim to achieve a clear code and explanations for hyperparameter tuning without complex code and lengthy feature engineering getting in the way."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Load the data\nFirst, we load the data and derive some basic features.\n\nNote, that we did not necessarily have to impute missing data e.g. for passenger age, because LightGBM can automatically handle missing values by assigning them a split-direction at each split (as xgboost does).

For that, we turn to hyperparameter optimization using the **optuna** package.\n\n**optuna** comes with a generic ability to tune hyperparameters for any machine learning algorithm, but specifically for LightGBM there is an intergration via the **LightGBMTunerCV** function. This function implements a sensible hyperparameter tuning strategy that is known to be sensible for LightGBM by tuning the following parameters in order:\n* feature_fraction\n* num_leaves\n* bagging_fraction and bagging_freq\n* feature_fraction (again)\n* regularization factors (i.e. 'lambda_l1' and 'lambda_l2')\n* min_child_samples\n\nWe can either entirely rely on this tuner, or additionally run some further hyperparameter search thereafter. Here we will do the latter. Arguably, you could even skip the automatic LightGBM tuner, if you have enough of a time budget, while it is particularly attractive if you have not so much time.\n\nHow do we tune? In each training, we actually optimize the log-loss, but we pick the hyperparameters that optimize the metric of interest. For the Titanic dataset on Kaggle that's accuracy, but you might argue that accuracy is not such a great metric to use, because it's not a proper scoring function, and only \"cares\" about correct (survival predicted and in truth survived, or non-survival predicted and in truth did not survive) or wrong (non-survival predicted and in truth survived, or survival predicted and in truth did not survive). That leads to a rather sparse signal. I.e. a predicted probability of 0.51 is just as good as 0.999, as long as it is above 0.5 - or whatever other threshold you choose to use to predict that a passenger survived - and as long as a passenger survives. In any case, we will maximize accuracy - or in fact, minimze binary error (=1-accuracy), which is completely equivalent.\n\nFor a full list of parameters we can tweak and objective functions/metrics, see the [LightGBM documentation](https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Parameters.html). Note that you should typically use the main named for a metric, e.g. 'l1' and not an alias such as 'MAE', because optuna and LightGBM seen to interact on unfortunate ways - at least in optuna version 2.2.0 with LigthGBM version 2.3.1 (used in this notebook) - if you don't.\n\nSince this is a pretty small dataset, we can afford to operate with really low learning rates in LightGBM, which then require more trees, but tend to increase performance.\n\nWe will use 10-fold cross-validation with random splits, but depending on how the split of training and test data was done you might want to do something different. This particular approach may be particularly relevant if the training-test split was simply done randomly (like this cross-validation scheme)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import optuna.integration.lightgbm as lgb\nimport optuna\n\nrkf = RepeatedKFold(n_splits=7, n_repeats=3, random_state=42)\n\nparams = {\n        \"objective\": \"binary\",\n        \"metric\": \"binary_error\",\n        \"verbosity\": -1,\n        \"boosting_type\": \"gbdt\",                \n        \"seed\": 42\n    }\n\nX = np.array( train[discrete_features + continuous_features] )    \ny = np.array( train['Survived'] ).flatten()\n\nstudy_tuner = optuna.create_study(direction='minimize')\ndtrain = lgb.Dataset(X, label=y)\n\n# Suppress information only outputs - otherwise optuna is \n# quite verbose, which can be nice, but takes up a lot of space\noptuna.logging.set_verbosity(optuna.logging.WARNING) \n\n# Run optuna LightGBMTunerCV tuning of LightGBM with cross-validation\ntuner = lgb.LightGBMTunerCV(params, \n                            dtrain, \n                            categorical_feature=ids_of_categorical,\n                            study=study_tuner,\n                            verbose_eval=False,                            \n                            early_stopping_rounds=250,\n                            time_budget=19800, # Time budget of 5 hours, we will not really need it\n                            seed = 42,\n                            folds=rkf,\n                            num_boost_round=10000,\n                            callbacks=[lgb.reset_parameter(learning_rate = [0.005]*200 + [0.001]*9800) ] #[0.1]*5 + [0.05]*15 + [0.01]*45 + \n                           )\n\ntuner.run()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here are our interim results after the automatic tuner."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(tuner.best_params)\n# Classification error\nprint(tuner.best_score)\n# Or expressed as accuracy\nprint(1.0-tuner.best_score)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Set-up a temporary set of best parameters that we will use as a starting point below.\n# Note that optuna will complain about values on the edge of the search space, so we move \n# such values a tiny little bit inside the search space.\ntmp_best_params = tuner.best_params\nif tmp_best_params['feature_fraction']==1:\n    tmp_best_params['feature_fraction']=1.0-1e-9\nif tmp_best_params['feature_fraction']==0:\n    tmp_best_params['feature_fraction']=1e-9\nif tmp_best_params['bagging_fraction']==1:\n    tmp_best_params['bagging_fraction']=1.0-1e-9\nif tmp_best_params['bagging_fraction']==0:\n    tmp_best_params['bagging_fraction']=1e-9  ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now let's search more broadly with the results that the automatic tuner provided as a starting point.

TPE at each step constructs an approximate surrogate model for how the performance of LightGBM depends on the hyperparameters based on what performance we have got for the values we tried, so far (note: technically, we re-write this differently using Bayes rule, but let's skip those details).

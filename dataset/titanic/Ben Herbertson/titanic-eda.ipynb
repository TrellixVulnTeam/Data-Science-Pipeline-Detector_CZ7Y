This indicates that females were more likely to survive than males (0 = male, 1 = female).\n* There is a moderate negative relationship between `Survived` and `Pclass`. So, passengers in a higher ticket class (e.g., 1st class) were more likely to survive than passengers in a lower ticket class (e.g., third class).\n* There is a moderate positive relationship between `Survived` and `CabinAssigned` (the attribute I derived earlier, which indicates whether or not a passenger has an assigned cabin).\n* `CabinLetter` has a weaker association with `Survived` compared to the other cabin attribute I derived, `CabinAssigned`. Perhaps the extra information is not so helpful.\n* There is a weak positive relationship between `Survived` and `Fare`. So, those that paid more for their ticket were more likely to to survive than those that paid less.\n* `Parch`, `SibSp`, and `Age` don't have much of a linear relationship with `Survived`. Perhaps there is some additional feature engineering work that can be done with these attributes.\n* I derived `TravellingAlone` from `SibSp` and `Parch`. This attribute has a stronger, negative relationship with `Survived`. So, passengers that were not travelling alone were more likely to survive compared to passengers that were."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='transformations'></a>\n\n# Promising transformations\n\nHere is a list of promising transformations I can experiment with when creating models to predict passenger survival:\n* Fill missing `Age` values with the median.\n* Create `TravellingAlone`, which indicates whether or not a passenger was travelling alone.\n* Drop `Ticket` as it has no useful information.\n* Create `CabinAssigned`, which indicates whether or not the passenger had a cabin assigned.\n* Create `CabinLetter`, which is similar to `CabinAssigned` but includes additional information for passengers that *were* assigned a cabin (e.g., deck `C`).\n* Drop `Cabin` because it is mostly missing, as the above attributes (which were derived from `Cabin`) should be useful\n* Fill missing values for `Embarked` with the mode.\n* Transform `Age` and `Fare` to make them more normally distributed (`Fare` is especially skewed).\n* Scale features so they have similar values.\n\nThis concludes my first round of exporation of the Titanic dataset. Of course, not all of the above transformations will be useful (in fact, some may *decrease* accuracy). Next, I will train some models for predicting `Survival` using the insights I have obtained from this analysis. Once I inspect the outputs of these models, I might continue to do some more exploration to see if there are any other potentially useful transformations."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

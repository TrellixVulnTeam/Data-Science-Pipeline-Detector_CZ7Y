I've read a few other people's notebooks for ideas on the titanic competition and wanted to throw my hat in the ring. On paper I have a few years experience in data science but really it's just been fitting linear models. Recently I decided I wanted to learn more so I started a few of the courses on here. Along with my data manipulation I've included some thoughts that popped into my head while I was working through the data. It may be useful, it may not but I thought I'd include it anyways.\n\nI'd appreciate any feedback you have to give.

That way, in the test set, if people had shared family names from the training set, they might be more or\nless likely to have survived.\n\nSo I think while this could actually improve our submission score, it is incorporating some \"future\" knowledge\ninto the model, by creating a variable that is dependant on knowing who survived after the fact.\n\nI guess that leaves me a decision to make: am I trying to write a notebook that maximises my score\n or am I making one to implement a model with actual predictive (i.e. at the time of sinking) power?\n\n As I'm new to all of this and I want to learn techniques that are transferrable, I will focus on only\n using data that doesn't depend on knowing survival. With that said, I think I'll drop family name for now.\n\nI am curious however, is there much of a discussion about this type of \"hacking\" features on Kaggle?\nI can imagine we could come up with other examples (such as cabin) where we could potentially improve a submission\nscore by making a model will less predictive power. Anyways back to the analysis...\n\nUpdate: After reading more on the topic, I don't think there is anything wrong with doing this, I might have just ended up confusing myself. The idea of \"predicting\" who survived could be seen as predicting who would survive if the titanic were to sail again with the same (or similar) population. In that sense, picking a family name as a feature is no different to picking age as a feature.

Linar models\ndo pretty poorly when the underlying data isn't normally distributed. It can really only pick up the general trend of\n\"being older is better\" or \"being younger is better\". If a linear model were used here, it might pick up that being\nyounger is better for survival but it will miss the details. As this is the only reference point I have,\nI'll try to transform the data as if I was going to fit a linear model to it.\n\nBut first, there are some missing values that need to be dealt with.\nThere are (at least) three ways we can deal with this, each one being slightly more effort.\n\nFirstly, we can just drop the rows with missing data. While this might be tempting, dropping a row with around 14\nother entries just because of one missing value doesn't sound like the brightest idea.\n\nSecondly, we can replace the missing data with the average age (whether it's median/mode/mean) of the data set.\nThis would be a good first pass method and it would let us get the models up and running.\n\nThirdly, we can replace the missing data with the average from similar passengers. For example,\nif we're missing the age of a 1st class passenger, who is female, who embarked from C etc. we could substitute in the\nage of other passengers who fit that description.\n\nAs I want to get a bit more experience using Python/Pandas I'm going to go with option 3.\nMy rough idea is to rank all the passengers based on their similarity to the missing passenger.\nI think the title and Pclass features will be good for this. I want to have a heirarchical approach.\nTry to replace with someone of the same title and Pclass, then of sex and class, then mean of just sex.\n\nUpdate: After reading around on the sklearn user guide,there is an experimental multivariate feature imputer that I am going to use to fill in all the missing data to see how it fares. I'll add this at the end as I need to drop the target feature (Survived) before I use the imputer (so it doesn't try to impute missing survived data in the test set).

Many of the notebooks I've\nlooked at combined these into a \"family sizes\" metric.\n\nSibSp: The number of siblings or spouses aboard the titanic.\nParch: The number of parents/children aboard the titanic.\n\nMaybe I'm a bit slow but this is taking a while to understand.. an example might help.\nSo for a family of 4 (two parents and two kids), the parents would each have a value of 1 for SibSp\nand the kids would also have a value of one (for their spouse and sibling respectively). The parents have 2 kids\non board and each kid has 2 parents on board. So in this case everyone would have a Parch value of 2.\n\nTo get the total size of the family from any one of the members you need 1 (from SibSp) + 2 (from Parch) + 1 (the passenger themself).\nThat makes sense, but just to be sure I'll write out another example with a different size.\n\nA man, his wife and his three kids are on board. The family size is 5 so we should be able to get this from summing SibSp and Parch.\n\nSibSp_Man: 1 (his wife) + Parch_Man: 3 (his kids) + Man: 1 = Total: 5\n\nSibSp_Child_1: 2 (their siblings) + Parch_Child_1: 2 (both parents) + Child_1 = Total: 5\n\n\nOkay this seems to work... although I can see a problem. If the man in the above example has a sibling on board,\nI would intuitively say that the family size is now 6. But you could only get 6 by summing the mans SibSP and Parch values.\nIf you tried to sum the man's brother's columns, you would only end up with a family size of 2 or 3 (the man and possibly his wife).\nI'm very likely reading into this too much but it's something to consider. By summing these two columns you end up in a\nsituation where two people can be in the same \"family\" but have different family sizes.

We start with finding feature types, missing values and we continue with feature analysis and visualization of the data. Feature engineering is implemented to create new attributes, encoding and imputation of the missing values. At last we test several classifiers and we evaluate them with the help of the ROC and CAP curves.\n\n## History\n\nRMS Titanic was a British passenger liner operated by the White Star Line that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912, after striking an iceberg during her maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making the sinking one of modern history's deadliest peacetime commercial marine disasters.         \n  ","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Contents \n1.

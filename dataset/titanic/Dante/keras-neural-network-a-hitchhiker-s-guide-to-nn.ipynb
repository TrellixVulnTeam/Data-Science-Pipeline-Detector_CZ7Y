Introduction <a id=\"Introduction\"></a>\n\nDon't panic!! This notebook will give an introduction for machine learning (ML) beginners on how to implement and optimize a simple artificial neural network (ANN) for data classification tasks.\n\nTo this end, we will apply a state-of-the-art ML framework for building and training deep learning models - the Keras API for TensorFlow 2 - to one of the most famous data sets for ML beginners: the Kaggle competition \"Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster\". The goal of this challenge is to create a ML model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic tragedy.\n\nIn the notebook, we will put a focus on how to systematically optimize and evaluate an ANN model - two very important aspects if you want to obtain a well performing artificial neural network. We will learn, step by step, how to optimize the hyperparameters of an ANN using GridSearch and cross-validation. Moreover, we are going to discuss in detail how to evaluate the quality of an ANN, analyzing e.g. the confusion matrix and the feature importance.\n\nIn general, we will see that a simple ANN performs very well as a classifier on the titanic dataset (top 2% on the competition leaderboard and with 83.3% test score one of the best ANNs published for this competition) and outperforms strong ensemble methods like Random Forests and Gradient Boosting (80.8% test score, see Appendix).\n\nBesides the detailed introduction to modeling with ANNs, the notebook includes standard techniques for feature analysis and engineering and shows how to prepare the data for the modeling process using pipelines.\n\nI hope you enjoy the notebook and, of course, I am always happy to get some comments and feedback.\n\nSo let's get started...","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Competition Description\n\nThe sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.\n\nOne of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.\n\nIn this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"[back to Table of Contents](#TOC)\n## 2.

A nice visualization for a few simple problems can be found [here](https://playground.tensorflow.org/#activation=tanh&batchSize=10&dataset=circle&regDataset=reg-plane&learningRate=0.03&regularizationRate=0&noise=0&networkShape=4,2&seed=0.37306&showTestData=false&discretize=false&percTrainData=50&x=true&y=true&xTimesY=false&xSquared=false&ySquared=false&cosX=false&sinX=false&cosY=false&sinY=false&collectStats=false&problem=classification&initZero=false&hideText=false).\n\nSo let's bring a bit of light into our model and have a look a the importance of the different features.

However, the hard part of getting a top classifier is to find the optimum set of hyperparameters. And this is what we are going to do now. \n\nFor the optimization process I went through the following steps using GridSearchCV:\n\n1. Setting the activation function and the respective kernel initializer:\nAs the activation function for the hidden layers I chose the scaled exponential linear unit function *SELU* with the respective LeCun initialization. Using the [*SELU*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02515) the network will self-normalize, where the output of each layer will preserve a mean of 0 and std of 1 during the training. This is in particular benefitial for deep networks which may face problems with vanishing/exploding gradients. For our rather shallow model this should not be a problem, nevertheless, the *SELU* performed at least 0.5% better than *ElU* or *ReLU* for different hyperparameters. \n\n2. Finding the best Optimizer:\nI tried a number of different optimizers (see parameter grid below) and adtaptive moment estimation with the method [*Nadam*](http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2015/054_report.pdf) turned out to be the best one.\n\n2. Evaluationg the optimum learning:\nThe learing rate is the most likely the most important parameter. There are several techniqus to optimize the learing rate like ploting the learning curve for various learning rates or using elaborate methods like [*1cycle sheduling*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09820). I tried several techniques, but for our rather simple model it was most practical to try different learning rates using GridSearchCV. I found a learning rate of 0.0005 (half the default value for Nadam) to deliver the best results.\n\n3. Optimizing the number of epochs:\nHaving found a good learning rate, one has to optimize the number of epochs per training run. I found 30 epochs to be a good number not to overfit the model. In general, to prevent overfitting one can use techniques like EarlyStopping or plot/compare the training vs the validation loss/score for a series of epochs (discussed below).\nI implemented EarlyStopping with a callback for GridSearchCV (see below), however, it was more practical to simply optimze the epochs and check that the training and the validation score do not diverge with increasing epochs. Especially, since with *patience* one introduces another hyperparameter which has to be optimized. Moreover, it should be noted that before using EarlyStopping whith cross-validation, [a few things](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48127550/early-stopping-with-keras-and-sklearn-gridsearchcv-cross-validation) should to be considered.\n\n4. Finding the optimum batch size: \nAgain I used GridSearchCV and found 20 instances to be the best batch size. In general, what is the maximum batch size one should use is still under discussion. There are several controverse discussions in the community.\n\n5. Find the best model architecture:\nGridSearchCV found three combinations to be very similar in performance: #layers/#neurons: 3/10, 3/15, 2/10. \nThe score of the three models lay within 0.3%. In the end I chose 2 hidden layers with 10 neurons each, since it performed best on the test data.\n\nOne can optimze the hyperparameters by running GridSearch for all different parameters at once, which might take quite a while or find the best parameters by optimizing only one or a few parameters at a time and see how the model performs. Using the latter step-by-step method, it should be noted that one might have to go several times through the different steps in order to find the optimum parameters. \n\nSo here is the GridSearchCV approach using a KerasClassifier:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#If you want to optimize with the \"best features\" dataset X_train_bf, uncomment below.\n\n# training data: default is X_train as used before \nX_train_gs=X_train.copy()\n#X_train_gs=X_train_bf.copy() #best feature dataset\n\n# test data: default is X_train as used before\nX_test_gs=X_test.copy()\n#X_test_gs=X_test_bf.copy()  #best feature dataset","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# check shape of X_train - number of instances and features\nprint('# instances: '+ str(X_train_gs.shape[0]))\nprint('# features: '+ str(X_train_gs.shape[1]))","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"keras.backend.clear_session()\nnp.random.seed(42)\ntf.random.set_seed(42)\n\n# build classifier\ndnn_clf_gs = KerasClassifier(build_fn = create_model, verbose = 0)\n\n# define parameter grid: \n# uncomment the parameters you want to optimize\nparam_grid = {\n    #\"optimizer\": ['Adam', 'Nadam', 'Adagrad', 'Adamax'],\n    #\"lr\":[0.005,0.001,0.0005]\n    #\"epochs\": [15, 30, 45, 60],\n    #\"batch_size\": [20,30,40],\n    #\"number_hidden\": [1, 2, 3],\n    #\"neurons_per_hidden\": [5, 10, 15],\n    'input_shape': X_train_gs.shape[1:]  # keep this line\n}\n\n# build GridSearchCV model with ANN classifier\ngrid_search_dnn = GridSearchCV(dnn_clf_gs, param_grid, cv=5, n_jobs=-1, verbose=0, return_train_score=True)\n\n# fit GridSearchCV model\ntraining_gs = grid_search_dnn.fit(X_train_gs, y_train,\n                                 epochs = 30, \n                                 batch_size = 30,\n                                 validation_split=0.2, shuffle=True,\n                                 #callbacks=[keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping(patience=8)]\n                                )\n                                    ","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# mean scores for training and validation model after cross-validation\nprint('Mean training score:   ' + str((grid_search_dnn.cv_results_['mean_train_score'][grid_search_dnn.best_index_]*100).round(2)) +'% (' + str((grid_search_dnn.cv_results_['std_train_score'][grid_search_dnn.best_index_]*100).round(2)) + '%)')\nprint('Mean validation score: ' + str((grid_search_dnn.cv_results_['mean_test_score'][grid_search_dnn.best_index_]*100).round(2)) +'% (' + str((grid_search_dnn.cv_results_['std_test_score'][grid_search_dnn.best_index_]*100).round(2)) + '%)')","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The validation score evulated by cross-validation is quite close to the 83.3% score obtained for the test dataset. \nAlso the training and validation score are rather similar which suggests that there is no/little overfitting.

An analysis of both classifiers can be found in appedix A and B of this notebook.\n\nI experimented with lot of different approaches for feature analysis, feature engineering, data preparation and for the final model (hence, the large number of submissions) and tried to summarized the most important aspects in this notebook.\n\nWe learned that feature engineering and the implementation of new features based on a carefull analysis of the existing features is indispensable for building a powerfull classifier.

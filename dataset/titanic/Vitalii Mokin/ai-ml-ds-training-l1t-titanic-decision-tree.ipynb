Solve all tasks after the word \"**TASK:**\", entering the code in the cell under each such task.\n\nII. Click on the top: \"Run All\".\n\nIII. Compare your results with the answers in the previous version of my notebook. If something is different - fix it. If you find an error or inaccuracy in comments or tasks in my notebook, please write about it in the comment to that notebook.\n\nIV. Perform \"**ADDITIONAL TASK:**\" (at least a few) so that the performance results (plots, feature names and/or forecast) in your version of the notebook begin to differ from my original notebook.\n\nV. Prepare the notebook for publication:\n\n* rename by changing the name at the top of the window (to the left of the words \"Draft saved\"), for example to the following: \n**Titanic: very simple Decision Tree with tuning**\nor \n**AI-ML-DS : Titanic - Decision Tree - SAIT VNTU PTL**\nwhere at the end you write the name of your team in this competition;\n* at the beginning of your version of the notebook add 3 new cells of type \"Markdown\" with the following text:\n\n-> *in the first cell* - a reference to the original source (Kaggle himself writes it on the right, but it is customary to duplicate it at the beginning to explain that this notebook is a development of another):\n\n**Thanks to [AI-ML-DS Training. L1A: Titanic - Decision Tree](https://www.kaggle.com/vbmokin/ai-ml-ds-training-l1a-titanic-decision-tree)**\n\n-> *in the second cell* - a shortlist of what you updated, changed, deleted, etc., for example (**be sure to edit it!**):\n\n### My upgrade:\n* add new plots;\n* replaced feature \"Age\" to \"Pclass\";\n* add a new feature \"Fare\";\n* model tuning (changed parameter \"max_depth\");\n* improved accuracy - LB score increase to 0.78883\n\n-> *in the third cell* (you can combine with the second, ie immediately write what is added and why) - give an explanation of the reasons for such actions: ideas, hypotheses, experimental plan, for example:\n\nI'm sure that class of cabin \"Pclass\" and fare of ticket \"Fare\" is a more important feature than \"Age\".\n\nIf your team consists of some members please write: \"We sure...\".\n\nVI. \"Save & Run All (Commit)\" of your notebook - press the button \"Save Version\" in the top right corner of the window and press \"Save\". When done, scroll through and make sure there are no ERROR messages in any cell. Sometimes it can be executed successfully, but half of the cells are with errors, then the result of execution will be incorrect.\n\nVII. If it's a notebook is on a certain dataset (not for competition), go to the next step right away. Or if this notebook for the Prize Kaggle Competition then after the committing of running go to the section \"Output\" and press \"Submit\". Make sure the system successfully accepted your submission and wrote your LB score. Calculation LB score can take some time (from a few seconds to 9 hours). If it outputs an error and LB score does not output, then return to the editor and correct the error.\n\nVIII. Publish the successfully committed notebook: press the button \"Sharing\" in the top right corner of the window, in the form at the top press \"Private\" and select \"Public\" in the list, then press \"Save\". \n\nIX. Choose tags (optional) - press \"Edit tags\" and choose for example \"exploratory data analysis\", \"feature engineering\", \"classification\", \"beginner\".\n\nX. If you are a student of my course, then please add a comment to the notebook, where you tag me, which will then allow me to quickly find it, for example, the following text:\n\n-> bad option:\n\n@vbmokin, please see how we solved this problem\n\n-> best option:\n\nThe notebook was prepared by team \"SAIT VNTU PTL\" from the course \"AI-ML-DS Training\" (tutor - @vbmokin) for the competition \"Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster\".\n\n\n\n**Good luck!**"},{"metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.068392,"end_time":"2020-11-15T02:01:12.03386","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-11-15T02:01:11.965468","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I hope you find this notebook useful and enjoyable.\n\nYour comments and feedback are most welcome.\n\n[Go to Top](#0)"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

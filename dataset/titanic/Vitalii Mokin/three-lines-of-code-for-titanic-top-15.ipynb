Early I developed a kernel (https://www.kaggle.com/vbmokin/three-lines-of-code-for-titanic-top-20) that had three lines of code based on three statements and provides a LB of at least 80% of teams - Titanic Top 20%. Now I have figured out how to improve it. I added fourth statement and created 4 lines of code and then optimized this kernel again to 3 lines of main code.This provides a LB of at least 86% of teams - Titanic Top 14%, but the leaderboard is constantly changing - Titanic Top 15% will be more reliable.

Data cleaning\n\nSo we have the following situation:\n\n#### Missing values:\n* Case 1: **'Cabin'** 77% of missing values. As long as there is 3/4 of the data missing if we would decide to mock the data it would not be trustable as long as we are are setting it by ourselves, so the most fair way to proceed is to drop this one\n\n* Case 2: **'Age'** with 20% of missing values. With a 20% of missing values we should try to fill following some strategy in order to apply the filling closer to what would be\n\n* Case 3: **'Embarked'** with 0.2% of missing values. Less than a 0.5% of missing values let us to take a different strategy as long as filling the missing values would affect nearly nothing to results. So in this case we will drop the cases where this property is not present\n\n#### Categorical values\nWe also have categorical variables that need to be encoded or dropped\n* Case 1: **'Sex'** as long as it only has 2 possibles values we can do it manually or by a label encoder.\n\n* Case 2: **'Name'** This property doesn't give useful info so drop is the best option.\n\n* Case 3: **'Ticket'** This property doesn't give useful info. Dtrop is the best option too.\n\n* Case 4: **'Cabin'** drop by missing 70% of values, also not very useful info at first sight. Maybe with less missing could be useful as \"travellers on stern side of the boat survived more than travellers on bow side\", but 77.1% is too much missing.\n\n* Case 5: **'Embarked'** has 3 possible values.

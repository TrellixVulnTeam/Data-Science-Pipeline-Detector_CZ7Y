Please let me know if i can improve incase i have left some things unexplained.\nWe are not USING EDA here. Only automatic preprocessing data in fastai and training model and getting score of top1%.\n\n\nHere, we are using dataset which is a bit extension of classic titanic dataset. you can check out this: https://www.kaggle.com/pavlofesenko/titanic-extended\n\nAnd It is fair to use this, i reckon. We are not altering test data at all. Only using new features(Like how we generate new features). Number of rows remains same in both test and training data.\n\nWe will be using newly released fastai2.0 library and standard sklearn. fastai2.0 is worth checking out https://docs.fast.ai/ It is more fast and efficient. With this, we can minimize our effort for preprocessing and gain better results.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Installing fastai2, yes its not preinstalled.

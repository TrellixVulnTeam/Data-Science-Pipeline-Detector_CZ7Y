Like you can already see from it’s name, it creates a forest and makes it somehow random. The „forest“ it builds, is an ensemble of Decision Trees, most of the time trained with the “bagging” method. The general idea of the bagging method is that a combination of learning models increases the overall result.\n\nTo say it in simple words: \n\n**Random forest builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.**\n\nOne big advantage of random forest is, that it can be used for both classification and regression problems, which form the majority of current machine learning systems. With a few exceptions a random-forest classifier has all the hyperparameters of a decision-tree classifier and also all the hyperparameters of a bagging classifier, to control the ensemble itself.\n\nThe random-forest algorithm brings extra randomness into the model, when it is growing the trees. Instead of searching for the best feature while splitting a node, it searches for the best feature among a random subset of features. This process creates a wide diversity, which generally results in a better model. Therefore when you are growing a tree in random forest, only a random subset of the features is considered for splitting a node. You can even make trees more random, by using random thresholds on top of it, for each feature rather than searching for the best possible thresholds (like a normal decision tree does).","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Conclusion\nThis was my very first Kaggle competition that I tried.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read through my first exploration of a Kaggle dataset.\n\nFor the moment, let me know if you found this notebook useful or you just liked it: I would really appreciate it!","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Plz Upvote!","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

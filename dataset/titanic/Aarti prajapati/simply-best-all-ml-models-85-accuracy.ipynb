Of the 2,240 passengers and crew on board, more than 1,500 lost their lives in the disaster. \n\nWe will go through the whole process of creating a machine learning model on the famous Titanic dataset, which is used by many people all over the world. It provides information on the fate of passengers on the Titanic, summarized according to economic status (class), sex, age and survival. In this challenge, we will predict whether a passenger on the titanic would have been survived or not.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img

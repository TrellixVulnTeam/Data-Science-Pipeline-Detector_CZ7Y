There were an estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard the ship, and more than 1,500 passengers and crew died, That's why the name DieTanic. The Titanic was the largest ship afloat at the time it entered service and was the second of three Olympic-class ocean liners operated by the White Star Line. The Titanic was built by the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast. Thomas Andrews, her architect, died in the unforgettable disaster.\n\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/7jqRQ7c/Titanic-side-plan.png\" alt=\"Titanic\" style=\"width:850px;height:300px;\">\n<ul>\n\n<br>","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Import Necessary Libraries and Data Sets.\n-----------------------------","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# data processing\nimport pandas as pd\n\n## linear algebra\nimport numpy as np\n\n# data visualization\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import style\n\n# Algorithms\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn import linear_model\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC, LinearSVC\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB\n \nfrom sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score  #for accuracy_score\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import KFold #for K-fold cross validation\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score #score evaluation\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_predict #prediction\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix #for confusion matrix","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Getting  the data\n----------------","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"titanic = pd.read_csv('../input/titanic/train.csv')\n# Print the first 5 rows of the dataframe.\ntitanic.head(5)\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"titanic_test = pd.read_csv('../input/titanic/test.csv')\n# Print the last 5 rows of the dataframe.\ntitanic_test.tail(5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Note: There is no  survived column in test data, which is our target variable and we will going to predict it.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Exploration/Analysis\n--------","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#shape command will give number of rows/samples/examples and number of columns/features/predictors in dataset\n#(rows,columns)\ntitanic.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Describe gives statistical information about numerical columns in the dataset\ntitanic.describe()\n#you can check from count if there are missing values in columns, here we can see there are some missing values in column \"Age\"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# info method provides information about dataset like.\n# total values in each column, null/not null, datatype, memory occupied etc.\ntitanic.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Lets check missing data\n----","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Let's write a function to print the total percentage of the missing values.\n# (this can be a good exercise for beginners to try to write simple functions like this.)\n\n#This function takes a DataFrame(df) as input and returns two columns, total missing values and total missing values percentage\ndef missing_data(df):\n    total = df.isnull().sum().sort_values(ascending = False)\n    percent = round(df.isnull().sum().sort_values(ascending = False) * 100 /len(df),2)\n    return pd.concat([total, percent], axis=1, keys=['Total','Percent'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# lets check missing values by columns\nmissing_data(titanic)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can see that Age, Embarked and cabin has missing values.\nnow, lets check missing values for test data.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check missing values in test data set\nmissing_data(titanic_test)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Age, Fare and cabin has missing values. we will see how to work with these missing values next.\n#### Column \"Cabin\" has more than 75% of missing values in Train and test both dataset, so we are remove it.  \n#### Suggestion: Not to impute missing data in columns, which have more than 40% of missing data.

Like you can already see from it’s name, it creates a forest and makes it somehow random. The „forest“ it builds, is an ensemble of Decision Trees, most of the time trained with the “bagging” method. The general idea of the bagging method is that a combination of learning models increases the overall result.\n\nTo say it in simple words: \n\n**Random forest builds multiple decision trees and merges them together to get a more accurate and stable prediction.**\n\nOne big advantage of random forest is, that it can be used for both classification and regression problems, which form the majority of current machine learning systems. With a few exceptions a random-forest classifier has all the hyperparameters of a decision-tree classifier and also all the hyperparameters of a bagging classifier, to control the ensemble itself.\n\nThe random-forest algorithm brings extra randomness into the model, when it is growing the trees. Instead of searching for the best feature while splitting a node, it searches for the best feature among a random subset of features. This process creates a wide diversity, which generally results in a better model. Therefore when you are growing a tree in random forest, only a random subset of the features is considered for splitting a node. You can even make trees more random, by using random thresholds on top of it, for each feature rather than searching for the best possible thresholds (like a normal decision tree does).\n\nBelow you can see how a random forest would look like with two trees:\n\n<img src=\"https://i.ibb.co/TBbZnGC/two-tree-random-forest.png\" alt=\"Random Forest\" style=\"width:450px;height:300px;\">\n<ul>\n\n<br>","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"we can start evaluating it’s performace in a more accurate way.

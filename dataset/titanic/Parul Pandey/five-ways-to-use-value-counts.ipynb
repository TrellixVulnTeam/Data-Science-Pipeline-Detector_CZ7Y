Before we decide which model to train and how many to train, we must have an idea of what our data contains. The Pandas library is equipped with a number of useful functions for this very purpose and value_counts is one of them. This function returns the count of unique items in a pandas dataframe. However, most of the time, we end up using value_counts with the default parameters. So in this short article, I’ll show you how to achieve more by altering the default parameters.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Importing necessary libraries\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Reading in the data\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/titanic/train.csv')\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/titanic/test.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's look at the first few rows to get an idea about the dataset"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Calculating the number of null values\n\ntrain.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Age, Cabin and Embarked columns have null values"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Value_Counts()\n\nThe [value_counts() function](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.value_counts.html) returns an object containing counts of unique values.This means it enables us to count the number of unique elements in a column of a Pandas dataframe.\n\n### Syntax\n\n`Series.value_counts()`\n\n### Parameters\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/597/1*j5Gi_-E-b4h6tqtbYsxTrA.png)\n\nhttps://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.value_counts.html\n\nLet's see how we can use it in our analysis"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1. value_counts() with default parameters\n\nLet’s call the value_counts() on the Embarked column of the dataset.

We can imagine that the travel condition, in term of safety, of the 3rd class passengers was bad compared to the one in 1st class, so we expect a low survival rate for the 3rd class passengers.\n* Name: name and title of the passenger, we can imagine that the name is insignificant for predictive purposes, but the title could be an interesting variable to extract from the name column.\n* Sex: categorical variable assuming values male for men and female for women. In the training set, we have more men than women (577 men on 891 total passengers).\n* Age: numerical variable for the passenger age. As we can see, the average age in the training set is almost 30 years-old, the youngest passenger was almost 2 months-old, while the oldest was 80 years-old.\n* SibSp: numerical variable indicating the number of siblings and spouses the passenger had aboard.\n* Parch: numerical variable indicating the number od parents and children the passenger had aboard.\n* Ticket: categorical variable indicating the alphanumerical ticket code.\n* Fare: numerical variable for the price of the ticket.\n* Cabin: categorical variable indicating the alphanumerical cabin code.\n* Embarked: categorical variable for the emarkation port, S stands for Southampton, Q for Queenstow and C for Cherbourg.

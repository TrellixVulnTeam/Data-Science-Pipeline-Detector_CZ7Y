Although there is a descrepancy between the number of tickets and passengers and the sum of the records (training plus test datasets), and the numbers reported who travelled via onboard and this might need rectification. There has also been no indication or information about the crew members and their details, so nothing can be know about them but the goal of the analysis and question is only which passengers survived as opposed to crew and passengers together.\n\n> Now to predict survival rate, there could have been more information, as through various analysis of numbers, tables and graphs we can conclude:\n> - more men were lost onboard for reasons we will cover soon\n> - most adult men between the ages 18 and 65 did not survive (even though we have a percentage of data where the age is not known)\n> - first class passengers were given or automatically got priority over the other classes\n> - marital status of a passenger has little correlation to survival, but added to that we could not not guess/judge/know the marital status of the male passengers (apart from those not-of-legal age to marry male passengers)\n> - another feature i.e. fare is a misleading feature and cannot be easily corelated to survival, as it is linked to few other features like Passenger class, Cabin and Ticket\n> - Passenger class, Cabin, Ticket and Fare combine give a better picture of survival\n> - we know a number of passengers across all three passenger classes have overpaid for their tickets and we can easily point them\n> - a strange fact that ones who boarded from Southhampton took the most of the death toll\n> - another strange observation there are passengers who have travelled with a ticket priced £0.00 across all three classes\n> - **to sum it up there were more female survivors and first class travellers stood a better chance of surviving**\n> - **those that travelled with a company i.e. family or friend had a higher chance of survival than those who travelled by themselves, although ones with less able dependents suffered to a visible degree**\n> - **it appears that most men were helping women, children and elderly and other less able passengers to board off the ship and in turn minimised their own chances of survival, leading to 81% male casualties**","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a href='#ToC'><span class=\"label label-info\" style=\"font-size: 125%\">Back to Table of Contents</span></a>","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='import-libraries'></a>\n\n----------\n\n# Import libraries/packages","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\n# Import library and dataset\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nsns.set(style=\"whitegrid\", font_scale=1.75)\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n        \nimport math\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# prettify plots\\n\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [20.0, 5.0]\n    \n%matplotlib inline\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='training-dataset'></a>\n\n----------\n\n\n# Training Dataset","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"training_dataset = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/titanic/train.csv')\nprint(\"Column count:\", len(training_dataset.columns))\ntraining_dataset.dtypes","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sensible_columns = ['Survived', 'Died', 'Pclass', 'Sex', 'Age', 'SibSp', 'Parch', 'Fare', 'Cabin']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"training_dataset = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/titanic/train.csv')\ntraining_dataset","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a href='#ToC'><span class=\"label label-info\" style=\"font-size: 125%\">Back to Table of Contents</span></a>","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Missing data","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install -U missingno","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import missingno as msno","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"msno.bar(training_dataset)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.heatmap(training_dataset.isnull(), yticklabels=False, cbar=False,cmap='viridis')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<i><p style=\"font-size:16px; background-color: #66cdde; border: 2px dotted black; margin: 20px; padding: 20px;\">From the above two graphs we can see that **Age (177)**, **Cabin (687)** and **Embarked (2: marginal)** have missing values.We know that there are only a finite number of **Cabins** on board and so the rest of the passengers are not travelling in a **Cabin**, and if there are missing values among those, then it's neglible as there are only a handful of cabins across the ship.Two passenger's **Embarked** status is not known. Two passenger's **Embarked** status are not known. So the only field that is unknown and could be something to think about (or investigate or impute) would be **Age**. For example, there is a tendency to impute missing numeric fields with average values or medians, and these could be tricky at time. In addition, changing any data would impact the reality of the dataset and also add/remove exisitng bias. It's best for the moment we note these details and when necessary take actions. In any case if we used this dataset to train a model using tree-based models we would come out fine, as they handle *missing/null/bad data* pretty well. Also generating features (summarised classes) out of all these fields would help to get a good picture of the class balance across these particular fields.

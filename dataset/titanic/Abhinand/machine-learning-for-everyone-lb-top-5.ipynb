{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Introduction\nThis tutorial is for people who are relatively new to machine learning. I'll get you through all the steps from importing the data to making predictions on the test set. I don't think there is a better way to start machine learning than from the Titanic Survival Prediction Challenge here on Kaggle. It is the first thing you should be able to solve on your own after learning ML. When I first started out I didn't do all that well, infact my first submission scored only 0.36, more than anything I didn't know what to do even after knowing what pandas, sklearn etc.. was all about. If you're in a similar position then it is for you too. If you read through the code you must be able to understand what I'm doing and how it must be done. And don't expect every ML problem to be as simple as this one, this is just to get you started. Anyways what you learn from this notebook may be applicable to some other real-world problems as well.

A seperator between the categories is found and a hyperplane is drawn accordingly. Support vectors are those data points that are close to the hyperplane and influence the position and orientation of the hyperplane. The function used to map data to a high dimensionality feature space is called a kernel function.\n![](http://res.cloudinary.com/dyd911kmh/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:best/v1526288453/index3_souoaz.png)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"svm_model = SVC()\nsvm_model.fit(X_train, y_train)\ny_pred = svm_model.predict(X_test)\nsvm_model_acc = accuracy_score(y_pred, y_test) * 100\nprint(\"Accuracy:\", svm_model_acc)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-29T06:16:29.976165Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-29T06:16:29.976585Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-29T06:16:30.011872Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-06-29T06:16:29.976554Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-06-29T06:16:30.01095Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div class = \"alert alert-success\">\n  <h3 style = \"color:black;\">Submission file</h3>\n</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"all_models = pd.DataFrame({\n    \"Model\" : [\"Decision tree classifier\", \"Random forest classifier\", \"Naive Bayes classifier\", \"KNN\", \"SVM\"],\n    \"Accuracy score\" : [decision_tree_model_acc, random_forest_model_acc, NB_model_acc, knn_model_acc, svm_model_acc]\n})\nall_models.sort_values(by = \"Accuracy score\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-29T06:16:30.013051Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-29T06:16:30.013522Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-29T06:16:30.026542Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-06-29T06:16:30.013478Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-06-29T06:16:30.025484Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"After comparing the models above, it appears that the Random Forest classifier had the best performance with an accuracy score of approximately 79.33.

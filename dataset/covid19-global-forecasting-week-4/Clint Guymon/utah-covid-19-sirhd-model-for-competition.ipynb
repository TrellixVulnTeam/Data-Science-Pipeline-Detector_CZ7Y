Afterwhich, people who are sick should be quarantined and social distancing practices should continue but all businesses should reopen. We should do our best to develop a vaccine as soon as possible.\n\nThe below code and analysis highlights five scenarios:\n- Without social distancing and voluntary quarantine efforts, the majority of Utah's population are infected within 30 days and 4% eventually die (>100,000).\n- With the current level of social distancing and closing of businesses, the economic price is high but to date, it's estimated that 3800 lives have been saved.\n- Opening businesses on May 1 with continued voluntary social distancing and quarantine efforts results in approximately half the population being infected over the next two months+ and 4% of those infected die (>50,000). 40,000 lives saved over no quantine efforts.\n- Scenario 4 is opening business and then closing them if hospitals near capacity. This results in slightly less deaths than the previous scenario but is likely viewed unfavorably to start and then stop the economy again.\n- Scenario 5 is the same as Scenario 3 where instead of opening businesses on May 1 the quarantine efforts are continued until June 1. The difference is unfortunately little as the number of deaths is reduced by only 1%.\n\nUnfortunately, none of those options are attractive. Keeping businesses closed beyond May 1st does not make any sense in my opinion.\n\nDetails of each of the above scenarios are below, following the initial code setup. The RO value is essentially the number of people that an infected person then infects. Based on the limited initial data from the last 4 weeks, the RO value has gone down from approximately 3 to 1 or so.  If the businesses open up (with voluntary social distancing and continued quanantine efforts) its estimated that that value would increase to 1.5. These values as well as estimated values for the rates of transfer between the groups were used as defined below.\n\nData for the existing infections, hospitalizations, and deaths are from the Utah government at https://coronavirus.utah.gov/case-counts/. Note that the below estimates are very rough as there are so many unknowns regarding the behavior of the virus with respect to infection rates and other critcal variables. For example, in Iceland, it has been reported that approximately 50% of people that are infected have no symptoms and that the current testing results in up to a 30% false negative rate (people have the disease but are told they don't)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Necessary functions to determine each group as a function of

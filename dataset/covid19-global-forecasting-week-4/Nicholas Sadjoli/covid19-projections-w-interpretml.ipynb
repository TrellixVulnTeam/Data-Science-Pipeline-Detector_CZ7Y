Other data that we're presenting (and will be appending to the training data) are collected from multiple other sources, using some tools as can be seen in the Github page [here](). The list of sources as well as the sources that we'll be featuring in this notebook are listed here, namely:\n\n1. [Worldometer Coronavirus page](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/), which we believe contains the most updated information on the number of Confirmed and Fatalities that happen globally. As of 5 April, noted to have been updated to contain the latest amount of tests that happen globally, however noted that no time series for all countries are provided yet (in Worldometer itself).\n2. Global climate Data from [Worldbank](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/902061-climate-data-api). As explained a bit later in the notebook, we believe that a country's current climate condition might have a bit of effect on the spread of the virus.\n3. [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing), who has provided quite an updated time series for the recorded tests conducted by many countries for COVID-19. It is to be noted however, due to not all countries having released test data, only several countries could have their data imputed (and not by region)\n\n## Short Introduction to InterpretML\n[InterpretML](https://github.com/interpretml/interpret) is a Machine Learning toolbox developed by Microsoft Research, with the goal of giving better interpretability to trained Machine Learning models. For COVID-19 forecasting in particular, we believe that this toolbox will provide better understanding of the correlation between many different features and the model's prediction, hopefully helping in answering some of the [scientific questions](https://www.kaggle.com/c/covid19-global-forecasting-week-4/overview/open-scientific-questions) regardng the factors which effect COVID-19 transmission.\n\n[TODO: summarize what InterpretML is, and provide some of the model examples that can be used from the InterpretML toolbox]\n\nFor this notebook, we'll create several models from the [InterpretML toolbox library](https://github.com/interpretml/interpret). These models will be trained using different sets of features (including the default features provided), which will then have their performances be compared to each other.  \n\n## Loading of Interpret_ML.\nFirst ensure that the Interpret_ML toolbox is installed with pip   "},{"metadata":{"tags":["outputPrepend"],"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install -U interpret","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from interpret import show\nfrom interpret.data import Marginal\nfrom interpret.glassbox import ExplainableBoostingRegressor, LinearRegression, RegressionTree\nfrom interpret.perf import RegressionPerf\n\nimport datetime\nimport math\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\nimport copy","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.

Based on expert opinions as well as various other works however, it seems that these features would not be sufficient in accurately predicting the total amount of Confirmed and Fatalities in the future.\n\nHence, additional data features would be required. In this notebook, several of the additional data features that we've collected can be seen below:\n\n### 1.a. Weather features\nThanks to the work by David Bonin (Kaggle user [davidbn92](https://www.kaggle.com/davidbnn92)) in his [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/davidbnn92/weather-data/output), a variation of the training data that has been appended with Weather/climate features of all regions has been provided.

However, similarly there has been caution by health experts that this might not be [true](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/coronavirus-warm-weather-will-not-slow-covid-19-transmission). \n\nAs such, we'll investigate using the InterpretML toolbox to see the correlation between any of these weather effect with COVID-19 forecasting.\n\n### 1.b. Population Data \nSpecifically, the Population Density for each region. Hypothetically, a region that has a higher population density should in theory have a higher chance of faster COVID-19 transmission. For consistency, we'll be mainly using the countries' and regions' population and population density data that was recorded by [Worldometer](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/) from their respective country pages. \n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"population_df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/covid19populationtestingdataset/Worldometer_Population_Regional_Latest.csv\")\n#population_df","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#list the unique regions in the population_df DataFrame, while also removing the 'All_Regions' tag (which indicate it's the population of the whole country, and not just a region)\npopdf_unique_regions = population_df['Region'].unique()\npopdf_unique_regions = np.sort(popdf_unique_regions[popdf_unique_regions != 'All_Regions'])\nprint(\"All {} unique regions recorded:\".format(str(len(popdf_unique_regions))))\nprint(popdf_unique_regions, \"True Victoria\" in popdf_unique_regions)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"(Note that 'All_regions' mean that the data shown in that particular row applies to the whole country, not just a particular region in that country)\n\nHowever, as can be seen it is noted that Worldometer doesn't seem to provide the Population Density features recorded for regional levels. Hence, for countries with regions in the training data, we'll instead use the countries' and regions' population data as of 2019 provided by OECD on their [Region and Cities](https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=REGION_DEMOGR#) page. It is noted that these would not likley reflect the lates population density for all region/provinces in the training data. However, we believe the difference in population density for these regions between 2019 and 2020 should be minimal enough such that the the difference should be rather minimal. A reliable source that could help with this would be helpful as an input/feedback.\n\nNote that OECD divides the regions into 2 types: T2 (Large) and T3 (Small) Regions.

Testing Data\nTesting is a very important step in detecting and (hopefully) reducing the spread of COVID-19. In particular, development of *rapid* and *accurate* tests, that is *highly accessible* to the public has been [touted](https://www.heart.org/en/news/2020/04/02/covid-19-science-why-testing-is-so-important) by [a lot](https://www.id-hub.com/2020/04/02/the-importance-of-diagnostic-testing-for-covid-19/) of [experts](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/united-states-coronavirus-bill-gates/) as one of the critical key steps that a country should focus on, to combat the COVID-19 spread.\n\nAs such, we suspect a high correlation between the amount of tests (as well as the test accuracy) against the forecasting/prediciton capabilities a model could have for COVID-19, and decided to also include the test data that has been provided by a variety of countries. Of course, it could be argued that increasing amount of tests would logically also increase the amount of *detected* confirmed cases, however faster tests should hypothetically allow for less amount of fatalities since faster and better handling of the confirmed patients should theoretically be doable.\n\nFor this, we'll be using the test data provided from OurWorldinData, which has provided testing data from several countries via their [COVID-19 page](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-testing).

predicting the spread of COVID-19 overall (Confirmed and Fatalities), thanks to the help of the InterpretML toolbox that was able to estimate the correlation for each features used. There are other features that we'd like to test, however due to the incomplete data that InterpretML currently doesn't support, we're instead omitting those features and have provided the appended training data at the end of this notebook, for use by people who would like to update this better.\n\nWe understand that the data from [The COVID Tracking Project](https://covidtracking.com/ ) exists for the US region specifically. However, since the majority of other countries don't seem to have as detailed features of testing data yet (at least based on data gathered from the OurWorldinData dataset), we have chosen to omit those data for now. Usage of such data would be one step we believe the forecasting/predicition of the COVID-19 spread could be improved.

Those questions are drawn from National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine’s (NASEM) and the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\n# The Challenge\n\nKaggle is launching a companion COVID-19 forecasting challenges to help answer a subset of the NASEM/WHO questions. While the challenge involves forecasting confirmed cases and fatalities between April 15 and May 14 by region, the primary goal isn't only to produce accurate forecasts. It’s also to identify factors that appear to impact the transmission rate of COVID-19.\n\nYou are encouraged to pull in, curate and share data sources that might be helpful. If you find variables that look like they impact the transmission rate, please share your finding in a notebook.\n\nAs the data becomes available, we will update the leaderboard with live results based on data made available from the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CSSE).\n\nWe have received support and guidance from health and policy organizations in launching these challenges. We're hopeful the Kaggle community can make valuable contributions to developing a better understanding of factors that impact the transmission of COVID-19.\n\n# Objective\n\nIn this challenge, you will be predicting the cumulative number of confirmed COVID19 cases in various locations across the world, as well as the number of resulting fatalities, for future dates."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#reading the files\ntrain=pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/covid19-global-forecasting-week-4/train.csv',parse_dates=['Date'])\ntest=pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/covid19-global-forecasting-week-4/test.csv',parse_dates=['Date'])\ng=train","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"test.tail()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"test.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#describing the details of train and test dataframe\ntrain.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"test.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#checking for missing values in train and set\ntrain.isnull().any()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"test.isnull().any()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#visualizing missing data for train and test\nimport missingno as msno\nmsno.matrix(train)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"msno.matrix(test)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#identifying null values\ntrain['Province_State'].isnull().value_counts()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#dropping unecessary columns\ntrain.drop(columns=['Province_State','Id'],axis=1,inplace=True)\ntest.drop(columns=['Province_State','ForecastId'],axis=1,inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"test.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It was seen in the dataset that the **'Province_State'** column of the training dataset was dropped due to null values being more than 50%,but some countries involved values in the **'Province_State'** too,so to include that countries,we will use groupby with aggregation function of sum for all the countries which are repeated and combining them into an single country for better day to day analysis.

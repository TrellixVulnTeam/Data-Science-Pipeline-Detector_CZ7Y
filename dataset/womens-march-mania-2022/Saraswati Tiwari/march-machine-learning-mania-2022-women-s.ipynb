In recent years the structure has settled at 68 total teams, with four \"play-in\" games leading to the final field of 64 teams entering Round 1 on Thursday of the first week (by definition, that is DayNum=136 each season).

Did it work?\nThe file identifies the game-by-game results for many seasons of historical data, starting with the 1985 season (the first year the NCAA® had a 64-team tournament). For each season, the file includes all games played from DayNum 0 through 132. It is important to realize that the \"Regular Season\" games are simply defined to be all games played on DayNum=132 or earlier (DayNum=132 is Selection Sunday, and there are always a few conference tournament finals actually played early in the day on Selection Sunday itself). Thus a game played on or before Selection Sunday will show up here whether it was a pre-season tournament, a non-conference game, a regular conference game, a conference tournament game, or whatever.\n\n#### What did you not understand about this process?\nWell everything is understandable. \nRisky strategy -\n- Picked 11 teams that would win their first match\n- Stanford and Baylor beat every team seeded 3 or higher\n- Connecticut and South Carolina beat every team seeded 4 or higher\n- Maryland wins beats every team seeded 7 or higher\n- use p=0.99999 for overriding\n\nSafe strategy\n- Picked 7 teams that would win their first match\n- Stanford, Connecticut and South Carolina beat every team seeded 6 or higher\n- Baylor wins beats every team seeded 7 or higher\n- use p=0.99 for overriding\n\n*This parts needs to be updated using this year's best teams. I'm waiting to get analysts' insights for this. Also, this was for the women teams so don't be this aggressive with the men competition as there usually are more upsets.*\n\n#### What else do you think you can try as part of this approach?\nThe file identifies the game-by-game NCAA® tournament results for all seasons of historical data. The data is formatted exactly like the MRegularSeasonCompactResults data. All games will show up as neutral site (so WLoc is always N). Note that this tournament game data also includes the play-in games (which always occurred on day 134/135) for those years that had play-in games. Thus each season you will see between 63 and 67 games listed, depending on how many play-in games there were.\n","metadata":{}}]}

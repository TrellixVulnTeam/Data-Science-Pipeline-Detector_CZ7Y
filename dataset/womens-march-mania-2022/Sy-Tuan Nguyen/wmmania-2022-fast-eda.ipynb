Remember that the current season counts as 2022.\n* DayZero - tells you the date corresponding to DayNum=0 during that season. All game dates have been aligned upon a common scale so that (each year) Selection Monday is on day 133. All game data includes the day number in order to make it easier to perform date calculations. If you need to know the exact date a game was played on, you can combine the game's \"DayNum\" with the season's \"DayZero\". For instance, since day zero during the 2011-2012 season was 10/31/2011, if we know that the earliest regular season games that year were played on DayNum=7, they were therefore played on 11/07/2011.\n* RegionW, RegionX, Region Y, Region Z - by convention, the four regions in the final tournament are always named W, X, Y, and Z. Whichever region's name comes first alphabetically, that region will be Region W. And whichever Region plays against Region W in the national semifinals, that will be Region X. For the other two regions, whichever region's name comes first alphabetically, that region will be Region Y, and the other will be Region Z. This allows us to identify the regions and brackets in a standardized way in other files. For instance, during the 2012 tournament, the four regions were DesMoines, Fresno, Kingston, and Raleigh. Being the first alphabetically, DesMoines becomes W. Since the Fresno regional champion (Stanford) played against the DesMoines regional champion (Baylor) in the national semifinals, that makes Fresno be region X. For the other two (Kingston and Raleigh), since Kingston comes first alphabetically, that makes Kingston Y and therefore Raleigh is Z. So for that season, the W/X/Y/Z are DesMoines,Fresno,Kingston,Raleigh. And so for instance, Baylor, the #1 seed in the DesMoines region, is listed in the WNCAATourneySeeds file with a seed of W01, meaning they were the #1 seed in the W region (the DesMoines region). We will not know the final W/X/Y/Z designations until Selection Monday, because the national semifinal pairings in the Final Four will depend upon the overall ranks of the four #1 seeds.\n\nThe game dates in this dataset are expressed in relative terms, as the number of days since the start of the regular season, and aligned for each season so that day number #133 is the Monday right before the tournament, when team selections are made. During any given season, day number zero is defined to be exactly 19 weeks earlier than Selection Monday, so Day #0 is a Monday in late October or early November such that Day #132 is Selection Sunday (for the men's tournament) and Day #133 is Selection Monday (for the women's tournament).\n\nThis doesn't necessarily mean that the regular season will always start exactly on day #0 or day #1; in fact, during the past decade, regular season games typically start being played on a Friday that is either Day #4 or Day #11, but further back there was more variety.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"WSeasons = pd.read_csv('../input/womens-march-mania-2022/WDataFiles_Stage1/WSeasons.csv')\nWSeasons","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-20T12:39:09.114481Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-20T12:39:09.114879Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-20T12:39:09.147758Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-20T12:39:09.114847Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-20T12:39:09.147081Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **<span style='color:#A80808'>Data Section 1 file: WRegularSeasonCompactResults.csv</span>**\n\nThis file identifies the game-by-game results for many seasons of historical data, starting with the 1998 season. For each season, the file includes all games played from DayNum 0 through 132. It is important to realize that the \"Regular Season\" games are simply defined to be all games played on DayNum=132 or earlier (DayNum=133 is Selection Monday). Thus a game played before Selection Monday will show up here whether it was a pre-season tournament, a non-conference game, a regular conference game, a conference tournament game, or whatever.\n\n* Season - this is the year of the associated entry in WSeasons.csv (the year in which the final tournament occurs). For example, during the 2016 season, there were regular season games played between November 2015 and March 2016, and all of those games will show up with a Season of 2016.\n* DayNum - this integer always ranges from 0 to 132, and tells you what day the game was played on. It represents an offset from the \"DayZero\" date in the \"WSeasons.csv\" file. For example, the first game in the file was DayNum=18. Combined with the fact from the \"WSeasons.csv\" file that day zero was 10/27/1997 that year, this means the first game was played 18 days later, or 11/14/1997. There are no teams that ever played more than one game on a given date, so you can use this fact if you need a unique key (combining Season and DayNum and WTeamID).\n* WTeamID - this identifies the id number of the team that won the game, as listed in the \"WTeams.csv\" file. No matter whether the game was won by the home team or visiting team, or if it was a neutral-site game, the \"WTeamID\" always identifies the winning team.\n* WScore - this identifies the number of points scored by the winning team.\n* LTeamID - this identifies the id number of the team that lost the game.\n* LScore - this identifies the number of points scored by the losing team. Thus you can be confident that WScore will be greater than LScore for all games listed.\n* NumOT - this indicates the number of overtime periods in the game, an integer 0 or higher.\n* WLoc - this identifies the \"location\" of the winning team. If the winning team was the home team, this value will be \"H\". If the winning team was the visiting team, this value will be \"A\". If it was played on a neutral court, then this value will be \"N\". Sometimes it is unclear whether the site should be considered neutral, since it is near one team's home court, or even on their court during a tournament, but for this determination we have simply used the Kenneth Massey data in its current state, where the \"@\" sign is either listed with the winning team, the losing team, or neither team. If you would like to investigate this factor more closely, we invite you to explore Data Section 3, which provides the city that each game was played in, irrespective of whether it was considered to be a neutral site.","metadata":{"_uuid":"49d33c08-81cb-4970-8fc2-a46a693696df","_cell_guid":"a0a82758-9b73-4703-aec8-1a151ddacabe","papermill":{"duration":0.026562,"end_time":"2022-02-17T21:39:35.053438","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-02-17T21:39:35.026876","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"trusted":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"WRegularSeasonCompactResults

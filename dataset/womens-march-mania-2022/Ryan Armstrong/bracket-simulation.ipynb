The ngrok tunnel that allows this app to work in a Kaggle notebook was inspired by [this great notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/mmotoki/men-s-march-madness-2021-leaderboard-analyzer)\n\nYou will need an authentication token from ngrok, which is free, but does require sign up.\n\nOther than that, all you need is a kaggle submission file and the ability to run the cells in this notebook.\n\nFeatures available in the simulation tool:\n* Works for both the men's and women's tournaments\n* If submission has multiple years choose any year\n* If available it fills in the backet with historical game outcomes (I have done these back to 2016 for the Men's tournament)\n* Alternatively, you can simulate a bracket with predicted odds by choosing a random seed or just selecting the favored team.\n* Allows you to manually override individual games\n* Gives you some summary statistics at the end based on your predictions and the selected outcome, like log loss and accuracy\n* Let's you download a summary table of the game outcomes you chose","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Install streamlit and ngrok\nyou will need to make a free account with ngrok and put your token in the cell below","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Downloading and installing wave.

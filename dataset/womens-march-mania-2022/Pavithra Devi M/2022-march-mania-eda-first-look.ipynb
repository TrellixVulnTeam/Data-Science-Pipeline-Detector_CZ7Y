Remember that the current season counts as 2022.<br>\n**DayZero** - tells you the date corresponding to DayNum=0 during that season. All game dates have been aligned upon a common scale so that (each year) Selection Monday is on day 133. All game data includes the day number in order to make it easier to perform date calculations. If you need to know the exact date a game was played on, you can combine the game's \"DayNum\" with the season's \"DayZero\". For instance, since day zero during the 2011-2012 season was 10/31/2011, if we know that the earliest regular season games that year were played on DayNum=7, they were therefore played on 11/07/2011.<br>\n**RegionW, RegionX, Region Y, Region Z** - by convention, the four regions in the final tournament are always named W, X, Y, and Z. Whichever region's name comes first alphabetically, that region will be Region W. And whichever Region plays against Region W in the national semifinals, that will be Region X. For the other two regions, whichever region's name comes first alphabetically, that region will be Region Y, and the other will be Region Z. This allows us to identify the regions and brackets in a standardized way in other files. For instance, during the 2012 tournament, the four regions were DesMoines, Fresno, Kingston, and Raleigh. Being the first alphabetically, DesMoines becomes W. Since the Fresno regional champion (Stanford) played against the DesMoines regional champion (Baylor) in the national semifinals, that makes Fresno be region X. For the other two (Kingston and Raleigh), since Kingston comes first alphabetically, that makes Kingston Y and therefore Raleigh is Z. So for that season, the W/X/Y/Z are DesMoines,Fresno,Kingston,Raleigh. And so for instance, Baylor, the #1 seed in the DesMoines region, is listed in the WNCAATourneySeeds file with a seed of W01, meaning they were the #1 seed in the W region (the DesMoines region). We will not know the final W/X/Y/Z designations until Selection Monday, because the national semifinal pairings in the Final Four will depend upon the overall ranks of the four #1 seeds.\n<br><br>\nThe game dates in this dataset are expressed in relative terms, as the number of days since the start of the regular season, and aligned for each season so that day number #133 is the Monday right before the tournament, when team selections are made. During any given season, day number zero is defined to be exactly 19 weeks earlier than Selection Monday, so Day #0 is a Monday in late October or early November such that Day #132 is Selection Sunday (for the men's tournament) and Day #133 is Selection Monday (for the women's tournament).\n<br><br>\nThis doesn't necessarily mean that the regular season will always start exactly on day #0 or day #1; in fact, during the past decade, regular season games typically start being played on a Friday that is either Day #4 or Day #11, but further back there was more variety.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Shape of the data file\", seasons.shape)\nseasons.head(25)\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-06T18:01:57.95556Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-06T18:01:57.955845Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-06T18:01:57.975642Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-06T18:01:57.955807Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-06T18:01:57.974795Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# see how many regions are there\nregions = []\nregi_col = [\"RegionW\", \"RegionX\", \"RegionY\", \"RegionZ\"]\nfor r in regi_col:\n    for region_name in seasons.loc[:,r].values:\n        regions.append(region_name)\nprint(\"How many unique regions are partipating in this game from 1998 -

The current list is obviously not exhaustive, and we encourage participants to identify additional mappings and upload extended versions of this file to the forums.\n\n**TeamNameSpelling** - this is the spelling of the team name. It is always expressed in all lowercase letters - e.g. \"ball state\" rather than \"Ball State\" - in order to emphasize that any comparisons should be case-insensitive when matching.<br>\n**TeamID** - this identifies the TeamID for the team that has the alternative spelling (as described in MTeams.csv).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Shape of the data file --->\",TeamSpellings.shape)\nTeamSpellings.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-06T18:01:59.314477Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-06T18:01:59.314873Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-06T18:01:59.334372Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-06T18:01:59.314841Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-06T18:01:59.332867Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"How many teams are there ---->\",TeamSpellings.TeamID.nunique())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-06T18:01:59.335925Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-06T18:01:59.336226Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-06T18:01:59.346959Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-06T18:01:59.336191Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-06T18:01:59.346089Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# How many different spellings are there for a team\nplt.figure(figsize=(30,5))\nsns.countplot(data=TeamSpellings, x=\"TeamID\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-06T18:01:59.348573Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-06T18:01:59.348913Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-06T18:02:04.32782Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-06T18:01:59.348874Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-06T18:02:04.326837Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# NCCA Tournament Seeds","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This file identifies the seeds for all teams in each NCAA® tournament, for all seasons of historical data.

For play-in teams, there is a fourth character (a or b) to further distinguish the seeds, since teams that face each other in the play-in games will have seeds with the same first three characters. The \"a\" and \"b\" are assigned based on which Team ID is lower numerically.

It can be of use in identifying, for a given historical game, what round it occurred in, and what the seeds/slots were for the two teams (the meaning of \"slots\" is described below). Because of the existence of play-in games for particular seed numbers, the pairings have small differences from year to year. You may need to know these specifics if you are trying to represent/simulate the exact workings of the tournament bracket.\n\n**Season** - this is the year of the associated entry in MSeasons.csv (the year in which the final tournament occurs)\nSlot - this uniquely identifies one of the tournament games. For play-in games, it is a three-character string identifying the seed fulfilled by the winning team, such as W16 or Z13. For regular tournament games, it is a four-character string, where the first two characters tell you which round the game is (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, or R6) and the second two characters tell you the expected seed of the favored team. Thus the first row is R1W1, identifying the Round 1 game played in the W bracket, where the favored team is the 1 seed. As a further example, the R2W1 slot indicates the Round 2 game that would have the 1 seed from the W bracket, assuming that all favored teams have won up to that point. Even if that R2W1 slot were actually a game between the W09 and W16 teams, it is still considered to be the R2W1 slot. The slot names are different for the final two rounds, where R5WX identifies the national semifinal game between the winners of regions W and X, and R5YZ identifies the national semifinal game between the winners of regions Y and Z, and R6CH identifies the championship game. The \"slot\" value is used in other columns in order to represent the advancement and pairings of winners of previous games.<br><br>\n**StrongSeed** - this indicates the expected stronger-seeded team that plays in this game. For Round 1 games, a team seed is identified in this column (as listed in the \"Seed\" column in the MNCAATourneySeeds.csv file), whereas for subsequent games, a slot is identified in this column. In the first record of this file (slot R1W1), we see that seed W01 is the \"StrongSeed\", which during the 1985 tournament would have been Georgetown. Whereas for games from Round 2 or later, rather than a team seed, we will see a \"slot\" referenced in this column. So in the 33rd record of this file (slot R2W1), it tells us that the winners of slots R1W1 and R1W8 will face each other in Round 2. Of course, in the last few games of the tournament - the national semifinals and finals - it's not really meaningful to talk about a \"strong seed\" or \"weak seed\", since you would have #1 seeds favored to face each other, but those games are nevertheless represented in the same format for the sake of consistency.<br><br>\n**WeakSeed** - this indicates the expected weaker-seeded team that plays in this game, assuming all favored teams have won so far. For Round 1 games, a team seed is identified in this column (as listed in the \"Seed\" column in the MNCAATourneySeeds.csv file), whereas for subsequent games, a slot is identified in this column.<br><br>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Shape of the data file --->\",NCAATourneySlots.shape)\nNCAATourneySlots.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-06T18:02:04.376177Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-06T18:02:04.376433Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-06T18:02:04.396086Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-06T18:02:04.376399Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-06T18:02:04.395111Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# NCAA Tournament Compact Results","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This file identifies the game-by-game NCAA® tournament results for all seasons of historical data.

Combined with the fact from the \"WSeasons.csv\" file that day zero was 10/27/1997 that year, this means the first game was played 18 days later, or 11/14/1997. There are no teams that ever played more than one game on a given date, so you can use this fact if you need a unique key (combining Season and DayNum and WTeamID).<br>\n**WTeamID** - this identifies the id number of the team that won the game, as listed in the \"WTeams.csv\" file.

Thus you can be confident that WScore will be greater than LScore for all games listed.<br>\n**NumOT** - this indicates the number of overtime periods in the game, an integer 0 or higher.<br>\n**WLoc** - this identifies the \"location\" of the winning team. If the winning team was the home team, this value will be \"H\". If the winning team was the visiting team, this value will be \"A\". If it was played on a neutral court, then this value will be \"N\". Sometimes it is unclear whether the site should be considered neutral, since it is near one team's home court, or even on their court during a tournament, but for this determination we have simply used the Kenneth Massey data in its current state, where the \"@\" sign is either listed with the winning team, the losing team, or neither team.

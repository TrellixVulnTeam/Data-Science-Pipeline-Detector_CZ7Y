This is the fifth kernel of the series `Airbus Ship Detection Challenge - A quick overview for computer vision noobs.` This short and trivial kernel creates a 1.0 submission using the data shared by the Challenge organizers in response to the discovery of an important data leak.\n\n\nThe full series consist of the following notebooks:\n1. [Loading and visualizing the images](https://www.kaggle.com/julian3833/1-loading-and-visualizing-the-images)\n2. [Understanding and plotting rle bounding boxes](https://www.kaggle.com/julian3833/2-understanding-and-plotting-rle-bounding-boxes) \n3. [Basic exploratory analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/julian3833/3-basic-exploratory-analysis)\n4.

The organizers [recognized the leak ](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbus-ship-detection/discussion/64388) very fast and proposed a plan to address the situation. Following that plan, they [released the segmentations for the test set](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbus-ship-detection/discussion/64702) and will soon provide a new test set and reset the scoreboard.\n\nUntil this reset, we can trivially generate a 1.0 scoring submission just resending the `test_ship_segmentations.csv` file as follows.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.

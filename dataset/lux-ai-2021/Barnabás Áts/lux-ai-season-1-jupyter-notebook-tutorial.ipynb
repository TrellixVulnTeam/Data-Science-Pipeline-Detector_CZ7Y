If you plan to not use Jupyter Notebooks or any other programming language, please see our [Github](https://github.com/Lux-AI-Challenge/Lux-Design-2021). The following are some important links!\n\n- Competition Page: https://www.kaggle.com/c/lux-ai-2021/\n\n- Online Visualizer: https://2021vis.lux-ai.org/\n\n- Specifications: https://www.lux-ai.org/specs-2021\n\n- Github: https://github.com/Lux-AI-Challenge/Lux-Design-2021\n\n- Bot API: https://github.com/Lux-AI-Challenge/Lux-Design-2021/tree/master/kits\n\nAnd if you haven't done so already, we **highly recommend** you join our Discord server at https://discord.gg/aWJt3UAcgn or at the minimum follow the kaggle forums at https://www.kaggle.com/c/lux-ai-2021/discussion. We post important announcements there such as changes to rules, events, and opportunities from our sponsors!\n\nNow let's get started!\n\n## Prerequisites\n\nWe assume that you have a basic knowledge of Python and programming. It's okay if you don't know the game specifications yet! Feel free to always refer back to https://www.lux-ai.org/specs-2021.\n\n## Basic Setup\n\nFirst thing to verify is that you have **Node.js v12 or above**. The engine for the competition runs on Node.js (for many good reasons including an awesome visualizer) and thus it is required. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). You can then verify you have the appropriate version by running\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Ezt a cellat nem kell lefuttatnod.

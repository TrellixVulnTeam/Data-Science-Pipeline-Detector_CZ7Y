Here are two of the most important types to keep track of, as they can often be mistaken for one another.\n\n**Position:** any variable name with the full word \"position\" is a Position object, provided by the game. This will have attributes x and y for the two coordinates. On the other hand, I find it useful to use the shortened \"pos\" variable name if I was using a tuple in the form (x, y), though I did not use any tuple formats in this example.\n\n**Cell:** any variable name with the word \"cell\" is a Cell object. This will have an attribute pos which stores a Position object. It is important to remember that a Cell IS NOT a Position, but it has a Position.\n\n\n## Helper Functions\nProbably the most helpful feature I have included in the demo are the helper functions. These were blocks of code that I find myself using a lot, so I stuck them into neatly packaged functions. I also attempted to maintain good naming conventions and be as clear as possible with types.\n\n**researched(resource):** Given a Resource object, returns True if the resource type has been researched by the player.\n\n**get_cells(cell_type):** Returns a list of Cell objects of the type specified. I created a list of preset types that tend to be useful: resource, researched resource, player citytile, enemy citytile, empty. This may be slightly different than some of the other demos which use a find_resource() function to return a list of Resource objects. I do not do this to maintain consistency with the Cell type, and because any Cell with a resource on it can return the Resource object with Cell.resource.\n\n**find_nearest_position(target_position, option_positions):** Returns the nearest position from option_positions to target_position. Both target_position and the elements of the option_positions list should be Position objects (hence the use of the full word). However, since it is often annoying to convert a list of Cells to their corresponding Position objects, the option_positions param can also take a list of Cells or Units, which will automatically be converted to Positions.\n\n**move_unit(unit, position):** Moves the given unit towards the given position. This function adds some useful functionality to the basic unit.move() action. First, it does a basic check for collisions, so no two Units ever attempt to move to the same cell. Next, I have it creating lines to show where the unit is attempting to travel.\n\n**go_home(unit):** A simple function which moves the unit towards the nearest citytile.\n\n\n## The Algorithm\nTo avoid giving away too much strategy, I have kept this algorithm very brief. It does not build new citytiles and is not optimized for faster resource collection. However, it does provide a nice example of how you might structure your code or start developing strategies. I have also marked a place to insert a conditional statement to build new citytiles. \n\n## Happy Coding!\nThanks for reading through everything, if you did.

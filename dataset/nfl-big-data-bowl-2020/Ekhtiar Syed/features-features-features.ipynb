For each type of formation presented in our dataset, I wrote down a short description below:\n\n* [Singleback](https://www.xsosfootball.com/singleback-formation-sets/) - A classic running formation, where the running back lines up behind the quater back, and the wide receivers are spread out accross the field to create room for the running back.\n* [Shotgun](https://www.xsosfootball.com/shotgun-formation-sets/) - A classic passing formation, where the team is typically expected to throw the ball to the wide receivers. The running back usually lines up next to the quater back.\n* [I Formation](https://www.xsosfootball.com/i-formation-and-sets/) - A very common running formation, where the running back lines up behind the quater back, like the singleback formation. However, there is a full-back in between the quater back and the running back. The role of the full-back is to provide block (push other defenders away) and make room for the running back. Sometimes full-back also runs with the ball instead to throw in the element of surprise.\n* [Pistol](https://www.liveabout.com/the-shotgun-and-the-pistol-1335526) - Kind of a variation of Shotgun formation, with more hybrid formation to also give a good support for running back.\n* [Jumbo](https://www.xsosfootball.com/shotgun-empty-base-breakdown/) - This is the formation without a running back, or empty backfield. Very similar to Shotgun, except no running back at all.\n* [Wildcat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcat_formation) - A player from another position (running back, full back) takes the snap of the ball instead of quaterback. \n* [Ace](https://www.xsosfootball.com/formation-breakdown-singleback-ace/) - Very similar to I-Formation, except there is two tight-ends in the line of scrimmage. Tight Ends are big units, which means additional blocking option for the running back.\n* Empty - I am going to treat this as formation that are not well known, or documented.","attachments":{}},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# print yard per offensive formation\nfig = go.Figure(go.Bar(\n            x=train_df.groupby('OffenseFormation').mean()['Yards'].values,\n            y=train_df.groupby('OffenseFormation').mean()['Yards'].index,\n            orientation='h', ))\n\nfig.update_layout(title=\"Avg Yard Per Play For Different Formation\", xaxis_title=\"Avg Yards\", yaxis_title=\"Formation\")\n\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Interesting enough, for the passing formation Shotgun, the yard gain is very good!

The first generation of Artifical Turf gave it a bad reputation, as players really didn't feel they could perform well in those carpet-like fields. However, according to this [article](https://www.lawnstarter.com/blog/sports-turf/nfl-mlb-teams-artificial-turf-2019/) Artificial Turfs are making a big comeback. This is largely due to the new generation of Aritifical Turfs can help reduce injury and give players a consistent platform to perform despite of the weather condition. If you take a look at the following list of field types, there are too many and specific types. This may overwhelm or overfit our model, so like this [discussion](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2020/discussion/112681#latest-649087) mentions, I am interested to know if the field is a grass field or not.

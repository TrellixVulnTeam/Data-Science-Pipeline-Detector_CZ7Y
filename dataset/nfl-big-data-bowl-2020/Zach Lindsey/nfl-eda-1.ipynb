GameId, PlayId\n2. Team\n3. S, A\n3. Dis\n3. NflId\n4. JerseyNumber\n5. Season\n6. Quarter\n7. Down\n8. Distance\n9. HomeScoreBeforePlay\n10. VisitorScoreBeforePlay\n11. DefendersInTheBox\n12. PlayerHeight\n13. PlayerWeight\n14. Week\n15. Temperature\n16. Humidity\n\n**Position and Direction Changes**\n\nI think it'd be best to make all plays going towards the right and to only record the player's X distance relative to the line of scrimmage or ball carrier, rather than absolute X. \n\n1. X - shift and flip\n2. Y - shift\n3. Orientation - change angle\n4. Dir - change angle\n5. Yardline - must be altered to an appropriate X value\n\n**Drops**\n\nRemove these features.\n\n1. Displayname - already accountedfor in NflId\n2. NflIdRusher - instead, make the rusher a specific column of the data entry\n3. FieldPosition - incorporated into the yardline after it's been shifted\n4. PlayerCollegeName - it seems unlikely this is important compared to other stats\n5. PlayDirection - used to flip other vars, then not needed\n\n**Conversions and Recodings**\n\nStandardize the following.\n\nThese variables have different conventions.\n1. HomeTeamAbbr\n2. VisitorTeamAbbr\n3. PossessionTeam\n\nConvert the gameclock to raw seconds\n1. Gameclock\n\nConvert birthdate to age\n1. PlayerBirthDate\n\nConvert these to a more standard data format or delete\n1. TimeSnap\n2. TimeHandoff\n\nRecode for consistency\n1. OffenseFormation\n2. GameWeather\n3. StadiumType\n4. Turf\n5. Location\n6. WindDirection/WindSpeed - Swap the odd value out\n7. Stadium\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"raw_data['Dis'].plot(kind='hist', bins=50)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

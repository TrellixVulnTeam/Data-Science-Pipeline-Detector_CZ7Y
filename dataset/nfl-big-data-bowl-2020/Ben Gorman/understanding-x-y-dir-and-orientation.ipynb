X and Y give the player positions on the field\n2. The field is 120 yards long by 53.3 yards wide but players can go out of bounds so don't expect every player's (X,Y) to be within that range\n3. Suppose a rusher's X coordinate is 20. If *PlayDirection* is 'left', he is 10 yards from scoring. If *PlayDirection* is 'right', he is 90 yards from scoring."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# The Two Coordinate Reference Systems\n*Dir* and *Orientation* are both given as angles in the range \\[0, 360\\]. *Dir* gives the angle the player is moving and *Orientation* gives the angle the player is facing, each at the time the ball is handed to the rusher. Through some experimentation, I've determined that there are two different coordinate reference systems for these measuring angles. They are\n\n## 1. (0° on right, clockwise rotation)\n**Used for:**\n1. *Orientation* where *Season* == 2017\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/MFAW8FQ.png)\n\n## 2. (0° on top, clockwise rotation)\n1. *Orientation* where *Season* > 2017 and\n2. *Dir*\n![Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/a0jxkYp.png)\n\n(Thanks to Peter Hurford for [pointing out that Orientation is shifted by 90 degrees in 2017](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2020/discussion/113384#latest-653467))"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# How to Standardize?\nThere are a number of ways you could standardize this data. I prefer to transform every angle into the system (0° on right, counter clockwise rotation), because this makes cos(angle) increase in the same direction as X and sin(angle) increase in the same direction as Y.

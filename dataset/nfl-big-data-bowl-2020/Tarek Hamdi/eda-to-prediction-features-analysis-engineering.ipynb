In this competition, you will develop a model to predict how many yards a team will gain on given rushing plays as they happen. You'll be provided game, play, and player-level data, including the position and speed of players as provided in the NFL’s Next Gen Stats data. And the best part - you can see how your model performs from your living room, as the leaderboard will be updated week after week on the current season’s game data as it plays out."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Contents of the Notebook:**\n\n**Part_1:** Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA):\n1.

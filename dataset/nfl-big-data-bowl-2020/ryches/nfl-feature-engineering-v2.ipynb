{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Feature Engineering\nThe goal of this notebook is to try to brainstorm from the data given what might help us predict the yards gained on a play"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I'm going to focus on six different kinds of factors:\n1.  **Formation**:\nEven if you have the best players in the world, if you line them up in the wrong formation your team might lose big yardage. Inversely it doesn't matter how fast your running back is if you don't open a lane for him to run.  \n2. **Overall Team Attributes**: \nHaving a strong overall team is very important to protecting the ball carrier. It only takes one defender breaking your offensive line to totally ruin a play. A game can be signficantly be influence by a standout individual, but overall strength of the rest of the team is going to greatly affect consistency and can recover botched plays.\n3. **Individual Player Attributes**: As stated previously an individual can have a huge impact on a play. Either a running back who's exceptionally fast and shifty and can get past everyone even in tight spaces or a great defender breaking through and stopping the runner before he even gets up to speed. \n4. **Matchups**: One of the biggest chances for a big play is one where there is a large mismatch in personnel. One team has their fastest and strongest player and they somehow get pitted against someone signficantly undersized and they just get overpowered. Managing it so that the constantly shifting 11 attacking players is matching with equally matched defending 11 players is difficult. \n\n5. **Weather Conditions**:I don't think this is going to be the biggest factor in yardage but it still can play some part. A team might choose to run the ball instead of pass even when they would rather be passing when it's extremely cold or windy or the rushers may run out of steam over time if they get a lot of plays and it's exceptionally hot. \n\n6. **Game Condition**: Position on the field greatly effects which plays are called and also how desparate they are for yards. A team may intentionally go for a 1 yard play just to get a down or they may be desparate and intentionally open up and risk everything. They may be crunched for time and need to just make something happen at the end of the game before the clock ticks down. One additional thing I think some people might miss is that sometimes this can directly limit the distribution possible. It is impossible to get 100+ yards gain when a team is on the 5 yard line and inversely it is impossible to lose 30 yards when a team is on their own 20.

Our task is to individually identify each of the Whales and Dolphins in the test set images using their unique individual characteristics such as shapes, features and markings (some natural, some acquired) of dorsal fins, backs, heads and flanks. This is similar to uniquely identifying human individuals by looking at their faces and other visual features of the body\n\n## Evaluation\nThe evaluation metric is the Mean Average Precision @ 5 (MAP@5):\n$$\nMAP@5 = \\frac{1}{U} \\sum_{u=1}^{U}  \\sum_{k=1}^{min(n,5)} P(k) \\times rel(k)\n$$\nwhere U is the number of customers, P(k) is the precision at cutoff k, n is the number predictions per image, and rel(k) is an indicator function equaling 1 if the item at rank k is a relevant (correct) label, zero otherwise.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Exploring the data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Exploring train.csv","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd\nimport os\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport cv2","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-12T15:39:13.878821Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-12T15:39:13.87941Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-12T15:39:16.03418Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-12T15:39:13.879296Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-12T15:39:16.03314Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df = pd.read_csv('../input/happy-whale-and-dolphin/train.csv')\ntrain_df.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-12T15:39:16.036057Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-12T15:39:16.036304Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-12T15:39:16.154037Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-12T15:39:16.036271Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-12T15:39:16.153195Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df.info()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-12T11:13:28.094141Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-12T11:13:28.094449Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-12T11:13:28.128335Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-12T11:13:28.094421Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-12T11:13:28.127613Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(f'There are {train_df[\"individual_id\"].count()} images corresponding to {train_df[\"individual_id\"].nunique()} individuals')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-12T11:15:26.666578Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-12T11:15:26.667195Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-12T11:15:26.686953Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-12T11:15:26.667139Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-12T11:15:26.686199Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sorted(train_df['species'].unique())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-12T11:08:24.093871Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-12T11:08:24.094421Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-12T11:08:24.101701Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-12T11:08:24.094396Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-12T11:08:24.101342Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As we can see, there are some inconsistent names in the spcies column.

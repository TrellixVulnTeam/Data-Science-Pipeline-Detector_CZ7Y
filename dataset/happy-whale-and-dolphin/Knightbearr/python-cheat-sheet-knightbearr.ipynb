There are (at least) two distinguishable kinds of errors: syntax errors and exceptions.\n\n### **The Most Common Python Exceptions:**\n\n* **AssertionError** = Raised when the assert statement fails.\n* **AttributeError** = Raised on the attribute assignment or reference fails.\n* **EOFError** = Raised when the input() function hits the end-of-file condition.\n* **FloatingPointError** = Raised when a floating point operation fails.\n* **ImportError** = Raised when the imported module is not found.\n* **IndexError** = Raised when the index of a sequence is out of range.\n* **KeyError** = Raised when a key is not found in a dictionary.\n* **KeyboardInterrupt** = Raised when the user hits the interrupt key (Ctrl+c or delete).\n* **MemoryError** = Raised when an operation runs out of memory.\n* **NameError** = Raised when a variable is not found in the local or global scope.\n* **RuntimeError** = Raised when an error does not fall under any other category.\n* **StopIteration** = Raised by the next() function to indicate that there is no further item to be returned by the iterator.\n* **SyntaxError** = Raised by the parser when a syntax error is encountered.\n* **IndentationError** = Raised when there is an incorrect indentation.\n* **TabError** = Raised when the indentation consists of inconsistent tabs and spaces.\n* **TypeError** = Raised when a function or operation is applied to an object of an incorrect type.\n* **UnboundLocalError** = Raised when a reference is made to a local variable in a function or method, but no value has been bound to that variable.\n* **UnicodeError** = Raised when a Unicode-related encoding or decoding error occurs.\n* **ValueError** = Raised when a function gets an argument of correct type but improper value.\n* **ZeroDivisionError** = Raised when the second operand of a division or module operation is zero.\n\nIf you want to know more about Error in Python, here's the link : \n\n* https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/error-types-in-python\n* https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/errors.html","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **How to Troubleshot the Errors**\n\nPython has a useful statement, design just for the purpose of handling exceptions, **try/except** statement, Here's the code showing you can catch KeyErrors in dictionary using this statement:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **1.

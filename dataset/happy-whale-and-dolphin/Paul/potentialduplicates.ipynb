I found two such instances of this happening.\n\nMy processes basically followed what @appian did here https://www.kaggle.com/code/appian/let-s-find-out-duplicate-images-with-imagehash/notebook. I had to run the hashing locally, as Kaggle kept dying on me. I then had to pay for CoLab+ to run the similarity calculations, as it took about 20GB of RAM to do, which I don't have.\n\nI have supplied the results of my runs as a saved numpy file in the \"whalesimularitydata\". 90.npy contains above 90% similarity, 91.py contains above 91% similarity and so on. Format of each is is a ndarray with each element being [(whale1image,whale1species,whale1ID),(whale2image,whale2species,whale2ID)]\n\nI found that only >0.95 images had a chance of being true positives of mis-identified whales. 0.94 and below were likely false positives.\n\n**How does this impact the competition?**\nIt doesn't as far as I can tell, as these mis-identified images don't show up in the testset.

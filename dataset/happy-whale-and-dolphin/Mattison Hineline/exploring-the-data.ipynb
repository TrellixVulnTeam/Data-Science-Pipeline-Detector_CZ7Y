First, we will open the image. Then, we will increase the contrast. We increase the contrast to improve the edge detector function output. Then we run the Canny Edge Detector function on the image. When the edges (ie fin) is detected we \"zoom in\" to that part of the image. Then we reshape the image to be 300x200 pixels for conguency across all images.

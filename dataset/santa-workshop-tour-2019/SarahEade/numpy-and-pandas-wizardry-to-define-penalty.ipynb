{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Numpy is Beautiful**\n\nAs I was exploring some of the kernels for this challenge, I realized how much time I spent understanding the way some of the cost matrices were coded. These cost matrices specified the penalty for a specific family (i) being assigned to a certain day (j). As I was reading through the code of lookups, loops, etc. I thought there has to be a cleaner, faster way.\n\nAnd numpy came to my rescue. Hopefully this gives people some ideas for how to improve their coding skills!"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"N_DAYS = 100\nN_FAMILIES = 5000\nN_CHOICES = 10\n\ndata = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/santa-workshop-tour-2019/family_data.csv', index_col='family_id')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First create an array that is 5000 x 11.

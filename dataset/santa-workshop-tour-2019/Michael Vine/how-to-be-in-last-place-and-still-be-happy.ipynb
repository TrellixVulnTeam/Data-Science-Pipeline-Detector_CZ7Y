{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## This is a shining moment for all aspiring data scientists (at least for me)\n\nI am not the best at this kaggle competition stuff, but I join and I try. After 4 solid days of thinking about how to assign a family a day without family_id being a factor (a.k.a shuffling the family_ids), I finally wrote a function that simply assigns a day to the family. Is it perfect? Not even close. is it functional? I mean it is a function and all so I guess so. I will eventually try to find a better output with testing the giving cost functions, but it is a great day. \n\nThank you to all that look at this!!"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport random as rnd","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv('../input/santa-workshop-tour-2019/family_data.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"d = rnd.sample(range(0,5000),5000)\nday_dict = {}\nfam_dict = {}\ndf = data\nfor i in range(100,0,-1):\n    day_dict[i] = 0","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def get_choice_for_family(df, family_id, day_dict,fam_dict):\n    c=1\n    row = df[df['family_id'] == family_id]\n    while c < 11:\n        if day_dict[row.iloc[0,c]] >289:\n            c += 1\n        else:\n            day_dict[row.iloc[0,c]] += int(row.n_people)\n            break\n    fam_dict[family_id] = [row.iloc[0,c],c-1]\n    return day_dict, fam_dict","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"for i in d:\n    x = get_choice_for_family(df, i, day_dict, fam_dict)\n    day_dict = x[0]\n    fam_dict = x[1]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"min(day_dict.values())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"len(fam_dict)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fam_id = list(fam_dict.keys())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"assigned_day = list(fam_dict.values())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"assigned_days = [i[0] for i in assigned_day]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"final = {'family_id':fam_id,'assigned_day':assigned_days}","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sub = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(final)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sub = sub.sort_values(by='family_id')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sub.to_csv('sub.csv', index=False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.5"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

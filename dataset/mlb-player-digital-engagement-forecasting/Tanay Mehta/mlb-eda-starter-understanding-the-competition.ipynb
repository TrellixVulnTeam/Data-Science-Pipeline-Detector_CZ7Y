A pitcher throws a no-hitter. A team gets red hot going into the Postseason. We know some of the catalysts that increase baseball fan interest. Now Major League Baseball (MLB) and Google Cloud want the Kaggle community‚Äôs help to identify the many other factors which pique supporter engagement and create deeper relationships betweens players and fans.\n\nIn this competition, we will predict how fans engage with MLB players‚Äô digital content on a daily basis for a future date range. You‚Äôll have access to player performance data, social media data, and team factors like market size. Successful models will provide new insights into what signals most strongly correlate with and influence engagement.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<hr>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## What is our task? üéØ\n\nIn this competition, we are tasked with forecasting four different measures of engagement (`target1`-`target4`) for a subset of MLB players who are active in the 2021 season.\n\nThe data contains a set of static files that do not change with time as well as a training file of daily data which is grouped by the day.\n\nThis is a code competition that relies on a time-series module to ensure models do not peek forward in time. The time series module provides you with the test data and writes your submission file automatically. The test data arrives in a data frame identical in format to `train.csv`, except it does not contain the target values.\n\nYou are highly recommended to visit the

You‚Äôll have access to player performance data, social media data, and team factors like market size. Successful models will provide new insights into what signals most strongly correlate with and influence engagement.\n\n## ‚ùÑÔ∏è Problem Statement\n\nIn this competition, the task is to \"forecast\" four different measures of engagement (`target1` - `target4`) for a subset of MLB players who are active in the 2021 season. \n\nSince we have to forecast, given an input date `d` we need to predict `target1` - `target4` for the date `d+1`.\n\n## üìú Training Data\n\nWe have both \"static\" files and \"daily\" data: \n\n* Static files - The files that are static are `players.csv`, `teams.csv`, `seasons.csv`, and `awards.csv`. These files don't change with time or to put it simply there is no continuous date column in these `csv` files. \n\n* Daily file - We have a `train.csv` file which is grouped by day or simply put there is a continuous date column. The first row is associated with the date `01-01-2018` and last row is associated with `some-date`. <br>\n\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/gb6B4ig.png\" width=\"400\" alt=\"Weights & Biases\" />\n\n# üíé W&B Tables\n\nWB Tables accelerate the ML development lifecycle by giving users the ability to rapidly extract meaningful insights from tabular data. The WB Table Visualizer provides an interactive interface to perform powerful analytics functions like grouping, joining, and creating custom fields while simultaneously supporting rich media annotations such as bounding boxes and segmentation masks. \n\nWB Tables is designed \"generically\" to work well for a wide range of use cases - from analyzing intermediate data transformations to reviewing model predictions - while being directly integrated directly into the WB UI dashboard, allowing users to learn, adapt, and improve their models effectively and efficiently.\n\nLearn more about W&B Tables [here](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/data-vis). Note that this feature is still work in progress and would love if you use and and send over feedbacks. \n\n## ‚ô£Ô∏è About this kernel\n\nIn this kernel, we will go through each csv files and perform meaningful EDA. We will use W&B Tables for quick EDA and W&B Custom Charts for more complex visualizations. We will also use conventional matplotlib to get some insights. \n\nThis is a work in progress. :D","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# ‚öôÔ∏è Imports and Setups","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install --upgrade -q wandb","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-18T01:27:40.438912Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-18T01:27:40.439532Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-18T01:27:53.363596Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-18T01:27:40.439429Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-18T01:27:53.362469Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nos.environ[\"WANDB_SILENT\"] = \"true\"\nimport gc\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\nimport wandb\nwandb.login()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-18T01:28:06.606883Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-18T01:28:06.607402Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-18T01:28:09.667891Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-18T01:28:06.607367Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-18T01:28:09.666737Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> Find you API key at: https://wandb.ai/authorize","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"CONFIG = dict(\n    competition = 'mlb',\n    _wandb_kernel = 'ayut',\n    infra = \"Kaggle\",\n)","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-18T01:28:37.182618Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-18T01:28:37.183362Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-18T01:28:37.188021Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-18T01:28:37.183322Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-18T01:28:37.187147Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Load CSV Files","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"ROOT_PATH = \"/kaggle/input/mlb-player-digital-engagement-forecasting/\"\n\n# training file\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv(f\"{ROOT_PATH}/train.csv\")\n\n# meta files\nplayers_df = pd.read_csv(f\"{ROOT_PATH}/players.csv\")\nteams_df = pd.read_csv(f\"{ROOT_PATH}/teams.csv\")\nseasons_df = pd.read_csv(f\"{ROOT_PATH}/seasons.csv\")\nawards_df = pd.read_csv(f\"{ROOT_PATH}/awards.csv\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-18T01:28:41.238529Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-18T01:28:41.2389Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-18T01:30:00.635325Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-18T01:28:41.238868Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-18T01:30:00.633676Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# EDA of Static CSV files","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1Ô∏è‚É£ players.csv\n\n> #### üìå Column Names and Descriptions <br> \n`playerId` - Unique identifier for a player. <br>\n`playerName` - Name of players.

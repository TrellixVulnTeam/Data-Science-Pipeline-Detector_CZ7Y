Station 24, 25 has by far the most number of features, more than 200 feature per stations! at the same time most of the stations has less than 20 features. And worth noticing that station 32 has only one feature.\n\n 2. Not all stations have the same number of records or product! Does it mean that each product doesn't go through each station? could it be that we have different types of products and each one get processed through different station? Based on my understanding on manufacturing if let's say we are producing Orange Juice, then each juice box will go through the same process and the same machines until the juice is ready. Can someone tell me why the numbers are not equal for all the stations?\n\n 3. The suspicious station 32 has really a minimal number of records. So it doesn't process a lot of products.\n\n 4. Also worth noting that station 32 has by far most of QC failures almost 0.5%. At the same time all of the other stations has less than 0.1% as a failure rate! But wait S32 doesn't process a lot of records, so 0.5% of low number of records is minimal. However if each other station has a failure rate of 0.1% of the total production quantity then this number will add up eventually."}],"metadata":{"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.5.2"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}

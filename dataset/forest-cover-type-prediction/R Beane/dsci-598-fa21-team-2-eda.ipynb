The purpose of this EDA notebook is to provide an overview of how python visualization tools can be used to understand the complex and large dataset. EDA is the first step in this workflow where the decision-making process is initiated for the feature selection. Some valuable insights can be obtained by looking at the distribution of the target, relationship to the target and link between the features.\n\nThe study area includes four wilderness areas located in the Roosevelt National Forest of Northern Colorado. Each observation is a 30m x 30m patch. There are seven forest cover types:\n\n1. Spruce/Fir\n2. Lodgepole Pine\n3. Ponderosa Pine\n4. Cottonwood/Willow\n5. Aspen\n6. Douglas-fir\n7.

They also have the highest ranges of all features.\n- `Slope` has the lowest maximum value and range. The `Aspect` feature follows closely behind this same concept.\n\nIt is good to note that the reason some features are widely spread and have high values, is because 5 out of the 10 variables are measured in meters. These variables are: `Elevation`,`Horizontal_Distance_To_Hydrology`,`Vertical_Distance_To_Hydrology`,`Horizontal_Distance_To_Roadways`,`Horizontal_Distance_To_Fire_Points`. This makes sense that these have high values and ranges.\n\n\nFeatures like `Aspect` and `Slope` are measured in degrees which means there maximum values can't go above 360. `Hillshade` features can only take on a maximum value of 255.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"num_features.describe()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Part 2.

This may mean all the observations can be from any one Wilderness Area.\n- Probability wise, the next observation that we get will have a 42.0% probability take from `Wilderness_Area3`, 30.9% probability take from `Wilderness_Area4` and so on for others. \n    - We can look into more details with the following plot in the *Feature Visualization Section*: **Barplot #2**.\n- Probability wise, we can document the same for `Soil_Types` too. \n    - We can look at **Barplot #3** in *Feature Visualization Section*.\n\n\nBy looking at these statistics of two different data types, we can see that there are different spreads and uneven amount of distribution.

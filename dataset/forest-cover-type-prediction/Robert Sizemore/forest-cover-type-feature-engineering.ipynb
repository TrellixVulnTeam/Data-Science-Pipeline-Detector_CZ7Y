In particular, we will do the following:\n\n* Define a function for cross-validation and generating test predictions\n* Get a baseline using the original data with no feature engineering\n* Consolidate prior feature engineering from other sources\n* Create new features from the soil type columns\n* Create a submission combining all new features\n\nThe main contribution of this notebook is in the testing of features based on the soil type. Using the [information given](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/covtype/covtype.info) with the original dataset we can extract features from the soil type which improve the cross-validation accuracy. You can find all of my work using this dataset on [github](https://github.com/rsizem2/forest-cover-type-prediction).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Global variables for testing changes to this notebook quickly\nRANDOM_SEED = 0\nNUM_FOLDS = 12","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-04T22:12:41.111663Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-04T22:12:41.112172Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-04T22:12:41.140204Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-04T22:12:41.112052Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-04T22:12:41.139424Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Setup\n\n## 1.

(Very Rubbly) — Stones or boulders appear to be nearly continuous and cover 50 percent or more of the surface. The smallest stones are less than 0.03 meter apart; the smallest boulders are less than 0.05 meter apart. Classifiable soil is among the rock fragments, and plant growth is possible.\n\nIf no description of the surface cover is given, we give it a value of 0.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def surface_cover(input_df):\n    # Group IDs\n    no_desc = [7,8,14,15,16,17,19,20,21,23,35]\n    stony = [6,12]\n    very_stony = [2,9,18,26]\n    extremely_stony = [1,22,24,25,27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,36,37,38,39,40]\n    rubbly = [3,4,5,10,11,13]\n\n    # Create dictionary\n    surface_cover = {i:0 for i in no_desc}\n    surface_cover.update({i:1 for i in stony})\n    surface_cover.update({i:2 for i in very_stony})\n    surface_cover.update({i:3 for i in extremely_stony})\n    surface_cover.update({i:4 for i in rubbly})\n    \n    # Create Feature\n    df = input_df.copy()\n    df['Surface_Cover'] = input_df['Soil_Type'].apply(\n        lambda x: surface_cover[x]\n    )\n    return df","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-04T22:14:26.40796Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-04T22:14:26.408302Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-04T22:14:26.419838Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-04T22:14:26.408266Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-04T22:14:26.418842Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Surface Cover\ntrain = surface_cover(train)\ntest = surface_cover(test)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-04T22:14:26.421235Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-04T22:14:26.421548Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-04T22:14:26.868733Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-04T22:14:26.421514Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-04T22:14:26.867757Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 4.

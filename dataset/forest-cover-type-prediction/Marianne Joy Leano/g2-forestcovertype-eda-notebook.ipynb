In this case, `Cover_Type2` has the most range of observations compared to other classes.\n- `Hillshade_9am` and `Hillshade_Noon` are left or negatively skewed distribution where they take on max value between 200-250 index value for most observation in each class.\n- `Hillshade_3pm` has a normal distribution for all classes.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# plot bg\nsns.set_style(\"darkgrid\", {'grid.color': '.1'})\n\n# set target variable\ntarget = train['Cover_Type']\n\n# features to be compared with target variable\nfeatures = num_features.columns\n\n# loop for violin plot\nfor i in range(0, len(features)):\n    plt.subplots(figsize=(16,11))\n    sns.violinplot(data=num_features, x=target, y=features[i])\n    plt.xticks(size=14)\n    plt.yticks(size=14)\n    plt.xlabel('Forest Cover Types', size=18)\n    plt.ylabel(features[i], size=18)\n    \n    plt.show()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":false,"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-28T23:08:36.495847Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-28T23:08:36.496204Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-28T23:08:40.673193Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-28T23:08:36.496165Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-28T23:08:40.6726Z"},"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Violin Plot 4.2 Wilderness Area Inferences:\n- `Wilderness_Area1` belongs to forest `Cover_Type1`, `Cover_Type2`, and `Cover_Type5`.\n- `Wilderness_Area3` belongs to all classes except `Cover_Type4`.\n- `Wilderness_Area2` and `Wilderness_Area4` has the least observations, their dense is less on 1 on all classes compared to `Wilderness_Area1` and `Wilderness_Area3`.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# plot bg\nsns.set_style(\"darkgrid\", {'grid.color': '.1'})\n\n# set target variable\ntarget = train['Cover_Type']\n# features to be compared with target variable\nfeatures = wild_data.columns\n\n# loop for violin plots\nfor i in range(0, len(features)):\n    \n    plt.subplots(figsize=(13,9))\n    sns.violinplot(data=wild_data, x=target, y=features[i])\n    plt.xticks(size=14)\n    plt.yticks(size=14)\n    plt.xlabel('Forest Cover Types', size=16)\n    plt.ylabel(features[i], size=16)\n    \n    plt.show()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-28T23:08:40.674276Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-28T23:08:40.674912Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-28T23:08:41.989438Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-28T23:08:40.674882Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-28T23:08:41.988525Z"},"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Violin Plot 4.3 Soil Type Inferences:\n- `Soil_Type4` is the only soil type that has presence in all forest cover types.\n- `Soil_Type`: 7 and 15 visually, have little to no presence in all forest cover types.\n- `Soil_Type`: 3 and 6 has presence in `Cover_Type`: 2, 3, 4, 6\n- `Soil_Type`: 10, 11, 16, and 17 and has presence in `Cover_Type` 1 thru 6.\n- `Soil_Type`: 23, 24, 31 and 33 has presence in `Cover_Type`: 1, 2, 5, 6, 7.\n- `Soil_Type`: 29 and 30, has presence in `Cover_Type`: 1, 2, 5, 7.\n- `Soil_Type`: 22, 27, 35, 38, 39, and 40 has presence in `Cover_Type`: 1, 2, and 7.\n- `Soil_Type`: 18 and 28 has presence in `Cover_Type`: 2 and 5.\n- `Soil_Type`: 19 and 26 has presence in `Cover_Type`: 1, 2, and 5.\n- `Soil_Type`: 8 and 25 has presence in only `Cover_Type2`.\n- `Soil_Type`: 1, 5, and 14 has presence in `Cover_Type`: 3, 4, and 6.\n- `Soil_Type37` has presence in `Cover_Type7`.\n\n\n- `Cover_Type4` has the least amount of `Soil_Type` count.\n- `Cover_Type2` has the most presence in `Soil_Type` count.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# plot bg\nsns.set_style(\"darkgrid\", {'grid.color':'.1'})\n\n# set target variable\ntarget = train['Cover_Type']\n# features compare with target variable\nfeatures = soil_data.columns\n\n# violin for loop\nfor i in range(0, len(features)):\n    plt.subplots(figsize=(13,9))\n    sns.violinplot(data=soil_data, x=target, y=features[i])\n    plt.xticks(size=14)\n    plt.yticks(size=14)\n    plt.xlabel('Forest Cover Types', size=16)\n    plt.ylabel(features[i], size=16)\n    \n    plt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-28T23:08:41.990959Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-28T23:08:41.991522Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-28T23:08:54.820439Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-28T23:08:41.991478Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-28T23:08:54.819566Z"},"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Feature Correlation\nPart of our data is binary.

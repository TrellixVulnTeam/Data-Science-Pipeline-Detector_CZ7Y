We are looking for a yes/no answer, 0 or 1 gives us that binary response\n\nBefore we go on, it is worth pointing out, from a mathematical position, where the name logistic regression comes from. Quick, I'll put the linear regression formula.\n\n$\\large y = \\beta_{0}+\\beta_{1}X $\n\nI hope you see it.

It is important to note here what odds is *not*. Odds is not saying that your chance is 2/3. Instead, it is saying that that you will, probabilistically, arrive at answer X 2 times out of 5 and answer Y 3 times out of 5.\n\n\nThink about it this way. An odds of 1:1 would just be...50% probability, right? If you ever get confused, just remember the odds of 1:1 and then work your interpretation from there.\n\nBut, of course, that isn't it with odds. You still have to add the logarithm (this is essentially done to make everything easier and to get rid of the intercept, slope, & x being in the exponential).\n\n\nNow the question is, how on earth do we use this? Well, it ends up being pretty simple here. Once you have all the more complicated stuff out of the way, then you check on your probability switch. What I mean by that is that you decide what your decision boundary is for moving your outputs to 0 or 1.\n\nFor this modeling practice, we won't mess with that, it'll remain at a 50% probability for our decision line.

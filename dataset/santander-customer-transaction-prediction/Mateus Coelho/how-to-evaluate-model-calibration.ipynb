Analysts would use it as a yes/no decider or as a probability estimator? Knowing this information and using it to deliver good business solutions is essencial. Also, choosing an evaluation metric that's adjusted to the optimization your company wants to have is important. For example, evaluating a fraud detection model with accuracy is not recommended.\n\nIn this notebook I want to touch in the second possibility raised before, that is, when our model will be used as a probability estimator. I will present an example using a real competition data set and point out reading resources to further understand the topics covered here.  \n\n# Importing libs and reading data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Libs to deal with tabular data\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Plotting libs\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Machine learning\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.calibration import CalibratedClassifierCV, calibration_curve\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\n# Auxiliar libs\nfrom tqdm import tqdm_notebook as tqdm\nimport os\nimport time\nfrom math import ceil\nfrom IPython.display import display, Markdown","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-20T20:04:59.934137Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-20T20:04:59.934781Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-20T20:04:59.940276Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-20T20:04:59.934729Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-20T20:04:59.939568Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Reading train split\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/santander-customer-transaction-prediction/train.csv')\nX = train.drop(['ID_code', 'target'], axis=1).values\ny = train['target'].values","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-20T20:05:00.509482Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-20T20:05:00.510058Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-20T20:05:08.581486Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-20T20:05:00.510007Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-20T20:05:08.580426Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Picking an evaluation metric\n\nThe data set used as an example is taken from a Kaggle competition called Santander Customer Transaction Prediction.

Accuracy is not recommended because even if we always predict 0, the accuracy will be 90%. Besides, it doesn't take into account the influence of false positives and false negatives as F-score does.\n\nIn this problem I will use the area under the ROC curve. It ranges from 0 to 1 and higher values mean better models. The main advantage of using AUROC is that it can easily assess if the probabilities yielded by the model are ordered correctly. In other words, it answer the following question: what's the probability of a positive case have a probability greater than the probability of a negative case? For example, an AUC of 0.8 tells us that if we randomly pick a positive case, its probability will be on average greater than the probability of 80% of the negative cases.\n\nRemember that we want a model that estimates probabilities. F1-score is not good choice because it needs the specification of a threshold.\n\nIf you want to get a better understanding of AUC and how it's computed, the blog Analytics Revolution made a great two-post series diving into this subject:\n\n- First post: [ROC Curves in two lines of code](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2016/08/roc-curves-in-two-lines-of-code.html)\n- Second post: [Calculating AUC: the area under a ROC Curve](https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2016/11/calculating-auc.html/)\n\n# Calibration curves (reliability diagram)\n\nCalibration is another important concept to understand when evaluating probabilities yielded by a model. A model is called calibrated when the probabilities estimated resemble the real frequency of positive cases. For example, if we take a sample of 100 cases scored by the model whose mean probability of being positive is 60%, then we expect the real rate of positive cases in this sample to be 60%. Calibration is an important characteristic to have in credit scoring models, for instance.\n\nTo assess the calibration, one can use a type of chart called calibration curve. To build it, use the following steps:\n\n1. Score the test set and sort the probabilities by increasing order.\n2. Divide the test set in a number of bins with equal probability width.\n3. For each bin, compute the mean probability outputed by the model and the true rate of positive cases.\n4. Plot a graph where x-axis is the mean probability outputed and the y-axis is the rate of positive cases. Then, each bin corresponds to a dot in this graph.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anand_Avati/publication/321160854/figure/download/fig2/AS:562618466344960@1511150103061/Reliability-curve-calibration-plot-of-the-model-output-probabilities-on-the-test-set.png\" width=\"500\"/>\n\nFor example, in the calibration curve above we can see that the model curve is very close to the diagonal line. The perfectly calibrated model will have a diagonal curve because in all segments of probability the mean predicted value will be equal to the true fraction of positives.\n\nIf you want to see more examples and have a better understanding of model calibration, check [this article](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/calibration.htmlhttps://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/calibration.html) from the scikit-learn documentation.\n\nNotice that's possible to adopt other strategies to define the bins. We could, for instance, use bins with equal number of samples. In some cases, some regions of the probability space have a small number of samples, so that it's hard to evaluate if the model is really calibrated. If we are dealing with a very imbalanced binary-classification, it's really hard to have good calibrated probabilities in the high end probability range.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Expected calibration error (ECE)\n\nInstead of visually analyzing the calibration we can use the metric ECE.

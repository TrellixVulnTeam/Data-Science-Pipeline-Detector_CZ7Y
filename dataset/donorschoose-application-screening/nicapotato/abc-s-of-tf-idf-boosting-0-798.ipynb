Thus, the default setting does not ignore any terms.\n\nmin_df is used for removing terms that appear too infrequently. For example:\n- **min_df** = 0.01 means \"ignore terms that appear in less than 1% of the documents\".\n- **min_d*f** = 5 means \"ignore terms that appear in less than 5 documents\".\nThe default min_df is 1, which means \"ignore terms that appear in less than 1 document\".

Check it out!\n***\n## Model Paradigm:\n**Decision Trees:** <br>\nI like to think of decision trees as optimizing a series of “If/Then” statements, eventually assigning the value at the tree’s terminal node. Starting from one point at the top, features can then pass the various trials until being assigned its class at the end “leaf” nodes of the tree (technically, it's more like its root tip since the end nodes are visually represented at the bottom of the graph). Trees used here are binary trees, so nodes can only split into two ways.\n\n**Gradient Boosting:** <br>\nAs the name suggest, Gradient Boosting iteratively trains models sequentially to minimize its objective function. This is a Greedy Algorithm, which makes the most favorable split when it can. This means it's short sighted and will also stop when the loss doesn’t improve.\n\n**XGBoost - eXtreme Gradient Boosting: ** <br>\nAs the name suggest, Gradient Boosting on steroids. Infact, multiple steroids:\n- **Regularization**\n- **Computation Speed** and **Parallel Processing**\n- Handles **Missing Values**\n- Improves on Gradient Boosting ***'Greedy'*** tendencies. It does this by considering reaching the max depth and retroactively pruning \n- **Interruptible** and **Resumable**, as well as **Hadoop** capabilities.\n\nXGBoost is able to approximate the Loss function more efficiently, thereby leading to faster computation and parallel processing. Inside its objective function, it has also incorporated a regularization term, L1 and L2, to stay clear of unnecessary high dimensional spaces and complexity.\n\n## Hyper-Parameters:\n*Some of these parameter names are from the sklearn terminology, other from XGBOOST and Light GBM.. I try to include their various aliases. The main purpose of this guide is for conceptual understanding.* <br>\n\n**General Decision Tree Hyper-Parameters:** <br>\n- **max_features:** This is the random subset of features to be considered for splitting operation, the lower the better to reduce variance. For Classification model, ideal max_features = sqr(n_var).\n- **max_depth:** Maximum depth of the tree. Alternate method of control model depth is max_leaf_nodes, which limits the number of terminal nodes, effectively limiting the depth of the tree.\n- **n_estimators:** Number of trees built before average prediction is made.\n- **min_samples_split:** Minimum number of samples required for a node to be split. Small minimum would potentially lead to a “Bushy Tree”, prone to overfitting. According to Analytic Vidhya, should be around 0.5~1% of the datasize.\n- **min_samples_leaf:** Minimum number of samples required at the Terminal Node of the tree. In Sklearn, an alternative min_weight_fraction_leaf is available to use fraction of the data instead of a fixed integer.\n- **random_state:** Ensuring consistent random generation, like seed(). Important to consider for comparing models of the same type to ensure a fair comparison. May cause overfitting if random generation is not representative.\n\n**Gradient Boosting Specific Hyper-Parameters:** <br>\n- **eta/learning_rate: ** How much parameters are updated after each iteration of gradient descent. Low mean smaller steps, most likely to reach the global minimum, although there are cases where this doesn’t always work as intended.\n- **n_estimators/num_iterations:** Note this is still the number of trees being built, but it within the GBC’s sequential methodology.\n- **subsample:** Similar to the Bootstrap Aggregate method, controlling percentage of data utilized for a tree, although the standard is to sample *without* replacement. In this model, operates in similar ways to Stochastic Gradient Descent in Neural Networks, but with large batch sizes. <br>\n*Note this decision trees are still a *Shallow Model*, so it is still profoundly different from Neural Networks.*\n- **loss:** Objective Function minimized by gradient descent.\n- **init:** Initialization of the model internal parameters. May be used to build off another model's’ outcome.\n\n**Hyper-Parameters for Tree Classification Booster (Sklearn Wrapper):** <br>\n- **min_child_leaf / min_data_in_leaf :** Controls the minimum number of observation to split to a terminal node. \n- **Min_child_weight / min_sum_hessian_in_leaf:** Similar strand to *min_child_leaf*. This instead relates to defines the minimum sum of derivatives found in the Hessian (second-order)of all observations required in a child.\n- **Gamma / min_gain_to_split:** Node is split only if it gives a positive decrease in the loss function. Higher performance regulator of complexity.\n- **Max_delta_step:** What the tree’s weights can be.\n- **Colsample_bylevel/ feature_fraction:** Random Forest characteristic, where it enables subfraction of features to be randomly selected for each tree.\n\n**Regularization:** <br>\nIn the context of GBMs, regularization through shrinkage is available, but applying it to the model with the tree base-learner is different from its traditional coefficient constriction. For GBM Trees, the shrinking decreases the influence of each additional tree in the iterative process, effectively applying a decay of impact over boosting rounds. As a result, it no longer searches as the feature selection method, since it cannot adjust the coefficients of each feature (and potential interaction/ polynomial terms).\n\n**Learning Task Parameters:**\n- **Objective:** *binary:logistic* = Outputs probability for two classes.\n- **Multi:** *softmax* = outputs prediction for *num_class* classes.\n- **Multi:** *prob* = probability for 3 or more classes.\n\nThe objective is merely a matter of catering to the data type, although additional protocols on the probabilities may be set up. For example, the highest probability below a certain threshold may be deemed an inadequate score, passed over for human processing. The optimal loss function should cater to the behavior of the data and goal at hand, and usually requires input from the domain knowledge base.\n\nThe **Evaluation Metric** (*eval_metric*) has important implications depending on the problem at hand. If the dataset is imbalanced and the minority class is of interest, it is better to use [AUC] Area Under the Curve than accuracy or rmse, since those metrics can get away with assigning the majority class to all, and still get away with high accuracy!\n\n*More Info:* <br>\n- [Complete Guide to Parameter Tuning in Gradient Boosting (GBM) in Python by Analytics Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/02/complete-guide-parameter-tuning-gradient-boosting-gbm-python/) \n- [Gradient boosting machines, a tutorial by Alexey Natekin1 and Alois Knoll](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3885826/)\n- [Complete Guide to XGBOOST with Analytic Vidhya](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/03/complete-guide-parameter-tuning-xgboost-with-codes-python/)\n- [Python Installation Instructions](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/jfp/entry/Installing_XGBoost_For_Anaconda_on_Windows?lang=en)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"f35a6750867b89e3620f6b22bd0f34ae9fdfe7fc","_cell_guid":"e0693a65-8a6b-4f4c-976b-76daa72db6f5","collapsed":true,"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"xgb_params = {'eta': 0.05, \n              'max_depth': 12, \n              'subsample': 0.8, \n              'colsample_bytree': 0.75,\n              #'min_child_weight' : 1.5,\n              'scale_pos_weight': imbalance_weight,\n              'objective': 'binary:logistic', \n              'eval_metric': 'auc', \n              'seed': 23,\n              'lambda': 1.5,\n              'alpha': .6\n             }","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ec7256297133ebbe9d4f5b26452a335a1d238142","_cell_guid":"3ebaef30-e26f-4b12-8bd2-7297c9821e96","trusted":false,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"modelstart = time.time()\nwatchlist = [(d_train, 'train'), (d_valid, 'valid')]\nmodel = xgb.train(xgb_params, d_train, 2000, watchlist, verbose_eval=50, early_stopping_rounds=50)\nxgb_pred = model.predict(d_test)\n\nxgb_sub = pd.DataFrame(xgb_pred,columns=[\"project_is_approved\"],index=tesdex)\nxgb_sub.to_csv(\"xgb_sub.csv\",index=True)\nprint(\"Model Runtime: %0.2f Minutes\"%((time.time() - modelstart)/60))\n\ndel d_train, d_valid, d_test\ngc.collect();","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"738662598a88fd72f3c0bde380ca9ee20bb0c96f","_cell_guid":"f07e0c9d-a4ae-439c-8330-75415fe86165"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"*Reflection on Parameters:* <br>\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"18c6c54ac566fa434c1d28790f78bbc1cbabc26c","_cell_guid":"dafdbe5f-fc90-42df-b847-bb0c5bbf4bd8"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Model Interpretation-**<br>\n*Introducing the Feature Importance Bar Plot:* <br>\nSince each split in the decision tree distinguishes the dependent variable, splits closer to the root, aka starting point, have optimally been determined to have the greatest splitting effect.

LightGBM's originally had a 10x speed advantage over XGBOOST when it pioneered the histogram binning of feature values. Now XGBOOST has also implemented this technique and is only 6x slower now.\n\nLGBM grows **Leaf-Wise** instead of **Level-Wise**, which means that its builds until reaching a terminal node, then continues to find terminal node with the second best amount of importance.\n\n**Light GBM Hyperparameters:** <br>\n- **Bagging_fraction / Bagginng_freq:** Bagging is the process of sampling observations without replacement. This means that the same observation may occur multiple times. *Bagging_fraction* signifies the portion of the data selected for sampling, and *Bagging_freq* refers to the iteration interval to conduct bagging. This method is utilized to reduce over-fitting.\n- **Max_depth / num_leaves:** This controls the amount of *\"Bushiness\"*. Max_depths refers to the maximum number of levels permited,  and num_leaves refers to the maximum number of terminal nodes. \n- **is_unbalance / scale_pos_weight**: Enables the model to deal with an imbalanced dependent variable.\n- **max_bin:** Since LGBM uses histogram binning, this parameters refers to the number of bins created. The less bins there are, the faster the algorithm runs.. at the cost of accuracy.\n\n*Note on Reproducibility:* <br>\nSince there are alot of randomly generated aspects of this model building, I recommended looking deeper into the [documentation](http://testlightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Parameters.html) to find additional parameters such as *bagging_seed, feature_fraction_seed* and keeping them fixed.\n\n**Reading Resourced:**\n- [LGBM Features](https://github.com/Microsoft/LightGBM/blob/master/docs/Features.rst)\n- [DART](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.01866.pdf)\n- [Parameters](http://testlightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Parameters.html)\n- [Light GBM Paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/6907-lightgbm-a-highly-efficient-gradient-boosting-decision-tree.pdf)\n\n"},{"metadata":{"scrolled":false,"_cell_guid":"f2cbf632-72e0-40fc-8c89-221618546bbf","_uuid":"ad18d28bfec4841c918d7a9510ed06fa8308055b","trusted":false,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"lgbm_params = {\n    'boosting_type': 'gbdt',\n    'objective': 'binary',\n    'metric': 'auc',\n    'max_depth': 35,\n    #'num_leaves': 500,\n    'learning_rate': 0.01,\n    'feature_fraction': 0.80,\n    'bagging_fraction': 0.80,\n    'bagging_freq': 5,\n    'max_bin':300,\n    #'verbose': 0,\n    #'num_threads': 1,\n    'lambda_l2': 1.5,\n    #'min_gain_to_split': 0,\n    'is_unbalance': True\n    #'scale_pos_weight':0.15\n}  \n\n# LGBM dataset\nlgtrain = lgb.Dataset(X_train, y_train,\n                feature_name=tfvocab,\n                categorical_feature = categorical_features)\nlgvalid = lgb.Dataset(X_valid, y_valid,\n                feature_name=tfvocab,\n                categorical_feature = categorical_features)\n\nmodelstart = time.time()\nlgb_clf = lgb.train(\n    lgbm_params,\n    lgtrain,\n    num_boost_round=2000,\n    valid_sets=[lgtrain, lgvalid],\n    valid_names=['train','valid'],\n    early_stopping_rounds=50,\n    verbose_eval=150\n)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"65471315b3947eb79d3f005bcf45210d85f001e0","_cell_guid":"f71be493-fd94-429a-9b3f-a56ba0696f08","trusted":false,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"lgbmpred = lgb_clf.predict(testing)\nlgbm_sub = pd.DataFrame(lgbmpred,columns=[\"project_is_approved\"],index=tesdex)\nlgbm_sub.to_csv(\"lgbm_sub.csv\",index=True)\nprint(\"Model Runtime: %0.2f Minutes\"%((time.time() - modelstart)/60))\ndel lgvalid, lgtrain\ngc.collect();","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"b561fa7e647aca82c2ed518cd13aef1be2dcb840","_cell_guid":"bfe758de-9110-4548-b362-4929ec292384"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"*Reflection on Parameters:* <br>\nThere is a sizable difference between the train and validation accuracy.

But so many of them focus on the technical aspects - how to write a model, how to use a tool. You only see the final kernel, running like a well-architected piece of software.\n\nBut we all know Data Science doesn't work like that. You get a dataset, you poke at it, try things, go back and revisit your assumptions. This kernel is an attempt to document all that - to show what I'm thinking as I run code, to preserve the failed experiments and the sidetracks. I'm not going to keep cells with syntax errors, but other than that - let's start on this journey!"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"e07e5fa301605c3b08980028d14e15ed203281e1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There's a few standard packages to load.

Interesting to note that for that one, the quantity isn't really accurate - it's a 30-student kit. Number of licenses could also be something reported either in the quantity or in the description.

I want to run a basic model and verify that the accuracy that I see in this kernel is the same as I get when I submit to the leaderboard. This is especially critical in a dataset like this, since the \"resources\" file has both train and test info and is a prime way that information might leak.

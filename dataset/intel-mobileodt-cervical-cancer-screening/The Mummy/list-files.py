# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.image as mpimage

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

from subprocess import check_output
#print(check_output(["ls", "../input/train/Type_1"]).decode("utf8"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

img = mpimage.imread('../input/train/Type_1/0.jpg')
plt.imshow(img)

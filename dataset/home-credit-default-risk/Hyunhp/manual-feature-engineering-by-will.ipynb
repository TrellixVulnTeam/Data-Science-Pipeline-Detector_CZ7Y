In an earlier notebook, we used only the application data in order to build a model. The best model we made from this data achieved a score on the leaderboard around 0.74. In order to better this score, we will have to include more information from the other dataframes. Here, we will look at using information from the bureau and bureau_balance data. The definitions of these data files are:\n\n* bureau: information about client's previous loans with other financial institutions reported to Home Credit. Each previous loan has its own row.\n* bureau_balance: monthly information about the previous loans. Each month has its own row.\n\nManual feature engineering can be a tedious process (which is why we use automated feature engineering with featuretools!) and often relies on domain expertise. Since I have limited domain knowledge of loans and what makes a person likely to default, I will instead concentrate of getting as much info as possible into the final training dataframe. The idea is that the model will then pick up on which features are important rather than us having to decide that. Basically, our approach is to make as many features as possible and then give them all to the model to use! Later, we can perform feature reduction using the feature importances from the model or other techniques such as PCA.\n\nThe process of manual feature engineering will involve plenty of Pandas code, a little patience, and a lot of great practice manipulation data. Even though automated feature engineering tools are starting to be made available, feature engineering will still have to be done using plenty of data wrangling for a little while longer.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# pandas and numpy for data manipulation\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# matplotlib and seaborn for plotting\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# suppress warnings from pandas\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\nplt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-21T11:14:25.982567Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-21T11:14:25.982958Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-21T11:14:26.893853Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-21T11:14:25.982874Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-21T11:14:26.892717Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Example: Counts of a client's previous loans\n\nTo illustrate the general process of manual feature engineering, we will first simply get the count of a client's previous loans at other financial institutions. This requires a number of Pandas operations we will make heavy use of throughout the notebook:\n\n* groupby: group a dataframe by a column. In this case we will group by the unique client, the SK_ID_CURR column\n* agg: perform a calculation on the grouped data such as taking the mean of columns. We can either call the function directly (grouped_df.mean()) or use the agg function together with a list of transforms (grouped_df.agg([mean, max, min, sum]))\n* merge: match the aggregated statistics to the appropriate client. We need to merge the original training data with the calculated stats on the SK_ID_CURR column which will insert NaN in any cell for which the client does not have the corresponding statistic\nWe also use the (rename) function quite a bit specifying the columns to be renamed as a dictionary. This is useful in order to keep track of the new variables we create.\n\nThis might seem like a lot, which is why we'll eventually write a function to do this process for us.

The r-value is not best measure of the \"usefulness\" of a new variable, but it can give a first approximation of whether a variable will be helpful to a machine learning model. The larger the r-value of a variable with respect to the target, the more a change in this variable is likely to affect the value of the target.

To see the different in distributions dependent on the value of a categorical variable, we can color the distributions differently according to the category. For example, we can show the kernel density estimate of the previous_loan_count colored by whether the TARGET = 1 or 0. The resulting KDE will show any significant differences in the distribution of the variable between people who did not repay their loan (TARGET == 1) and the people who did (TARGET == 0).

Feature Engineering Outcomes\nAfter all that work, now we want to take a look at the variables we have created. We can look at the percentage of missing values, the correlations of variables with the target, and also the correlation of variables with the other variables. The correlations between variables can show if we have collinear varibles, that is, variables that are highly correlated with one another. Often, we want to remove one in a pair of collinear variables because having both variables would be redundant. We can also use the percentage of missing values to remove features with a substantial majority of values that are not present. Feature selection will be an important focus going forward, because reducing the number of features can help the model learn during training and also generalize better to the testing data. The \"curse of dimensionality\" is the name given to the issues caused by having too many features (too high of a dimension). As the number of variables increases, the number of datapoints needed to learn the relationship between these variables and the target value increases exponentially.\n\nFeature selection is the process of removing variables to help our model to learn and generalize better to the testing set. The objective is to remove useless/redundant variables while preserving those that are useful. There are a number of tools we can use for this process, but in this notebook we will stick to removing columns with a high percentage of missing values and variables that have a high correlation with one another. Later we can look at using the feature importances returned from models such as the Gradient Boosting Machine or Random Forest to perform feature selection.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Missing Values\nAn important consideration is the missing values in the dataframe.

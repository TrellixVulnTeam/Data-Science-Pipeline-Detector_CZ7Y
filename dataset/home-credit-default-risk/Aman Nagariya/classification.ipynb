A machine learning model unfortunately cannot deal with categorical variables (except for some models such as LightGBM). Therefore, we have to find a way to encode (represent) these variables as numbers before handing them off to the model. There are two main ways to carry out this process:\n\n****Label encoding****: assign each unique category in a categorical variable with an integer. No new columns are created. \n****One-hot encoding****: create a new column for each unique category in a categorical variable. Each observation recieves a 1 in the column for its corresponding category and a 0 in all other new columns.\n\n\nThe problem with label encoding is that it gives the categories an arbitrary ordering. The value assigned to each of the categories is random and does not reflect any inherent aspect of the category. In the example above, programmer recieves a 4 and data scientist a 1, but if we did the same process again, the labels could be reversed or completely different. The actual assignment of the integers is arbitrary. Therefore, when we perform label encoding, the model might use the relative value of the feature (for example programmer = 4 and data scientist = 1) to assign weights which is not what we want. If we only have two unique values for a categorical variable (such as Male/Female), then label encoding is fine, but for more than 2 unique categories, one-hot encoding is the safe option.\n\nThere is some debate about the relative merits of these approaches, and some models can deal with label encoded categorical variables with no issues. Here is a good Stack Overflow discussion. I think (and this is just a personal opinion) for categorical variables with many classes, one-hot encoding is the safest approach because it does not impose arbitrary values to categories. The only downside to one-hot encoding is that the number of features (dimensions of the data) can explode with categorical variables with many categories. To deal with this, we can perform one-hot encoding followed by PCA or other dimensionality reduction methods to reduce the number of dimensions (while still trying to preserve information).\n\nIn this notebook, we will use Label Encoding for any categorical variables with only 2 categories and One-Hot Encoding for any categorical variables with more than 2 categories. This process may need to change as we get further into the project, but for now, we will see where this gets us. (We will also not use any dimensionality reduction in this notebook but will explore in future iterations).\n\nLabel Encoding and One-Hot Encoding\nLet's implement the policy described above: for any categorical variable (dtype == object) with 2 unique categories, we will use label encoding, and for any categorical variable with more than 2 unique categories, we will use one-hot encoding.\n\nFor label encoding, we use the Scikit-Learn LabelEncoder and for one-hot encoding, the pandas get_dummies(df) function."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"40ba1d0062d903dfabdb58a562184f4eaecc2272"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Create a label encoder object\nle = LabelEncoder()\nle_count = 0\n\n# Iterate through the columns\nfor col in app_train:\n    if app_train[col].dtype == 'object':\n        # If 2 or fewer unique categories\n        if len(list(app_train[col].unique())) <= 2:\n            # Train on the training data\n            le.fit(app_train[col])\n            # Transform both training and testing data\n            app_train[col] = le.transform(app_train[col])\n            app_test[col] = le.transform(app_test[col])\n            \n            # Keep track of how many columns were label encoded\n            le_count += 1\n            \nprint('%d columns were label encoded.' % le_count)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"69ea556369c0cca1c550b38f5e15577afdfffc16"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# one-hot encoding of categorical variables\napp_train = pd.get_dummies(app_train)\napp_test = pd.get_dummies(app_test)\n\nprint('Training Features shape: ', app_train.shape)\nprint('Testing Features shape: ', app_test.shape)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"16001840c9240bcad9833aca9e2a0c0ce5578263"},"cell_type":"code","source":"app_train.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"5e4737cc21600fa9f4ce894c32b1ef4e99089650"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Aligning Training and Testing Data\n\nThere need to be the same features (columns) in both the training and testing data.

Making sure this data is as relevant to the task as possible is the job of the data scientist (and maybe some automated tools to help us out).\n\nFeature engineering refers to a geneal process and can involve both feature construction: adding new features from the existing data, and feature selection: choosing only the most important features or other methods of dimensionality reduction. There are many techniques we can use to both create features and select features.\n\nWe will do a lot of feature engineering when we start using the other data sources, but in this notebook we will try only two simple feature construction methods:\n\n* Polynomial features\n* Domain knowledge features\n\n**1. Polynomial Features**\n\nOne simple feature construction method is called polynomial features. In this method, we make features that are powers of existing features as well as interaction terms between existing features. For example, we can create variables EXT_SOURCE_1^2 and EXT_SOURCE_2^2 and also variables such as EXT_SOURCE_1 x EXT_SOURCE_2, EXT_SOURCE_1 x EXT_SOURCE_2^2, EXT_SOURCE_1^2 x  EXT_SOURCE_2^2, and so on. These features that are a combination of multiple individual variables are called interaction terms because they capture the interactions between variables. In other words, while two variables by themselves may not have a strong influence on the target, combining them together into a single interaction variable might show a relationship with the target. Interaction terms are commonly used in statistical models to capture the effects of multiple variables, but I do not see them used as often in machine learning. Nonetheless, we can try out a few to see if they might help our model to predict whether or not a client will repay a loan.\n\nJake VanderPlas writes about polynomial features in his excellent book Python for Data Science for those who want more information.\n\nIn the following code, we create polynomial features using the EXT_SOURCE variables and the DAYS_BIRTH variable. Scikit-Learn has a useful class called PolynomialFeatures that creates the polynomials and the interaction terms up to a specified degree. We can use a degree of 3 to see the results (when we are creating polynomial features, we want to avoid using too high of a degree, both because the number of features scales exponentially with the degree, and because we can run into problems with overfitting)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"d15ce120052ff77cd4700367c551b1680bd3db1e"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Make a new dataframe for polynomial features\npoly_features = app_train[['EXT_SOURCE_1', 'EXT_SOURCE_2', 'EXT_SOURCE_3', 'DAYS_BIRTH', 'TARGET']]\npoly_features_test = app_test[['EXT_SOURCE_1', 'EXT_SOURCE_2', 'EXT_SOURCE_3', 'DAYS_BIRTH']]\n\n# imputer for handling missing values\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import Imputer\nimputer = Imputer(strategy = 'median')\n\npoly_target = poly_features['TARGET']\n\npoly_features = poly_features.drop(columns = ['TARGET'])\n\n# Need to impute missing values\npoly_features = imputer.fit_transform(poly_features)\npoly_features_test = imputer.transform(poly_features_test)\n\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures\n                                  \n# Create the polynomial object with specified degree\npoly_transformer = PolynomialFeatures(degree = 3)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"be12b38ec73dae9a89c065d00f2dcd2bae69e1c4"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Train the polynomial features\npoly_transformer.fit(poly_features)\n\n# Transform the features\npoly_features = poly_transformer.transform(poly_features)\npoly_features_test = poly_transformer.transform(poly_features_test)\nprint('Polynomial Features shape: ', poly_features.shape)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"6c698fc74bd1097b0b57ebb28a95d482eb15de30"},"cell_type":"code","source":"poly_transformer.get_feature_names(input_features = ['EXT_SOURCE_1','EXT_SOURCE_2', 'EXT_SOURCE_3', 'DAYS_BIRTH'])[:16]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"559e0ed2aeec7c4aa8414018d9c6b028a7f34752"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are 35 features with individual features raised to powers up to degree 3 and interaction terms.

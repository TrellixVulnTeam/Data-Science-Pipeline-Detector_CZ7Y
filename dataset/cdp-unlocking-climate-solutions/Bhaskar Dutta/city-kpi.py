# For example, here's several helpful packages to load

import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the read-only "../input/" directory
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using "Save & Run All" 
# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session

"A programmatic monitoring and evaluation system of climate change adaptation plans, programs, projects, and activities are encapsulated in budget preparation documents for each fiscal cycle. This pertains to tagging projects as either climate mitigation or adaptation actions under the Climate Change Expenditure Tagging as indicated under existing Philippine laws and regulations. Each budgetary form indicates major final outputs and key performance indicators which will measure the degree of success of the planned initiative.Quezon City's Local Climate Change Action Plan (LCCAP) 2017-2027 is also set up with the following systems:Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ collecting and recording the information;Ã¢â‚¬Â¢ analysing the information; andÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ using information to inform decision makersChapter 7 of the Local Climate Change Action Plan (LCCAP) 2017-2027 deals with the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) as a very significant feature of the QC-LCCAP 2017-2027. The chapter describes how the Quezon City CWG aimed at learning from the activities done during the preparation of the QC-LCCAP 2017-2027, (i.e. what was done and how it was done) as the QC-LCCAP 2017-2027 is a long term plan, the strategies have the tendency to be changed/revised depending if the strategies and corresponding Programs, Projects, and Activities (PPAs) are working or not. This chapter also explains how the completion of these projects will become the indication for the Quezon City Local GovernmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s decision makers about when the plans are working, and when the environment changed, and how the plans can be revised with the changing environment"]

Why?\n*I did the former because it's more suitable for the email notification systome, however if I turn around the query it can recommend unanswered questions for a given professional real time.*\nDoes your model address the \"cold start\" problem for Professionals who just signed up but have not yet answered any questions? How'd you approach that challenge?\n*Not directly, however witht the Graph database and the Cypher query language it could be solved by Jaccard score and closeness in the graph*\nDid your model have any novel approaches to ensuring that \"no question gets left behind\"?\n*The unanswered questions could be queried real time to build a burn down board for the CV site.*\nWhat types of models did you try, and why did you pick the model architecture that you picked?\nI considered a few approaches (ML, NLP, networkx, Neo4j), but the Neo4j graph approach turned out the best for the current tactical needs and future strategis directions\nDid you engineer any new data features? Which ones worked well for your model?\nThe Jaccard score was great to find out similar questions, with more tags (for NLP or from users) it could be even more precise.\nIs there anything built into your approach to protect certain Professionals from being \"overburdened\" with a disproportionately high share of matches?\n*No, but it could be done easily by a query builded into the recommendation system.*\nWhat do you wish you could use in the future (that perhaps we could try out on our own as an extension of your work)?\n*The graph based link predicton ML approach, the book got out a few

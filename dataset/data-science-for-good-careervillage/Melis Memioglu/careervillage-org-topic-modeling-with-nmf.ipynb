In this task, token types of nouns, adjectives and verbs are considered.</li>\n    <li> <b>Lemmatization: </b>Tokens are lemmatized according to their PoS tags, which brings the tokens to their dictionary form. For example, postfixes (e.g. plural forms) are stripped out.</li>\n    <li> <b>Removing short tokens: </b>Tokens which are shorter than 3 characters are filtered out.</li>\n    <li> <b>Removing stopwords: </b>Stopwords are removed. For this step, stopwords from SpaCy and NLTK are merged. NLTK removes modal verbs and articles successfully, however SpaCy includes pronouns, such as \"something\" and \"someone\", as well. Moreover, there are certain words, which appear in most of the questions, regardless of the topic, such as \"college\", \"school\", \"career\" and \"interested\". They do not imply any special topic and confuse the model, as they appear often in questions of diverse topics. Therefore, 30 most commen tokens are found and added as stopwords. Moreover, 25 most common nouns and adjectives, as listed on Wikipedia) are also added to the stopwords set.</li>\n    <li> <b>Stemming: </b>As the last step, stemming with Snowball English will be performed, in order to group related words together. For example, as lemmatization is done before, \"nurse\" and \"nursing\" are considered as two different words. This might lower the accuracy of the model, as those two words might be assigned to differet topics. After stemming, they both are converted into their stem \"nurs\" and are grouped together.<br><br>\n        <b>Note 1: </b>The reason why stemming is done in the last step is, so that stopwords would be removed properly. For example, the most common words added to the stopwords set include \"college\", whose stemmed version is \"colleg\". If stemming had been done before, then \"colleg\" would not be removed. Therefore lemmatization is made for a proper stopwords removal and stemming is made for a proper grouping of tokens.<br><br>\n        <b>Note 2: </b>Tags are not tokenized, as they are already in token forms.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<b>5)</b> In some generic career questions, students used tags from various categories, with the purpose of increasing the reach of their questions, which results in tokens of very different topics to be used in the same text.

{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"[CareerVillage](http://www.careervillage.org) is a question-and-answer website where underserved youth (usually high school and college students) can ask questions about college and careers, and have their questions answered by professionals in their field of interest.  It's like [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) for students with career-related questions!  The site is fantastic because it provides a platform for underserved students to get advice about careers and college, when they otherwise would not have access to guidance councelors, professionals, or any sort of network from which to ask these important questions.\n\nCurrently, Career Village recommends questions to professionals primarily based on what tags students have used to label their questions, and what tags each professional subscribes to.  In order to make professionals aware of the questions which best match their expertise, Career Village is looking to improve the way they recommend questions to professionals, and make better use of the data they have which goes beyond simple tags.  They recently hosted a [Kaggle competition](http://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-for-good-careervillage) to come up with a better recommendation system.\n\nHere we'll develop an implicit content-based filtering system for recommending questions to professionals.  Given a question-professional pair, our model will predict how likely the professional is to answer the question.  This model can then be used to determine what new (or still-unanswered) questions a professional is most likely to answer, and those questions can be sent to the professional  either via email or via their landing page on the CareerVillage site.\n\nThe model will go beyond using only tag similarity information, and also extract information from the body of the question text, the question title, as well as information about the student which asked the question and the professional who may (hopfully) be able to answer it.  We'll be using [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup) and [nltk](https://www.nltk.org) for processing the text data, [bert-as-service](https://github.com/hanxiao/bert-as-service) to create sentence and paragraph embeddings using a pre-trained [BERT language model](https://github.com/google-research/bert), and [XGBoost](https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost) to generate predictions as to how likely professionals are to answer student questions.\n\n**Outline**\n- [Loading the data](#loading-the-data)\n- [Merge tags to questions, students, and professionals](#merge-tags-to-questions-students-and-professionals)\n- [BERT Embeddings of the questions](#bert-embeddings-of-the-questions)\n- [Compute average embedding of questions each professional has answered](#compute-average-embedding-of-questions-each-professional-has-answered)\n- [Sample questions which each professional has not answered](#sample-questions-which-each-professional-has-not-answered)\n- [Cosine similarity between question embeddings and average embedding for questions professionals have answered](#cosine-similarity-between-question-embeddings-and-average-embedding-for-questions-professionals-have-answered)\n- [Extract date and time features](#extract-date-and-time-features)\n- [Jaccard similarity between question and professional tags](#jaccard-similarity-between-question-and-professional-tags)\n- [Train model to predict probability of answering](#train-model-to-predict-probability-of-answering)\n- [Conclusion](#conclusion)\n\nFirst let's load the packages we'll use:"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import subprocess\nimport re\nimport os\n\n# SciPy stack\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Sklearn\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler\nfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\nfrom sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n\n# XGBoost\nfrom xgboost import XGBClassifier\n\n# NLP\nimport html as ihtml\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nfrom nltk import tokenize\nfrom scipy.sparse import coo_matrix\n\n# Plot settings\n%config InlineBackend.figure_format = 'svg'\nCOLORS = plt.rcParams['axes.prop_cycle'].by_key()['color']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Target encoder and other utilities\n!pip install git+http://github.com/brendanhasz/dsutils.git\nfrom dsutils.encoding import TargetEncoderCV\nfrom dsutils.evaluation import metric_cv\nfrom dsutils.evaluation import permutation_importance_cv\nfrom dsutils.evaluation import plot_permutation_importance","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# BERT-as-service\n!pip install bert-serving-server\n!pip install bert-serving-client","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Loading the data\n\nThe dataset consists of a set of data tables - 15 tables in all, but we're only going to use a few in this project.  There's a table which contains information about each student who has an account on CareerVillage, another table with information about each professional with an account on the site, another table with each question that's been asked on the site, etc.\n\nThe diagram below shows each table we'll use, and how values in columns in those tables relate to each other.  For example, we can figure out what student asked a given question by looking up where the value in the `questions_author_id` column of the `questions.csv` table occurs in the `students_id` column of the `students.csv` table.

To capture information about the content of the question text, we'll use a pre-trained BERT model to generate embeddings of the text of each question.  BERT ([Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805)) is a deep neural network model which uses layers of attention networks ([Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762)) to model the next word in a sentence or paragraph given the preceeding words.  We'll take a pre-trained BERT model, pass it the text of the questions, and then use the activations of a layer near the end of the network as our features.  These features (the \"encodings\" or \"embeddings\", which I'll use interchangeably) should capture information about the content of the question, while encoding the question text into a vector of a fixed length, which our prediction algorithm requires!\n\n[Han Xiao](http://hanxiao.github.io/) has a great package called [bert-as-service](http://github.com/hanxiao/bert-as-service) which can generate embeddings using a pre-trained BERT model (fun fact: they're also one of the people behind [fashion MNIST](http://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist)).  Basically the package runs a BERT model on a server, and one can send that server requests (consisting of sentences) to generate embeddings of those sentences.\n\nNote that another valid method for generating numeric representations of text would be to use latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) topic modelling.  We could treat each question as a bag of words, use LDA to model the topics, and then use the estimated topic probability distribution for each question as our \"embedding\" for that question.  Honestly using LDA might even be a better way to capture information about the question content, because we're mostly interested in the *topic* of the question (which LDA exclusively models), rather than the semantic content (which BERT also models)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Clean the sentences\n\nBefore embedding the question title and body text, we'll first have to clean that data.

Cosine similarity measures the cosine of the angle between two points.  When the angle is near 0, the cosine similarity is near 1, and when the angle between the two points is as large as it can be (near 180), the cosine similarity is -1.  Given two embedding vectors $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$, the cosine distance is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathbf{a}^\\top \\mathbf{b}}{||\\mathbf{a}|| ~ ||\\mathbf{b}||}\n$$\n\nThere are a few other ways we could have measured the similarity between the embeddings of previously answered questions and the embedding of a new question.  Instead of just taking the mean embedding we could also account for the *spread* of the embeddings by computing the [Mahalanobis distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahalanobis_distance), which would account for the possibility that some professionals have broader expertise than others.  We could also use a model to predict whether the new question is in the set of questions the professional has answered (for example, K-nearest neighbors).

Each week, we can generate a list of new questions asked this week (though the time interval doesn't have to be a week - it could be a day, or a month, etc).  This list could also potentially include older questions which have not yet been answered.  Then, for each professional, we can use the recommendation model to generate scores for each new question-professional pair (that is, the probabilities that the professional would answer a given question).  Finally, we could then send the questions with the top K scores (say, the top 10) to that professional.\n\nAnother strategy for using the recommendation model would be to recommend *professionals* for each question.  That is, given a question, come up with the top K professionals most likely to answer it, and reccomend the question to them.  This strategy could use the exact same method as described previously (generating a list of new questions, and pairing with each professional), except we would choose the *professionals* with the top K scores for a given question (as opposed to choosing the top K questions for a given professional).  There are pros and cons to this strategy relative to the previous one.  I worry that using this strategy would simply send all the questions to the professionals who answer the most questions (because their answer probabilities are likely to be higher), and not send any questions to professionals who answer fewer questions.  This could result in a small subset of overworked professionals, and the majority of professionals not receiving any recommended questions!  On the other hand, those professionals who answer the most questions are indeed more likely to answer the questions, so perhaps it's OK to send them a larger list of questions.  I think the optimal approach would be to use the first strategy (recommend K questions to each professional), but allow each professional to set their K - that is, let professionals choose how many questions they are recommended per week.\n\nOn the other hand, using the current strategy could result in the opposite problem, where only a small subset of questions get sent to professionals.  In the long run, it may be best to view the problem not as a recommendation problem, but as an *allocation* problem.  That is, how can we allocate the questions to professionals such that the expected number of answered questions is highest?  Once we've generated the probabilities that each professional will answer each question, determining the best allocation becomes a discrete optimization problem.  However, the number of elements here is pretty large (questions and professionals).  Deterministic discrete optimization algorithms will likely be impractical (because they'll take too long to run given the large number of elements), and so metaheuristic methods like local search or evolutionary optimization would probably have to be used.\n\nThere was a lot of other data provided by CareerVillage which was not used in this model, but which could have been!  Parhaps the most important of this additional data was the data on the scores (basically the \"likes\") for each answer and question.  Instead of just predicting *whether* a professional was likely to answer a question (as we did with our implicit recommendation system), we could have predicted which questions they were most likely to give a *good* answer to, as judged by the number of \"likes\" their answers received(an *explicit* recommendation system).\n\nThe framework we created here uses a classifier to predict professional-question pairs - basically, a content-based filtering recommendation system.  However, there are other frameworks we could have used.  We could have framed the challenge as an implicit collaborative filtering problem (or even an explicit one if we attempted to predict the \"hearts\" given to professionals' answers).  I chose not to use a collaborative filtering framework because collaborative filtering suffers from the \"cold-start\" problem: it has trouble recommending users to new items.  This is because it depends on making predictions about user-item pair scores (in our case, whether professional-question pairs \"exist\" in the form of an answer) based on similarities between the query user and the scores of the query item by users similar to the query user.  Unfortunately, for this application it is especially important to recommend questions to professionals when the question has no answers yet!  So in production, more often than not there will *be* no scores of the query item by any other users when we want to be making the predictions.  Therefore, we have to use primarily the features about the users and the items to make recommendations.  Although some collaborative filtering methods can take into account the user and item features (such as neural collaborative filtering) I thought it would be best to use a framework which *only* uses the user and item features."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

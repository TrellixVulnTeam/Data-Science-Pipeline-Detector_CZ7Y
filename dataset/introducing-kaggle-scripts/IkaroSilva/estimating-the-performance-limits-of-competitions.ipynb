Key issues that are not trivial to consider include the choice of cost function to measure performance, the size the training/test sets, and the assessment of the risk of the tournament results being either too variable or over-fitted. Using a Bayesian approach, we address these issues from a more quantitative perspective. The proposed method relies on only three key statistics: number of test records used, number of entries submitted, and the top score. A probability distribution of the maximum achievable score is then calculate. A metric for estimating future improvement over the top score is also derived; which can be used to assess significant contributions or risk of published results being tarnished due to public exposure of the test records and scores. We present our analysis  on several [PhysioNet][1] competitions, the [MIT-BIH][2] ECG beat detection task, and the  [Kaggle seizure prediction][3] competition.  The Bayesian estimator presented here can be a useful for:\n\n1. Designing public challenges and competitions. Using preliminary entry scores, (collected during an initial phase of the competition), the organizers can better ***estimate the required test set size or cost function*** for the competition in order to obtain reasonably small 95% confidence intervals around the final top score.\n\n2. External parties wishing to ***access over-fitting risk on the claimed performance of an algorithm on a public test set***, can use the 95% confidence interval from that data-set in order to gauge if the algorithm has over-trained on the public test records ( or the public test-set has be been overlay exposed, such as by using features from previous algorithms that reported high scores on the test sets). \n\n3. Students and  researchers, can use the estimated chance of improvement on a challenge in order to properly ***allocate resources to  underperforming competitions***,  so that their efforts are more likely to have a meaningful impact on the field.\n\n  [1]: https://www.physionet.org/challenge/\n  [2]: https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mitdb/\n  [3]: http://blog.kaggle.com/2016/10/14/getting-started-in-the-seizure-prediction-competition-impact-history-useful-resources/"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3cc6faa5-f5cb-ecdb-5c86-cfea57cae67b"},"source":"# Estimating maximum achievable performance\n\nThe maximum achievable score in a competition, \\( \\theta \\), is estimated via a Bayesian approach. It is assumed that the maximum score, \\( \\theta \\), $\\theta$, is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. A competitor's score can then be modeled as a random variable, \\( X \\), with distribution\n\n$$\nX \\sim U[0,\\theta]\\,. \\qquad (1)  \n$$\n\nThe maximum likelihood function for a set of \\( N\\)  independent samples, \\( \\bar{x}\\), from  \\( X\\) is then given by ([\\[Scharf1991][1],[DudaHart2012\\]][2]):\n\n$$\nl(\\theta,\\bar{x}) = \\frac{1}{\\theta^N}I_{[max(\\bar{x}),1)} \\qquad (2) \n$$\n\nwhere :\n\n$$\n    I_{[max(\\bar{x}),1)}= \n\\begin{cases}\n    1,& \\text{if } max(\\bar{x}) \\leq x\\leq 1\\\\\n   0,         & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n\nEstimation of the number of independent samples $\\hat{N}$ is a non-trivial task.  For Challenges that log the errors in each record and for each submission, a more accurate estimate of \\(\\hat{N}\\) may be achieved by looking at pair-wise independence of record errors across submissions, eliminating submissions whose distribution of errors across records are dependent with others via  a process similar to [Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization][3]. The log of errors across records would also allow challenge designers to measure which records are highly correlated and select a test set with less correlation in relation to the task at hand. Unfortunately this approach is not possible, or feasible, for several competitions. A more conservative estimate can be used by setting \\(\\hat{N}\\) to the minimum between number of test records used and number of entries submitted.  This choice  of \\(\\hat{N}\\) results on a confidence interval that will not decrease when number of entries exceed the test set size, yielding an estimator that is not [consistent][4], but which reflects our limited information from the test size. This second estimate for \\(\\hat{N}\\) can be used on open test data-sets where the number of entries is unknown, such as the [MIT-BIH data-set][5]. Only this second estimate of \\(\\hat{N}\\) is used on our analysis. \n\n\n  [1]: http://tocs.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/21055823.pdf\n  [2]: http://tocs.ulb.tu-darmstadt.de/21055823.pdf\n  [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram%E2%80%93Schmidt_process\n  [4]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consistent_estimator\n  [5]: https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mitdb)"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"ad2b109a-c04e-1f40-45d3-86c66420e6cc"},"outputs":[],"source":"import math\nimport numpy as np\nfrom numpy import arange, reciprocal, Inf,log, divide, loadtxt, inf, zeros,array,\\\n    NaN, exp\nfrom scipy.stats import entropy\nfrom matplotlib.pyplot import plot, show,  figure, legend, ylabel, xlabel,\\\n     fill_between, bar, scatter, ylim, text,title\nimport time\nfrom datetime import datetime, timedelta\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom numpy import Inf\n\ndef estimateTheta(N,best):\n    \"Use Baye's rule to estimate proportion of success from measurement\"\n    M=100 #Number of points to estimate in the likelihood function\n    theta=arange(best,1,(1-best)/float(M))\n    pdf=reciprocal(theta)**N\n    pdf=pdf/sum(pdf)\n    return theta,pdf\n    "},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"fa61e03f-cc96-fea9-8499-2c1bcc673c06"},"source":"## Estimating score likelihoods on PhysioNet competitions"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"ebf8ddce-dd4e-f113-abf7-afd36119a49d"},"outputs":[],"source":"# Analysis of performance on PhysioNet Datasets \n#M=number of test records, N= number of team submissions\nchal=[{\"best\":0.83,\"M\":15, \"N\":Inf,'title':'2010 Filling The Gap'}, \n      {\"best\":0.905,\"M\":2, \"N\":Inf,'title':'2004 ST Changes'},\n      {\"best\":0.5353,\"M\":4000, \"N\":21,'title':'2012 Mortality Prediction'},\n      {\"best\":0.8426,\"M\":500, \"N\":41,'title':'2015 False Alarm'},\n      {\"best\":0.932,\"M\":500, \"N\":49,'title':'2011 ECG Quality'},\n      {\"best\":0.9991,\"M\":22, \"N\":Inf,'title':'0 MIT-BIH Detection'}\n      ]\n#Estimate likelihoods using the method previously described\nfigure(figsize = (12,7))\nfor x in chal:\n    n=min(x['N'],x['M'])\n    theta,pdf=estimateTheta(n,x['best'])\n    plot(theta,pdf,label=x['title'])\nlegend() \nxlabel('Top Score')\nylabel('Likelihood')\ntitle('Estimated Top Score Likelihood')"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"44f89084-48dd-e939-19ff-4c658fe71cb5"},"source":"# Calculating chances of significant improvement \n\nFrom Equation ((2))  the maximum likelihood estimate for the top achievable score is, $max(\\bar{x})$,     the current best score.

For instance, although the known top scores on the 2010 and 2015 PhysioNet challenges from the figure above are close to 0.85, intuitively we expect the 2010 challenge to be easier to obtain further significant improvement due to the long tail nature of it's likelihood function.  Some useful statistics that we can use to relate the top score on a competition to the concentration of its likelihood function include:  variance/standard deviation, entropy, range, and distance from the mean. Note that the use of the distance of our maximum from the mean as a measure of dispersion is valid because of the unimodal monotic likelihood in our case.  We chose to use the distance between the maximum and estimated mean of the likelihood for this analysis, as its easier to interpret in terms of percent top scores.

One component of this overarching goal is to identify medically relevant functional tissue units (FTUs) within whole slide microscopy images of human tissues. Once these FTUs are detected, information on size, shape, variability in number and location within the tissue samples can be used to help build a spatially accurate and semantically explicit model of the human body.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Human Protein Atlas (HPA)\nThe [Human Protein Atlas](https://www.proteinatlas.org/) is a Swedish-based program initiated in 2003 with the aim to map all the human proteins in cells, tissues, and organs using an integration of various omics technologies, including antibody-based imaging, mass spectrometry-based proteomics, transcriptomics, and systems biology. All the data in the knowledge resource is open access to allow scientists both in academia and industry to freely access the data for exploration of the human proteome.

For the purposes of Human Reference Atlas ([Börner, 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-021-00788-6), [Godwin, 2021](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.09.467810v1), [Börner, 2021](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.12.30.474265v1)) construction and usage,we define an FTU as the smallest level of tissue organization (i.e., a cell population neighborhood) that performs the organ’s major physiological function.  One example of an FTU is the glomerulus found in the outer layer of kidney tissue known as the cortex, which in humans has an area of about 800 mm2 and average depth of about 9 mm ([Mounier-Vehier, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1523-1755.2002.00167.x)). Glomeruli consist of capillaries that facilitate filtration of waste products out of blood. Normal glomeruli typically range from 100-350 μm in diameter with a roughly spherical shape ([Kannan, 2019](https://www.kireports.org/article/S2468-0249(19)).

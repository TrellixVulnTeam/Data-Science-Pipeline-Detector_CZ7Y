But now, we've warped into this competition, and this competition, is a lot **different** than the one we covered EDA on. Instead of segmenting the GI Tracts, we'll identify and segment functional tissue units (FTUs) across five human organs. It's more like image segmentation, but it's on the tissues from not just one or two, but on the five human body parts. Nevertheless, let's do EDA here!\n\nBefore we proceed, check out our previous EDA competition regardless of GI Image Segmentation:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/code/dinowun/eda-simplified-uwm-gi-tract-segmentation-w-w-b","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Importing and Setup\nIn order to use EDA on this competition, we import the following modules first for data science and linear algebra, which is pandas as pd, numpy as np, and cv2 (aka OpenCV).

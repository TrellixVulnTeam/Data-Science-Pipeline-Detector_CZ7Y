Keras can use either of these backends:\n\n\n    Tensorflow – Google’s deeplearning library\n    Theano – may not be further developed\n    CNTK – Microsoft’s deeplearning library\n    MXNet – deeplearning library from Apache.org (currently under development)\n\nKeras uses these frameworks to deliver powerful computation while exposing a beautiful and intuitive (that kinda looks like scikit-learn) API.\n\nHere’s what Keras brings to the table:\n\n    The integration with the various backends is seamless\n    Run training on either CPU/GPU\n    Comes in two flavours: sequential or functional. Just to ways of thinking about building models. The resulting models are perfectly equivalent. We’re going to use the sequential one.\n    Fast prototyping – With all these good abstractions in place, you can just focus more on the problem and hyperparameter tunning.\n    \nLet’s now start using Keras to develop various types of models for Natural Language Processing. Here’s what we’ll be building:\n\n    (Dense) Deep Neural Network – The NN classic model – uses the BOW model\n    Convolutional Network – build a network using 1D Conv Layers – uses word vectors\n    Recurrent Networks – LSTM Network – Long Short-Term Memory – uses word vectors\n    Transfer learning for NLP – Learn how to load spaCy’s vectors or GloVe vectors – uses word

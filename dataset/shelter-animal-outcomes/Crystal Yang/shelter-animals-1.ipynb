But as enjoyable as it is to look at pictures of animals being happy in their furever home, what about their counterparts still in the animal shelter?  How many of them will find their happy ending, or get shipped to a different facility for a second chance, or even worse, be euthanized?  Kaggle has an old [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/shelter-animal-outcomes) that takes data from the [Austin Animal Center](http://www.austintexas.gov/department/aac) and Kagglers were tasked to predict the outcome for each animal.  \n\nThe training and test data sets are both taken from a date range between 10/01/2013 to 2/21/2016.  \nMost of the features are self explanatory, but the key column is the OutcomeType, which signals if the animal has been adopted, died, euthanized, returned to owner, or transferred to another shelter.  The features include names, animal type, gener, age, breed, and color.  \n\n\nFirst, lets import all the libraries and the test and training datasets."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0a3225394b57f1567c1d5c54cf149898e62603e3"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 1.1 - Importing Libraries"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"869367afbe6f3ddb625ef82e0fb4493190965620"},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"7e38721b706ae9760d737af15c0bdc0d5ecd2b62"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 1.2 - Load the Training Set"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"2542f6521d2814a0b83ae4292ebc169c328d0564"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv', parse_dates=['DateTime'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"scrolled":true,"trusted":true,"_uuid":"ac87b7ae47faf0cf9df7192d679c1a9b02630196"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"437d21f729eb253170768bad4745c5ad02cd0275"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"0047d3d3e0182815f72548a26780af00fd30b2f2"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"2e97f691e1ae2045f2737b7a7f7175e9af030c9c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 1.3 - Load the Test Set"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"65917169376249e18907c0d04baae72559606802"},"cell_type":"code","source":"test_df = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv', parse_dates=['DateTime'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"1c3763258712278e9d493e6499a2a673e1f34fa0"},"cell_type":"code","source":"test_df.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"1582a7e284e6aacf1da672a442024aefab6db333"},"cell_type":"code","source":"test_df.describe(include = 'all')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"70eb821819124843a8e2a18c03ba109378c2067e"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First, I'd like to rename the columns to make them shorter, and delete the 'AnimalID' column in the training set since that won't tell us anything useful."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"6e77b3a8d566833857cb18f3220890e891f91f7b"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df.rename(columns = {'OutcomeType': 'Outcome1', 'OutcomeSubtype': 'Outcome2', 'AnimalType': 'Animal', 'SexuponOutcome': 'Sex', 'AgeuponOutcome': 'Age'}, inplace=True)\ntest_df.rename(columns = {'AnimalType': 'Animal', 'SexuponOutcome': 'Sex', 'AgeuponOutcome': 'Age'}, inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"759ad10616b7f9a6b2b65f4ae7283537f2e72ad0"},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df.drop('AnimalID', axis = 1, inplace = True)\ntest_ID = test_df['ID']\ntest_df.drop('ID', axis = 1, inplace = True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"9ba656c5577e8cab9410c4513ee456e72dd77cff"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2 - Initial Exploration\nI've discovered fast.ai with Jeremy Howard and his course is really turning my world upside down.

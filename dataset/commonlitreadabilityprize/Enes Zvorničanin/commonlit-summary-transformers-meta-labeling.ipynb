The process of NLP text preprocessing includes removing stop words, punctuation, and numbers in the text. The primary goal of NLP text preprocessing is to remove content that does not carry any semantic meaning. This will help reduce the time needed for processing and make the rest of the process more accurate.\n<br><br>\n<b>Stopword removal</b> removes a list of common words (e.g., \"a\", \"an\", \"the\") that are not useful for building any meaningful relationships between different input sentences or phrases.\n<b>Lemmatizing</b> is the process of reducing words to their roots or base forms, which are more easily processed by computers. For example, the words \"writing\", \"written\" and \"writes\" might all be assigned the lexeme \"write.\"\nIn order to analyze textuall content, we can observe most common <b>unigrams</b> (single word), <b>bigrams</b> (group of two words), <b>trigrams</b> (group of two words) etc.\n<br><br>\nText <b>part-of-speech tagging</b> is the process by which a machine assigns parts of speech to words according to linguistic rules and patterns. The most common POS tags are Noun, Verb, Adjective, Adverb, Preposition, Conjunction, Interjection.\n<br><br>\nEDA, stopword removal, lemmatizing and part-of-speech tagging are presented here <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/commonlit-readability-prize-eda-baseline\">https://www.kaggle.com/ruchi798/commonlit-readability-prize-eda-baseline</a>\n</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div class=\"heading\">\n   <h1><span style=\"color: white\">Other useful notebooks</span></h1>\n</div>\n<div class='content'>\n    \nNot directly related to this competition but interesting, step by step implementation of <b>NGram</b> approach, where the idea is to get the next word given the sequence of words <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/alincijov/nlp-starter-logsoftmax-nlloss-cross-entropy\">https://www.kaggle.com/alincijov/nlp-starter-logsoftmax-nlloss-cross-entropy</a>\n<br><br>\n<b>PyTorch data samplers</b> and how to contol batches <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/shahules/guide-pytorch-data-samplers-sequence-bucketing\">https://www.kaggle.com/shahules/guide-pytorch-data-samplers-sequence-bucketing</a>\n<br><br>\nComprehensive notebook with <b>data cleaning</b> techniques <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/mpwolke/dataprep-clean-literature\">https://www.kaggle.com/mpwolke/dataprep-clean-literature</a>\n</div>","metadata":{}}]}

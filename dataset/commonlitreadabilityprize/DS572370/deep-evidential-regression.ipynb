However, each has its issues. Tools like Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level are based on weak proxies of text decoding (i.e., characters or syllables per word) and syntactic complexity (i.e., number or words per sentence). As a result, they lack construct and theoretical validity. At the same time, commercially available formulas, such as Lexile, can be cost-prohibitive, lack suitable validation studies, and suffer from transparency issues when the formula's features aren't publicly available.\n\nCommonLit, Inc., is a nonprofit education technology organization serving over 20 million teachers and students with free digital reading and writing lessons for grades 3-12. Together with Georgia State University, an R1 public research university in Atlanta, they are challenging Kagglers to improve readability rating methods.\n\nIn this competition, youâ€™ll build algorithms to rate the complexity of reading passages for grade 3-12 classroom use. To accomplish this, you'll pair your machine learning skills with a dataset that includes readers from a wide variety of age groups and a large collection of texts taken from various domains. Winning models will be sure to incorporate text cohesion and semantics.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport spacy as sp\nimport tensorflow as tf\n\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-27T05:40:12.463093Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-27T05:40:12.463513Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-27T05:40:19.270299Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-27T05:40:12.463478Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-27T05:40:19.269323Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## [Deep Evidential Regression](https://www.mit.edu/~amini/pubs/pdf/deep-evidential-regression.pdf)\nDeterministic neural networks (NNs) are increasingly being deployed in safety critical domains, where calibrated, robust, and efficient measures of uncertainty are crucial.

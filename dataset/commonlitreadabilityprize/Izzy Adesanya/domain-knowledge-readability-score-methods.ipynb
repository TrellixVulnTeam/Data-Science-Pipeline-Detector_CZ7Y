The Flesch Reading Ease formula**\n\nThe Flesch Reading Ease Formula is a simple approach to assess the grade-level of the reader. It‚Äôs also one of the few accurate measures around that we can rely on without too much scrutiny. This formula is best used on school text. It has since become a standard readability formula used by many US Government Agencies, including the US Department of Defense. However, primarily, we use the formula to assess the difficulty of a reading passage written in English.\n\n**The Flesch Reading Ease Readability Formula**\n\nThe specific mathematical formula is:\n\nRE = 206.835 ‚Äì (1.015 x ASL) ‚Äì (84.6 x ASW)\n\nRE = Readability Ease\n\nASL = Average Sentence Length (i.e., the number of words divided by the number of sentences)\n\nASW = Average number of syllables per word (i.e., the number of syllables divided by the number of words)\n\nThe output, i.e., RE is a number ranging from 0 to 100. The higher the number, the easier the text is to read.\n\n**‚Ä¢ Scores between 90.0 and 100.0 are considered easily understandable by an average 5th grader.**\n\n**‚Ä¢ Scores between 60.0 and 70.0 are considered easily understood by 8th and 9th graders.**\n\n**‚Ä¢ Scores between 0.0 and 30.0 are considered easily understood by college graduates.**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**2. The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level**\n\nThis formula is known by different names, like Flesch-Kincaid Index, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Score, Flesch-Kincaid Scale, Flesch-Kincaid Score, Flesch-Kincaid Readability Score, Flesch-Kincaid Readability Statistics, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Index, Flesch-Kincaid Readability Index, Flesch-Kincaid readability equation, and so on.\n\n**The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Readability Formula**\n\nStep 1: Calculate the average number of words used per sentence.\n\nStep 2: Calculate the average number of syllables per word.\n\nStep 3: Multiply the average number of words by 0.39 and add it to the average number of syllables per word multiplied by 11.8.\n\nStep 4: Subtract 15.59 from the result.\n\nThe specific mathematical formula is:\n\nFKRA = (0.39 x ASL) + (11.8 x ASW) - 15.59\n\nWhere,\n\nFKRA = Flesch-Kincaid Reading Age\n\nASL = Average Sentence Length (i.e., the number of words divided by the number of sentences)\n\nASW = Average number of Syllable per Word (i.e., the number of syllables divided by the number of words)\n\nAnalyzing the results is a simple exercise. For instance, a **score of 5.0 indicates a grade-school level**; i.e., a **score of 9.3 means that a ninth grader would be able to read the document**. This score makes it easier for teachers, parents, librarians, and others to judge the readability level of various books and texts for the students.\n\nTheoretically, the lowest grade level score could be -3.4, but since there are no real passages that have every sentence consisting of a one-syllable word, it is a highly improbable result in practice.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**3. The Fog Scale**\n\nThe Gunning Fog Index Readability Formula, or simply called FOG Index, is attributed to American textbook publisher, Robert Gunning, who was a graduate from Ohio State University. Gunning observed that most high school graduates were unable to read. Much of this reading problem was a writing problem. His opinion was that newspapers and business documents were full of ‚Äúfog‚Äù and unnecessary complexity.\n\n**The Gunning‚Äôs Fog Index (or FOG) Readability Formula**\n\nStep 1: Take a sample passage of at least 100-words and count the number of exact words and sentences.\n\nStep 2: Divide the total number of words in the sample by the number of sentences to arrive at the Average Sentence Length (ASL).\n\nStep 3: Count the number of words of three or more syllables that are NOT (i) proper nouns, (ii) combinations of easy words or hyphenated words, or (iii) two-syllable verbs made into three with -es and -ed endings.\n\nStep 4: Divide this number by the number or words in the sample passage. For example, 25 long words divided by 100 words gives you 25 Percent Hard Words (PHW).\n\nStep 5: Add the ASL from Step 2 and the PHW from Step 4.\n\nStep 6: Multiply the result by 0.4.\n\nThe mathematical formula is:\n\nGrade Level = 0.4 (ASL + PHW)\n\nwhere,\n\nASL = Average Sentence Length (i.e., number of words divided by the number of sentences)\n\nPHW = Percentage of Hard Words\n\nThe underlying message of The Gunning Fog Index formula is that short sentences written in Plain English achieve a better score than long sentences written in complicated language.\n\nThe **ideal score for readability with the Fog index is 7 or 8. Anything above 12 is too hard for most people to read**. For instance, The Bible, Shakespeare and Mark Twain have Fog Indexes of around 6. The leading magazines, like Time, Newsweek, and the Wall Street Journal average around 11.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**4. The SMOG Index**\n\nG Harry McLaughlin created the SMOG Readability Formula in 1969 through an article, SMOG Grading ‚Äì A New Readability Formula in the Journal of Reading. SMOG Readability Formula estimates the years of education a person needs to understand a piece of writing. McLaughlin created this formula as an improvement over other readability formulas. You may come across SMOG as an acronym for Simple Measure of Gobbledygook, but it‚Äôs widely believed the title is a nod to Robert Gunning‚Äôs FOG Index.\n\n**The SMOG Readability Formula**\n\nStep 1: Take the entire text to be assessed.\n\nStep 2: Count 10 sentences in a row near the beginning, 10 in the middle, and 10 in the end for a total of 30 sentences.\n\nStep 3: Count every word with three or more syllables in each group of sentences, even if the same word appears more than once.\n\nStep 4: Calculate the square root of the number arrived at in Step 3 and round it off to nearest 10.\n\nStep 4: Add 3 to the figure arrived at in Step 4 to know the SMOG Grade, i.e., the reading grade that a person must have reached if he is to understand fully the text assessed.\n\nSMOG grade = 3 + Square Root of Polysyllable Count\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**5. The Coleman-Liau Index**\n\nThe Coleman‚ÄìLiau Readability Formula (also known as The Coleman‚ÄìLiau Index) is a readability assessment test designed by linguists Meri Coleman and T. L. Liau to approximate the usability of a text. Coleman said he created the formula as one of the many ways to help the U.S. Office of Education calibrate the readability of all textbooks for the public school system. Like other popular readability formulas, the Coleman‚ÄìLiau Index approximates a U.S. grade level to understand the text.\n\nYou calculate the Coleman‚ÄìLiau Index with the following formula:\n\n![](https://readabilityformulas.com/graphics/ccriformula.jpg)\n\nL is the average number of letters per 100 words. S is the average number of sentences per 100 words.\n\nAs an example, let's use this abstract from a public domain book:\n\nThe best things in an artist‚Äôs work are so much a matter of intuition, that there is much to be said for the point of view that would altogether discourage intellectual inquiry into artistic phenomena on the part of the artist. Intuitions are shy things and apt to disappear if looked into too closely. And there is undoubtedly a danger that too much knowledge and training may supplant the natural intuitive feeling of a student, leaving only a cold knowledge of the means of expression in its place. For the artist, if he has the right stuff in him ...\n\n\nThe abstract contains 4 sentences, 100 words, and 448 letters or digits; L is 448 and S is 4.\n\nFormula: CLI = 0.0588 x 448(L) - 0.296 x 4.0(S) - 15.8 = 10.6\n\n**Therefore, this formula grades this abstract of text at a grade level of 10.6, or roughly appropriate for a 10-11th grade high school student.**\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**6. Automated Readability Index**\n\nThe Automated Readability Index (ARI) is a readability test designed to assess the understandability of a text. Like other popular readability formulas, the ARI formula outputs a number which approximates the grade level needed to comprehend the text. For example, if the ARI outputs the number 10, this equates to a high school student, ages 15-16 years old; a number 3 means students in 3rd grade (ages 8-9 yrs. old) should be able to comprehend the text.\n\nHere is the formula to calculate the Automated Readability Index:\n\n![](https://readabilityformulas.com/graphics/ariformula.jpg)\n\nCharacters are the number of letters and numbers.\n\nThe Automated Readability Index outputs a number that approximates the age needed to understand the text. As a rough guide, US grade level 1 corresponds to ages 6 to 8. Reading level grade 8 corresponds to the typical reading level of a 14 year-old US child. Grade 12, the highest US secondary school grade before college, corresponds to the reading level of a 17 year old.\n\n\nHere is a breakdown of grade levels in the U.S.:\n\n5-6 yrs. old ‚Äî Kindergarten\n\n6-7 yrs. old ‚Äî First Grade\n\n7-8 yrs. old ‚Äî Second Grade\n\n8-9 yrs. old ‚Äî Third Grade\n\n9-10 yrs. old ‚Äî Fourth Grade\n\n10-11 yrs. old ‚Äî Fifth Grade\n\n11-12 yrs. old ‚Äî Sixth Grade\n\n12-13 yrs. old ‚Äî Seventh Grade\n\n13-14 yrs. old ‚Äî Eighth Grade\n\n14-15 yrs. old ‚Äî Ninth Grade\n\n15-16 yrs. old ‚Äî Tenth Grade\n\n16-17 yrs. old ‚Äî Eleventh grade\n\n17-18 yrs. old ‚Äî Twelfth grade\n\n18-22 yrs. old - College","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1 style=\"border:2px solid Purple;text-align:center\">Understanding the Problem (Putting it all togather) üìö</h1>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"With this competition, our task to create a mapping function that takes an excerpt passage as input and throws out the readability score denoting the complexity score of the passage.\n\nWhich as the competition says will be used in -> \"*If successful, you'll aid administrators, teachers, and students.

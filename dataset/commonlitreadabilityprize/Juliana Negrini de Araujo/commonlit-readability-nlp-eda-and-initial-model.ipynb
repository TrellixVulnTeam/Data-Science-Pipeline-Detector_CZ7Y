Overview\n\nIn this challenge we are given classroom text data that are used as reading passages for grade 3-12. The goal is to use ML as a regression model to define the readability score of each text passage:\n\n> \"*In this competition, youâ€™ll build algorithms to rate the complexity of reading passages for grade 3-12 classroom use. To accomplish this, you'll pair your machine learning skills with a dataset that includes readers from a wide variety of age groups and a large collection of texts taken from various domains. Winning models will be sure to incorporate text cohesion and semantics.<br>\n>  If successful, you'll aid administrators, teachers, and students. Literacy curriculum developers and teachers who choose passages will be able to quickly and accurately evaluate works for their classrooms. Plus, these formulas will become more accessible for all. Perhaps most importantly, students will benefit from feedback on the complexity and readability of their work, making it far easier to improve essential reading skills.*\"\n\n## 1.1 Acknowledgements\n\nIn the Kaggle competition page, CommonLit extends a special thanks to Professor Scott Crossley's research team at the Georgia State University Departments of Applied Linguistics and Learning Sciences for their partnership on this project.In addition, Schmidt Futures is also highlighted for their advice and support for making this challenge possible.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.

obtain the optimal number of SVD parameters, a simple code was created to iterate over the number of components. The optimal value is the one that achieves the best RMSE on the test set, while displaying a similar result in the K-Fold validation set RMSE. Similar RMSE on test and validation sets gives assurance that the model is not prone to overfit and the hyperparameters are properly defined.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":">LGBM definition","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"LGBMModel = lgbm.LGBMRegressor(objective='regression',\n                               metric = 'rmse',\n                               verbose=-1, \n                               learning_rate=0.019, \n                               max_depth=360, \n                               num_leaves=680, \n                               early_stopping_round = 50, \n                               n_estimators = 10000,\n                               reg_alpha = 0.021314,\n                               reg_lambda = 0.00856,\n                                force_col_wise=True)","metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-27T21:29:24.121694Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-27T21:29:24.122142Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-27T21:29:24.142712Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-27T21:29:24.122112Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-27T21:29:24.1412Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":" >code to define the number of SVD components","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"test = []\ntrain = []\ni_list = list(range(5,100,5))\nfor i in i_list:# Apply SVD and lgbm\n    svd = decomposition.TruncatedSVD(n_components=i)\n    xtrain_svd = svd.fit_transform(x_train_tfidf)\n    xtest_svd = svd.transform(x_test_tfidf)\n    LGBMModel.fit(xtrain_svd, y_train, eval_metric='rmse', eval_set=[(xtest_svd, y_test)],verbose=0)    \n    predictions_train = LGBMModel.predict(xtrain_svd)\n    predictions_test = LGBMModel.predict(xtest_svd)\n    train_rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_train, predictions_train))\n    test_rmse = np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_test, predictions_test))\n    \n    train.append(train_rmse)\n    test.append(test_rmse)","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-27T21:29:24.148197Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-27T21:29:24.148965Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-27T21:30:21.833777Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-27T21:29:24.148913Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-27T21:30:21.832883Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The graph below shows the relationship between the RMSE for Validation and Test sets according to the number of SVD components.

JAX uses the incredible XLA compiler which makes the code efficient to run on TPUs.

Once the compilation is done, a TPU-v3 can finish an entire epoch of training and evaluating on this dataset in less than 5 seconds (tested on Colab, Kaggle and TPU-VM), this is amazing!\n\nBest part of all, Kaggle gives you 30 free hours of TPUv3-8 usage every week!

During training the weight parameters should be updated as follows:\n\n1. Define a loss function `loss_function` that first runs a forward pass of the model given data input. Remember that Flax models are immutable, and we explicitly pass it the state (in this case the model parameters and the RNG). `loss_function` returns a scalar loss (using the previously defined `state.loss_function`) between the model output and input targets.\n2. Differentiate this loss function using [`jax.value_and_grad`](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/autodiff_cookbook.html#evaluate-a-function-and-its-gradient-using-value-and-grad). This is a JAX transformation called [automatic differentiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation), which computes the gradient of `loss_function` given the input to the function (i.e., the parameters of the model), and returns the value and the gradient in a pair `(loss, gradients)`.\n3. Compute the mean gradient over all devices using the collective operation [lax.pmean](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_autosummary/jax.lax.pmean.html). As we will see below, each device runs `train_step` on a different batch of data, but by taking the mean here we ensure the model parameters are the same on all devices.\n4.

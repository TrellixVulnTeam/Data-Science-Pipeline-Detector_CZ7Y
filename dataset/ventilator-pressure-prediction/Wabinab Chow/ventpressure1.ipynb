Second thing is, the reason some are large and some are small is because when the patient breathe, the machine not necessarily only open up a small hole (since `u_in` is percentage), it could open up fully and let the patient breath hard hard. Hence, this is why most are small (very shallow breath) while some are large (deep breath). If you notice your own breath, usually we breath very shallow (like not even filling half of our lungs, unconscious breathing mostly); while other times we breath very deep \"down to the bottom\" (when we breath consciously). Unless you practice meditation or other breathing exercises, normal human don't breath that deep most of the time. \n\nSo one previously mention the difference in lung isn't quite correct.

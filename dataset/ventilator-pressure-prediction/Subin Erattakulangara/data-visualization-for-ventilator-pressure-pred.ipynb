So there is a gap for a lung ventilation simulator based on deep learning which can adapt to each type of patient. This would reduce the cost of ventilators a lot\n\n**Parameters**\n* U_in - The amount of air allowed into the lungs during inhalation process ( or expansion )\n* U_out - The amount of air pumped out of lungs during exhalation ( or contraction )\n* Pressure - The mesure of pressure when U_In and U_out is happening\n* C - Complience of the lungs or how easily can we strech the lungs. 3 values given ( 10, 20, 50)\n* R - Resistance of lungs. How easy can air go in and out of lungs. 3 values (5, 20, 50)\n\n**Training Data**\n* 7 Columns including ID\n* 2 data types int64 & float 64","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-17T01:17:05.840345Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-17T01:17:05.840701Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-17T01:17:05.865382Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-17T01:17:05.840615Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-17T01:17:05.864713Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Read the train Data \n\n> The most import part of the data is the subjects.

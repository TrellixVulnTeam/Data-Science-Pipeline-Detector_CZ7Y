Then, compare them and you will get various insights.\n- For example, keep R constant and look at the results of varying C .\n- A larger C means that the lungs are more easily stretched. So, in the plot with C of 50, we can see that the air can easily escape into the lungs, so the pressure is not likely to be high (note that the scale of the axis is different for each plot).\n- Conversely, look at the results of keeping C constant and varying R.A large R means that the airway resistance is large and air cannot flow. So, in the plot with R of 50, we can see that the pressure is higher.\n- Do you have some idea of what R and C are?\n- I hope this note helps you to understand.\n","metadata":{}}]}

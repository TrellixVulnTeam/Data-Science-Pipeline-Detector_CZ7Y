They use a ventilator to pump oxygen into a sedated patient's lungs via a tube in the windpipe. But mechanical ventilation is a clinician-intensive procedure, a limitation that was prominently on display during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, developing new methods for controlling mechanical ventilators is prohibitively expensive, even before reaching clinical trials. High-quality simulators could reduce this barrier.\n\n# **<span style=\"color:#F7B2B0;\">Goal</span>**\n \nThe goal is to simulate a ventilator connected to a sedated patient's lung by taking lung attributes compliance and resistance into account.\n\n# **<span style=\"color:#F7B2B0;\">Data</span>**\n\nEach time series represents an approximately 3-second breath. The files are organized such that each row is a time step in a breath and gives the two control signals, the resulting airway pressure, and relevant attributes of the lung, described below.\n\n**Files**\n> - ``` train.csv``` - the training set\n> - ```test.csv``` - the test set\n> - ```sample_submission.csv``` - a sample submission file in the correct format\n\n**Columns**\n> - ```id``` - globally-unique time step identifier across an entire file\n> - ```breath_id``` - globally-unique time step for breaths\n> - ```R``` - lung attribute indicating how restricted the airway is (in cmH2O/L/S). Physically, this is the change in pressure per change in flow (air volume per time). Intuitively, one can imagine blowing up a balloon through a straw. We can change R by changing the diameter of the straw, with higher R being harder to blow.\n> - ```C``` - lung attribute indicating how compliant the lung is (in mL/cmH2O). Physically, this is the change in volume per change in pressure. Intuitively, one can imagine the same balloon example. We can change C by changing the thickness of the balloon’s latex, with higher C having thinner latex and easier to blow.\n> - ```time_step``` - the actual time stamp.\n> - ```u_in``` - the control input for the inspiratory solenoid valve. Ranges from 0 to 100.\n> - ```u_out``` - the control input for the exploratory solenoid valve. Either 0 or 1.\n> - ```pressure``` - the airway pressure measured in the respiratory circuit, measured in cmH2O\n\n# **<span style=\"color:#F7B2B0;\">Evaluation Metric</span>**\n\nThe competition will be scored as the mean absolute error between the predicted and actual pressures during the inspiratory phase of each breath. The expiratory phase is not scored. The score is given by:\n\n                                        |X-Y|\n\nwhere  is the vector of predicted pressure and  is the vector of actual pressures across all breaths in the test set.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img src=\"https://camo.githubusercontent.com/dd842f7b0be57140e68b2ab9cb007992acd131c48284eaf6b1aca758bfea358b/68747470733a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f52557469567a482e706e67\">\n\n> I will be integrating W&B for visualizations and logging artifacts!\n> \n> [Google Brain - Ventilator Pressure Prediction Project on W&B Dashboard](https://wandb.ai/usharengaraju/GoogleBrainVentilatorPressurePrediction)\n> \n> - To get the API key, create an account in the [website](https://wandb.ai/site) .\n> - Use secrets to use API Keys more securely \n\n<span style=\"color: #000508; font-family: Segoe UI; font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: 300;\"> Weights & Biases (W&B) is a set of machine learning tools that helps you build better models faster. <strong>Kaggle competitions require fast-paced model development and evaluation</strong>.

The number of Steps is a hyperparameter option when training the model. Increasing the number of steps will increase the learning capacity of the model, but will also increase training time, memory usage and the chance of overfitting.Each Step gets its own vote in the final classification and these votes are equally weighted. This mimics an ensemble classification.\n\n# **<span style=\"color:#F7B2B0;\">Feature Transformer:</span>**\n\nThe Feature Transformer is a network which has an architecture of its own.It has multiple layers, some of which are shared across every Step while others are unique to each Step. Each layer contains a fully connected layer, batch normalisation and a Gated Linear Unit activiation.\n\nSharing some layers between decision Steps leads to “parameter-efficient and robust learning with high capacity” and that normalization with root 0.5 “helps to stabilize learning by ensuring that the variance throughout does not change dramatically”. The output of the feature transformer uses a ReLU activation function.\n\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1iuVE-7hkmh2ZMFfY3FdrZ1UbptidK-mI)\n\n# **<span style=\"color:#F7B2B0;\">Feature Selection :</span>**\n\nOnce features have been transformed, they are passed to the Attentive Transformer and the Mask for feature selection.The Attentive Transformer is comprised of a fully connected layer, batch normalisation and Sparsemax normalisation. It also includes prior scales, meaning it knows how much each feature has been used by the previous steps. This is used to derive the Mask using the processed features from the previous Feature Transformer.\n\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=12PNJHZqt7bso16m0H8NZ0wrDq9uLdX0U)\n\nThe Mask ensures the model focuses on the most important features and is also used to derive explainability. It essentially covers up features, meaning the model is only able to use those that have been considered important by the Attentive Transformer.We can also understand feature importance by looking at how much a feature has been masked for all decisions and and an individual prediction.\nTabNet employs soft feature selection with controllable sparsity in end-to-end learning\nThis means one model jointly performs feature selection and output mapping, which leads to better performance.TabNet uses instance-wise feature selection, which means features are selected for each input and each prediction can use different features.\nThis feature selection is essential as it allows decision boundaries to be generalised to a linear combination of features, where coefficients determine the proportion of each feature, which in the end leads to the model’s interpretability","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"X      = df_train[common_features]\ny      = df_train[\"pressure\"]\nX_test = df_test[common_features]","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-29T15:59:06.493939Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-29T15:59:06.494659Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-29T15:59:06.501587Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-29T15:59:06.49462Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-29T15:59:06.50078Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"X      = X.to_numpy()\ny      = y.to_numpy().reshape(-1, 1)\nX_test = X_test.to_numpy()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-29T15:59:06.502596Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-29T15:59:06.502952Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-29T15:59:06.511953Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-29T15:59:06.50292Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-29T15:59:06.511253Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"regressor = TabNetRegressor(verbose=0,seed=42)\nregressor.fit(X_train=X, y_train=y,max_epochs=5,eval_metric=['mae'])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-29T15:59:06.514883Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-29T15:59:06.515311Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-29T15:59:12.0199Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-29T15:59:06.51527Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-29T15:59:12.019234Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"output = regressor.predict(X_test)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-29T15:59:12.021167Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-29T15:59:12.021741Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-29T15:59:12.256044Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-29T15:59:12.021709Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-29T15:59:12.255368Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **<span style=\"color:#F7B2B0;\">References</span>**\n\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.07442.pdf\n\nhttps://towardsdatascience.com/tabnet-e1b979907694\n\n@karnikakapoor Header styles \n\n@debarshichanda Wandb Content","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Work in progress 🚧","metadata":{}}]}

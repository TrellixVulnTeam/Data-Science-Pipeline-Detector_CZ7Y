The mean and standard deviation (across the folds) of the importance of each feature is then reported.\n\nWhile other feature importance methods usually calculate how much a feature is used by the model, LOFO estimates how much a feature can make a difference by itself given that we have the other features. Here are some advantages of LOFO:\n* It generalises well to unseen test sets since it uses a validation scheme.\n* It is model agnostic.\n* It gives negative importance to features that hurt performance upon inclusion.\n* It can group the features. Especially useful for high dimensional features like TFIDF or OHE features. It is also good practice to group very correlated features to avoid misleading results.\n* It can automatically group highly correlated features to avoid underestimating their importance.\n\nhttps://github.com/aerdem4/lofo-importance","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install lofo-importance","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-13T06:56:11.903877Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-13T06:56:11.905004Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-13T06:56:22.236105Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-13T06:56:11.904861Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-13T06:56:22.23505Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nimport os, sys\nimport torch\n\nPATH = \"../input/ventilator-pressure-prediction\"\n\n\ndf = pd.read_csv(f\"{PATH}/train.csv\")\nprint(df.shape)\ndf.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-13T06:56:22.23807Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-13T06:56:22.238329Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-13T06:56:32.811561Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-13T06:56:22.238291Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-13T06:56:32.810666Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def engineer_features(df):\n    df[\"u_in_sum\"] = df.groupby(\"breath_id\")[\"u_in\"].transform(\"sum\")\n    df[\"u_in_cumsum\"] = df.groupby(\"breath_id\")[\"u_in\"].cumsum()\n    df[\"u_in_std\"] = df.groupby(\"breath_id\")[\"u_in\"].transform(\"std\")\n    df[\"u_in_min\"] = df.groupby(\"breath_id\")[\"u_in\"].transform(\"min\")\n    df[\"u_in_max\"] = df.groupby(\"breath_id\")[\"u_in\"].transform(\"max\")\n    df[\"u_in_cumsum_reverse\"] = df[\"u_in_sum\"] -

We have to keep in mind each breath has a different PIP (and potentially other parameters).\n\nWe only consider R = 20, C = 10.\n\nDuring our analysis we found that the following features might be useful:\n* Boolean variable denoting whether $u_{in}$ reaches zero anywhere before the inhale phase. This is an imperfect proxy for pressure overshooting PIP. Notice sometimes $u_{in} = 0$ at the first timestep, this should be discarded\n* Integral of $u_{in}$ up to the time of the first zero $u_{in}$. Should be a proxy for PIP, as the first zero in $u_{in}$ represent roughly the time when the pressure crosses PIP and the integral of $u_{in}$ roughly represents the amount of air injected\n* $u_{in}^{0.69}$ and its shifts, lags, cumulative sum, ...\n\nVersion 4: Checked the idea we might estimate PIP by a simple algebraic equation.

This feature has been created by kmeans clustering and maybe you can also use this in other compeitions too ! Simple words i have clustered the input features into 3 categories so why 3 lets explain the distribution of the ground targets can be divided into 3 types in the first type the pressure increases in a linear fashion peaks and goes down in the next type it goes up platues and then goes down and in the 3rd one it goes up then down and then up again and peaks no need to worry plots are available :3. So i first clustered that i mean the target values and as the input features is related to the target values i clustered that too and found they are almost related . So thats what this notebook covers training script is also available https://www.kaggle.com/swaralipibose/gb-vpp-pulp-fiction-abb651 and also a dataset https://www.kaggle.com/swaralipibose/features and also a ensemble with 0.1357 score https://www.kaggle.com/swaralipibose/median-ensemble-of-published-notebooks","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Import\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#weights=np.random.randn(1,80)\ntargets=np.load('../input/spectogram-dataset/y.npy')","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"targets.shape","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"average=np.mean(targets,axis=0)\naverage.shape","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.plot(range(80),average)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"MAE=np.mean(np.abs(average[np.newaxis,...]-targets))\nMAE","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"targets.shape","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.plot(range(80),targets[1])\nplt.plot(range(80),targets[2])\nplt.plot(range(80),targets[3])","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Load input features","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"X=np.load('../input/trianing-vent-cnn-spec/traind.npy').reshape(-1,80*4)\nxtest=np.load('../input/trianing-vent-cnn-spec/testd.npy').reshape(-1,80*4)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"X.shape","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# K-means","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport statsmodels.api as sm\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set()\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\nkmeans = KMeans(3)\nkmeans.fit(X)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"identified_clusters = kmeans.predict(X)\nidentified_clusters[0:6]","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"np.save('clusters.npy',identified_clusters)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"identified_clusters = kmeans.predict(xtest)\nidentified_clusters[0:6]","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"np.save('clusters_test.npy',identified_clusters)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pickle\npickle.dump(kmeans,open('kmeans.pkl','wb'))","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}

For a lot of common problems in computer vision, the go-to architecture is `resnet34`. Most of the modern CNN architectures like ResNext, DenseNet are different variants to original `resnet` architecture.\n\nUnderstanding the functioning of the `resnet` model helps us while building custom architectures for problems like image classification, segmentation, and object detection. For example, when using the `resnet` model as the backbone for image segmentation using U-net architecture, we create skip connections between different blocks of encoder and decoder. So it becomes a lot easier to understand and build these architectures later on since we already know how resnet is built. Understanding these architecture helps in guessing the output shapes of each `resnet` block which is in turn added to different decoder blocks.\n\nResNets were introduced in the [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) paper by Kaiming He et al.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"###  imports\nLet's grab some imports","metadata":{"heading_collapsed":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nfrom torchvision import models\nimport pdb","metadata":{"hidden":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-07T11:14:20.610078Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-07T11:14:20.610651Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-07T11:14:21.729759Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-07T11:14:20.610615Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-07T11:14:21.728917Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Resnet architecture from torchvision \nFirst things first , let's understand what are we trying to build here. \nPull out resnet34 architecture from Pytorch models.","metadata":{"heading_collapsed":true}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"models.resnet34()","metadata":{"hidden":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-07T11:14:21.731295Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-07T11:14:21.731577Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-07T11:14:22.174025Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-07T11:14:21.731552Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-07T11:14:22.172992Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We are going to build this from scratch in next sections.","metadata":{"hidden":true}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='implement' aria-hidden='true'></a>\n## Building Resnet","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Input\n\nGrab random input to understand how feature maps are generated in convolution layer.\n\nPytorch nn.Conv2d layer expects inputs of (batch_size, channels, height, width).\n\nWe are considering batch size of 2, 3 RGB color channels, height and width of 224 each.

Residual blocks enable building neural networks with 1000's of layers deep. Skip connections without adding much of overload on the network preserves information from initial layers till the last. \n\nWe have learned how to build resnet34 architecture from scratch. We can extend it to deeper models like resnet50, 101, and 152 using BottleNeck Block as in PyTorch.

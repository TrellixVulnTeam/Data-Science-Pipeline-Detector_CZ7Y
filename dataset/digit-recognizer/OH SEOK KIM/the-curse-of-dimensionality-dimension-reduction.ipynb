The common theme of these problems is that when the dimensionality increases, the volume of the space increases so fast that the available data become sparse. In order to obtain a reliable result, the amount of data needed often grows exponentially with the dimensionality. Also, organizing and searching data often relies on detecting areas where objects form groups with similar properties; in high dimensional data, however, all objects appear to be sparse and dissimilar in many ways, which prevents common data organization strategies from being efficient.\n\nRef: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Dimension reduction** is to create a new dimension data set by reducing the dimension of a multidimensional data set composed of very many features. In general, as the dimension increases, the distance between data points becomes exponentially farther, and it has a sparse structure. In the case of a data set consisting of hundreds or more features, the prediction reliability is lower than that of a model trained on relatively few dimensions. Also, if there are many features, the correlation between individual features is likely to be high. In a linear model such as linear regression, when the correlation between input variables is high, the predictive performance of the model decreases due to the multicollinearity problem.\n\nIn this notebook, we summarize the dimensionality reduction methods that can interpret data more intuitively by reducing features by reducing the dimensions of multidimensional features.\n\nThe dataset uses the commonly used **MNIST dataset**. The MNIST dataset we commonly use has a size of $28 x 28$. When looking at this dataset through dimensionality reduction, we will check if there is any regularity and how labels are clustered according to each dimensionality reduction method.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"---------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Loading library and dataset","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-09T05:56:36.837453Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-09T05:56:36.838219Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-09T05:56:36.864013Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-12-09T05:56:36.838085Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-12-09T05:56:36.863375Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The effect of each dimension reduction is identified using the MNIST dataset.

{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Introduction\n\nIn this workshop, I will show you how to build Artificial Neural Network(ANN) and how to tune its hyperparameters. I will use Digit Recognizer data set that is very famous among \"Kagglers\" who is specially interested in Neural Network. The data sets consist of the number of hand written digits that range from 0 to 9. The size og digits' photos er 28x28 which means each photo has 784 features(pixels). Also the data set consist of tran  and test sets. Train sets dimension is (42000x784) that means there are 42000 different photos in the train set while the test set dimension is (28000x784).\n\n**Metric:** I used \"accuracy metric\" as a metric to evaluate model performance.\n\n**Train set splitting:** I splitted the train set as %66 of train and 33% of dev set.\n\n<font color = 'blue'>\n Content:\n   \n   1.

We can tune hyperparameters such as:\n\nLearning Rate : It determines how quick the model will learn. It should be selected carefully. If it is small, the model speed will be very slow which means the derivative \nof loss function goes to its minimum point very slowly. If it is very high, the derivative of the loss fucntion cannot reach to its global minimum point. \nTherefore I preffered to choose its values as 1e-2, 1e-3, 1e-4.\n\nThe number of nodes: Nodes are points of the Layers on ANN. We need to optimize them and it is very general that they can be choosen as 32,64,128,256 and 512. \n\nThe number of layer: It determines the complexity of the ANN model like the nodes. If you choose very high number, it can result in \"BİAS\". If you choose very small like 2,\nit may not be good to solve complex and non-linear problems. We use dense function to create layers.\n\nActivation function: Normally ANN is the linear method (Z=W*X+b), but we use activation function to make ANN non-linear. The most famous activation functions are relu and \ntanh for layers. If you use binary classification, you need to use \"sigmoid\" funcion. If you classify more than 2 classes, you need to use \"softmax\" function.\n\nL2 Regularization: Regularization is used to reduce \"VARİANCE\" problem. One of the regularization techniques is L2 that is added to loss function to punish the weights.\nBy doing this weights getting closer to zero which reduces the model complexity.\n\nDropout: It is another regularization techniues. It is based on to close some of nodes randomly in determined layers. It uses \"BERNOULLİ PROBABLİTY\" to determine which nodes \nis getting closed. It is very effective like L2 regularization. It is very commen to use both L2 and Dropout regularization.\n\nAdam optimazation: There are different optimazation methods like \"momentum\" and \"RMSProp\" to speed the model and increase the model performance. \"ADAM\" optimization technique\nuses noth momentum and RMSProp(Root Mean Square Prop)\n\nBatch-size : It is based on to divide data into small datasets and train them. It increase the performance beside speeding model training time. Exponentially weighted avarages \nstatistical technique is used to calculate avarage loss on this technique. \n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\nclass AnnHyperModel(HyperModel): \n    def __init__(self, input_shape):\n        self.input_shape = input_shape\n        \n        \n    def build(self, hp):\n        model = Sequential()\n        model.add(\n            layers.Dense(\n                units=hp.Int('units', 8, 64, 4, default=8), \n                activation=hp.Choice(\n                    'dense_activation', \n                    values=['relu', 'tanh', 'elu'],\n                    default='relu'), \n                activity_regularizer=tf.keras.regularizers.l2(0.001),\n                input_shape=input_shape) )\n        \n        model.add( \n            layers.Dense(\n            units=hp.Int('units', 8, 64, 4, default=16), \n            activation=hp.Choice(\n                'dense_activation', \n                values=['relu', 'tanh', 'elu'], \n                default='relu')))\n\n        model.add( \n            layers.Dropout(\n                hp.Float( \n                    'dropout',\n                    min_value=0.0, \n                    max_value=0.1, \n                    default=0.005, \n                    step=0.01)))\n        \n    \n        model.add(layers.Dense(10,activation = \"softmax\"))\n        \n        model.compile(\n            optimizer=keras.optimizers.Adam(\n            hp.Choice('learning_rate',\n                      values=[1e-2, 1e-3, 1e-4]),\n                      beta_1=0.9,\n                      beta_2=0.999,\n                      epsilon=1e-07)\n            ,loss='mse',\n            metrics=['accuracy'] )\n\n        return model","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Ceate the object from the class\ninput_shape = (X_train.shape[1],)\nhypermodel = AnnHyperModel(input_shape)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from kerastuner.tuners import RandomSearch","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# RandomSearch is here to do the hyperparameter search. \n# For more tuners: https://keras-team.github.io/keras-tuner/documentation/tuners/\ntuner_rs = RandomSearch( hypermodel,\n                        objective='val_accuracy', \n                        seed=42, \n                        max_trials=12)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# You can print a summary of the search space\ntuner_rs.search_space_summary()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# fit the model to find best model\ntuner_rs.search(X_train, y_onehot_train, epochs=10, validation_data=(X_test, y_onehot_test), verbose=2)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# choosing best model among the models\nbest_model = tuner_rs.get_best_models(num_models=1)[0] \nloss, mse = best_model.evaluate(X_test,y_onehot_test)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Shows layers of the model\nbest_model.layers","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Shows weights of the model (w,b)\nbest_model.weights","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# used to see the content of the model.

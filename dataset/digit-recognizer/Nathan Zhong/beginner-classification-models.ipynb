K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier is an algorithm where each data point is grouped based on their neighbor's labels. For example, if data point x is close to five other data points which are labelled 2, the classifeir will label data point x as 2 as well. \n\n![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dyd911kmh/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:best/v1531424125/KNN_final1_ibdm8a.png)\n\nEspecially for this dataset, where each number is fairly distinct and different, KNN classifier should work well, as it can create clear distinctions between the different groups and points. There are still a couple parameters we have to specify, though. \n\nFirst, we have the n_neighbors parameter, which denotes how many neighbors we should compare each point with. Remember to keep in mind how large your training data is and how distinct your labels are, as too many neighbors many result in large influences from wrong labels and groups. \n\n![](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/mlc-downloads/downloads/03faee64-e85e-4ea0-a2b4-e5964949e2d1/d99b9a4d-618c-45f0-86d1-388bdf852c1d/images/screenshot.gif)\n\nI also defined the weight parameter, which dictates how much of an impact each neighbor has on the selection of the final label. By default, the weight is set to \"uniform\", which means every point is weighted the same, but I will be using the \"distance\" weight, as closer points will have a larger impact on the point than farther away points.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_x,val_x,train_y,val_y = train_test_split(x,y,random_state=32)\n\nmodel = KNeighborsClassifier (n_neighbors=5,weights = 'distance')\nmodel.fit(train_x,train_y)\npreds = model.predict(val_x)\nscore = accuracy_score(preds,val_y)*100\nprint('Error: ',score)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Seems like this model trained really well! Let's try out some different models before we decide on this one.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Training the XGBoost Classifier**","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"XGBoost, otherwise known as eXtreme Gradient Boosting, is a great resource to train gradient boosted decision trees fast and accurately. It has an option to use either trees or linear models, and there are several other parameters for you to choose from. For this model, I will be using a decision tree because I am doing a classification task.\n\nDecision trees are \"flowchart-like\" structures, where each node represents a \"test\" on an attribute, and each branch representing a different outcome. Each attribute will help differentiate each input from the next, until ultimately they reach the final layer, which is their class.\n\n![](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~bhiksha/courses/10-601/decisiontrees/DT.png)\n\nFor this data, the tree method should work out pretty well, especially because each number will cover different pixels, so different combinations of pixels should be a pretty strong way to differentiate between the labels. Most of the hyperparameters needed to train a XGBoost model will be discovered through extensive hyperparameter testing and optimization, so I will just train the base model for now. The main parameter to keep in mind is the booster parameter, where you decide between a tree or linear model, but the default is set to tree so I will not have to specify anything.\n\n![](https://images.slideplayer.com/34/8334889/slides/slide_2.jpg)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"xgboost = XGBClassifier()\nxgboost.fit(train_x,train_y)\npreds = xgboost.predict(val_x)\nscore = accuracy_score(preds,val_y)*100\nprint('Error: ',score)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Great!

Naive Bayes is a probabilistic model, which uses probability to make its classification choices. It applies the Bayes Theorm, which describes the probability of an event based on prior infromation, with a strong assumption of independence between the features. This makes Naive Bayes probably not the best classifier for this kind of problem, since each number relies on combinations of other features, but it is worth a try nonetheless. Naive Bayes Classifier can be coupled with Kernel Density Estimation, creating a much more complex model, but I will be training their base models for now.\n\n[](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcSa45V9W5m-QAT52tI5bCz868OGNDRsUWwn1c_nTPuttFLJaI8%3Ahttps%3A%2F%2Fuc-r.github.io%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fanalytics%2Fnaive_bayes%2Fnaive_bayes_icon.png&usqp=CAU)\n\nI will be training a Multinomial, Gaussian, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes Classifier. First, the Multinomial classifier is a Naive Bayes model based off a Multinomial distribution. Here, the model is able to handle discrete values better and are used more when there are integer values rather than boolean.\n\n![](https://blogs.sas.com/content/iml/files/2013/08/multinomial.png)\n\nGaussian distribution is similar except it uses the Gaussian distrubtion to predict. Therefore, the distribution is preset, regardless of the data, and using the normal Gaussian distribution, the Naive Bayes model is able to make its predictions.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/24000/1*IdGgdrY_n_9_YfkaCh-dag.png)\n\nFinally, I will be training a Bernoulli Naive Bayes Classifer. This basically implements a binomial distribution, which is similar to the multinomial distribution, except it uses 0 and 1s in a boolean fashion. Therefore, values are either present or not, whereas the count of the value is obsolete. This model should technically be the best one to use on our model.\n\n![](https://www.mathworks.com/help/examples/stats/win64/CompareBinomialAndNormalDistributionPdfsExample_01.png)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"nb = MultinomialNB()\nnb.fit(train_x,train_y)\npreds = nb.predict(val_x)\nscore = accuracy_score(preds,val_y)* 100\nprint('Error: ', score)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"gnb = GaussianNB()\ngnb.fit(train_x,train_y)\npreds = gnb.predict(val_x)\nscore = accuracy_score(preds,val_y)* 100\nprint('Error: ', score)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"bnb = BernoulliNB()\nbnb.fit(train_x,train_y)\npreds = bnb.predict(val_x)\nscore = accuracy_score(preds,val_y)* 100\nprint('Error: ', score)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Yikes, this classifier performed way worse than the other two.

By making your very own \"Customized\" Data Generator in Keras!"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"If you like this notebook, please consider giving an <span style='color:red;font-size:25px'>Upvote!</span>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Imports\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport cv2\nimport random\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\n\nimport tensorflow as tf","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Read the data\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"../input/digit-recognizer/train.csv\")\ntest_data = pd.read_csv(\"../input/digit-recognizer/test.csv\")\n\ndata.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_data = data[:40000]\nvalid_data = data[40000:]\n\nprint(train_data.shape, valid_data.shape)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So here's the juicy part!\nI'll now explain the below class.\n\nSo the `DigitDataGenerator(tf.keras.utils.Sequence)` is the custom Data Generator we'll be making.\n\n* The `tf.keras.utils.Sequence` is basically a module from Keras that we need to use if we want to make our own data generators.\n* Every Data Generator class needs to have atleast the following 3 functions:\n    * The `__init__()` function:\n        * This is the constructor function that will be called when we make the objects of this class.\n        * You can do data splitting, reshaping and everything in here.\n        * You should always get the batch size when object is instantiated (it'll be useful later).\n    * The `__len__()` function:\n        * This function will return the number of batches in the data set.\n        * It will be calculated using the formula:  $batches = \\frac{trainingSamples}{batchSize}$\n    * The `__getitem__()` function:\n        * This functions is the main driver in this code.\n        * It takes `index` as an argument (the index is same as the indexes we use in lists, etc)\n        * This function does the following:\n            * It calculates the current batch indexes for all the data that you will return.\n            * For example: `batch_images = self.images[index * self.batch_size : (index + 1) * self.batch_size]` takes the list of all the images and calculates the current batch (which starts from index * batch_size and goes to index+1 * batch_size).\n            * Since you want to return data in batches, you have to do this for all the different data you want to return.\n            * In this case, I am just returning the batched images and batched labels after converting them into a numpy array\n\nAnd this is basically it!

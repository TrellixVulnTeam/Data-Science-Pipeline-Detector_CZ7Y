From the GitHub:\n\n> Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) is a dimension reduction technique that can be used for visualisation similarly to t-SNE, but also for general non-linear dimension reduction.\n\n> The details for the underlying mathematics can be found in our paper on [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03426):  McInnes, L, Healy, J, UMAP: *Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection for Dimension Reduction*, ArXiv e-prints 1802.03426, 2018\n\n> The important thing is that you don't need to worry about that -- you can use UMAP right now for dimension reduction and visualisation as easily as a drop in replacement for scikit-learn's t-SNE.\n\nSounds great.

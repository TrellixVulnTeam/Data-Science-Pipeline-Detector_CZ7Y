Start here!\n\nWhether you're a Pythonista or a useR, there are five ways to use scripts and notebooks to start exploring datasets published on Kaggle using the in-browser code execution environment, Kernels. Fork any of the following kernels to quickly get your analyses off the ground.\n\n###Scripts\n\nScripts are a no-frills way to experiment with code. Most users rely on scripts when they want to train machine learning algorithms and write out a prediction file. But you can save data visualizations as well. Study and/or fork either the Python or R script below:\n\n* [Python Script][1]\n* [R Script][2]\n\n### Notebooks\n\nNotebooks are appealing because they combine narrative text written using easy-to-use markdown syntax with executable code. They create attractive reports that work well for tutorial-style content where code and text are both important. Study and/or fork either the Python or R notebook below:\n\n* [Python Notebook][3]\n* [R Notebook][4]\n\n### Rmarkdown\n\nFinally, Rmarkdown is perfect for creating visually appealing reports where the author wants more aesthetic control. You can choose to hide code in places where it's unnecessary for the write-up making Rmarkdown a great choice for data journalism articles that emphasize narrative and data visualization. Study or fork this Rmarkdown below (click on the \"code\" tab to see the underlying code):\n\n* [Rmarkdown Report][5]\n\n## What else?\n\nThere are a few other helpful things to know about using Kernels:\n\n* You can write out a prediction file to make a submission to the competition from any kernel.\n* Are we missing a package/library/module? Make a request on our [Product Feedback forum][6] and we'll work to get it added.\n* Plus, don't forget to upvote others' kernels you find helpful! You can find upvoted kernels on the \"Kernels\" tab of your profile for future reference.\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/mrisdal/digit-recognizer/starter-kernel-python-script\n  [2]: https://www.kaggle.com/bhanudaybirla/digit-recognizer/digit-recgnizer/code\n  [3]: https://www.kaggle.com/apapiu/digit-recognizer/t-sne\n  [4]: https://www.kaggle.com/olhacher/digit-recognizer/multinomial-logit-with-gradient-descent\n  [5]: https://www.kaggle.com/anthonykenny/digit-recognizer/quick-look-at-the-digits-data\n  [6]: https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback"}],"metadata":{"_change_revision":0,"_is_fork":false,"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.6.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}

So, here is my take on it. And I will be using PyTorch to solve it. I haven't yet found a detailed solution of the MNIST with PyTorch on Kaggle, so I figured I'd make my own one.\n\nI will be using fully connected neural net and batched learning algorithm. This model is *far from perfect*, but I tried to make it as *simple* as it gets and explain every step of this solution. If you are a beginner and interested in PyTorch, hopefully, this will be helpful to you.\n\nSo, with that being said, let's start with imports that we will need.\nFirst of all, we need to import PyTorch. There are some common names for torch modules (like numpy is always named np):  torch.nn.functional is imported as F,  torch.nn is the core module, and is simply imported as nn.\nAlso, we will need numpy, of course. Plus, I used pyplot and seaborn for some neat visualization, but they are not required for the network itself. \nAnd finally, I used pandas for importing and transforming data. You can probably do it without pandas in a much better way, but I just felt like using it, so why not."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"2945bec027bb7b48141bc406ccb6ecb19d240aaf","_cell_guid":"9c846800-05b5-40e4-9899-e3c5e6a149ba","collapsed":true,"trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nimport torch.optim as optim\nfrom torch.autograd import Variable\n\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"dc797b7df7d886a974e0fd36a7e30da01159875b","_cell_guid":"7ef86f98-c394-4595-8675-e2539ea2332d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now we can import and transform the data.

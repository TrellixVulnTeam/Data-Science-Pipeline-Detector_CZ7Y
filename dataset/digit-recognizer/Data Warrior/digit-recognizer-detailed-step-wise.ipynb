We will the Sequential API, where you just add on one layer at a time, starting from the input.\n\nThe most important part are the convolutional layers Conv2D. Here they have 16-32 filters that use nine weights each to transform a pixel to a weighted average of itself and its eight neighbors. As the same nine weights are used over the whole image, the net will pick up features that are useful everywhere. As it is only nine weights, we can stack many convolutional layers on top of each other without running out of memory/time. \n\nThe MaxPooling layers just look at four neighboring pixels and picks the maximal value. This reduces the size of the image by half, and by combining convolutional and pooling layers, the net be able to combine its features to learn more global features of the image. In the end we use the features in two fully-connected (Dense) layers.\n\nBatch Normalization is a technical trick to make training faster. Dropout is a regularization method, where the layer randomly replaces  a proportion of its weights to zero for each training sample. This forces the net to learn features in a distributed way, not relying to much on a particular weight, and therefore improves generalization.

We use it to fit models and search for optimal parameters, but scikit-learn sometimes works for hours, if not days. Speeding up this process is something anyone who uses scikit-learn would be interested in.\n\nI want to show you how to get results faster without changing the code. To do this, we will use another Python library, **[scikit-learn-intelex](https://github.com/intel/scikit-learn-intelex)**. It accelerates scikit-learn and does not require you changing the code written for scikit-learn.\n\nI will use a Kaggle notebook in which the training of the KNN model executed in **over 35 minutes**.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd, numpy as np\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, KFold\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train = pd.read_csv('../input/digit-recognizer/train.csv')\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/digit-recognizer/test.csv')\n\nx_train = train[train.columns[1:]]\nx_test = test\ny_train = train[train.columns[0]]\n\ntrain.head()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's take the training and predict into a separate function:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def train_predict():\n    from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\n    knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)\n    knn.fit(x_train, y_train)\n    return knn.predict(test)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\ny_pred_original = train_predict()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The training of the KNN model took **almost 35 minutes**.

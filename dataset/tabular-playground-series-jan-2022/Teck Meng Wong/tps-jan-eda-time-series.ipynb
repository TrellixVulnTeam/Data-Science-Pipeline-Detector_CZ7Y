In time series, this means that the present value is linearly dependent on its past values.\n\nThe autoregressive process is denoted as AR(p) where p is the order. The general expression of an AR(p) model is:\ny t = C + ϕ 1 y t −1 + ϵ t + ϕ 2 y t −2 + ϵ t +⋅⋅⋅ + ϕ p y t −p + ϵ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The next step is learning how to treat time series where you cannot infer an order from the ACF plot nor from the PACF plot. This means that both figures exhibit a slowly decaying pattern or a sinusoidal pattern. In such case, we are in the presence of an autoregressive moving average process or ARMA. This denotes the combination of both the autoregressive and moving average processes.\n\nWe will examine the autoregressive moving average process or ARMA(p,q), where p denotes the order of the autoregressive portion, and q denotes the order of the moving average portion. Furthermore, we will not be able to use the ACF and PACF plots to determine the orders q and p respectively, as both plots will show either a slowly decaying or sinusoidal pattern. Thus, we will define a general modeling procedure that will\nallow us to model such complex time series. This procedure involves model selection using the Akaike’s Information Criterion or AIC, which will determine the optimal combination of p and q for our series. Then, we must evaluate the models’ validity using residual analysis, by studying the correlogram, Q-Q plot and density plot of the model’s residuals in order to assess if they closely resemble white noise. If that is the case, we can move on to forecasting our time series using the ARMA(p,q) model.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from statsmodels.tsa.arima_process import ArmaProcess\nimport numpy as np\nnp.random.seed(42)\nar1 = np.array([1, -0.33])\nma1 = np.array([1, 0.9])\nARMA_1_1 = ArmaProcess(ar1, ma1).generate_sample(nsample=1000)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-29T09:41:28.084161Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-29T09:41:28.084471Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-29T09:41:28.091737Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-29T09:41:28.084428Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-29T09:41:28.090841Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from itertools import product\nps = range(0, 8, 1)\nqs = range(0, 8, 1)\norder_list = list(product(ps, qs))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-29T09:41:28.093256Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-29T09:41:28.09414Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-29T09:41:28.102982Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-29T09:41:28.094095Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-29T09:41:28.102108Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from typing import Union\nfrom tqdm.notebook import tqdm\nfrom statsmodels.tsa.statespace.sarimax import SARIMAX\ndef optimize_ARMA(endog: Union[pd.Series, list], order_list: list):\n    results = []\n    for order in tqdm(order_list):\n        try:\n            model = SARIMAX(endog, order=(order[0], 0, order[1]),simple_differencing=False).fit(disp=False)\n        except:\n            continue\n        aic = model.aic\n        results.append([order, aic])\n    result_df = pd.DataFrame(results)\n    result_df.columns = ['(p,q)', 'AIC']\n    #Sort in ascending order, lower AIC is better\n    result_df = result_df.sort_values(by='AIC',\n        ascending=True).reset_index(drop=True)\n    return result_df","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-29T09:41:28.104275Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-29T09:41:28.104971Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-29T09:41:28.120683Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-29T09:41:28.104923Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-29T09:41:28.119752Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"result_df = optimize_ARMA(train_subset[column_y], order_list) #A\nresult_df","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-29T09:41:28.123174Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-29T09:41:28.123408Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-29T09:44:39.713948Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-29T09:41:28.123379Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-29T09:44:39.712982Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Seasonal","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"With time series decomposition, we can clearly identify and visualize the seasonal component of a time series.

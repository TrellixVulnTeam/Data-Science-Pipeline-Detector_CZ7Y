I'll try to look through this dataset, do some EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and try to build a story using beautiful yet impactful open-source visualization tool - Flourish. Flourish makes it easy to visualize data using easy approaches without need of code. Interactive data dashboarding to analytics storytelling, that's what I wish to explore in the Playground Jan 22' Series.  \n\nThis data doesn't simulates a real-world environment, but data storytelling is a fun thing to do.

Scikit-learn doesn't offer SMAPE as a loss function. As a workaround, I'm training for Huber loss with a transformed target, apply a correction factor, and we'll see how far we'll get.\n\nThe transformed target for the regression is the log of the sales numbers.\n\n#### What did you not understand about this process?\nWell, everything provides in the competition data page. I've no problem while working on it. If you guys don't understand the thing that I'll do in this notebook then please comment on this notebook.\n\nWhat else do you think you can try as part of this approach?\nLook at a notebook which presents feature engineering (based on the insights of this EDA) and a linear model which makes use of the features.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"All credit goes to - https://www.kaggle.com/bernhardklinger/tps-jan-2022 ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**I Hope you find this notebook useful , Good Luck!**","metadata":{}}]}

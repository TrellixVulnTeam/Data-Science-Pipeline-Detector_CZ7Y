Additionally, Android users are the minority and don't book that often. **It makes perfect business sense to invest more resources in improving the user experience of iOS apps.** On the other hand, Airbnb could also investigate into the smaller conversion rate of Android Users and try to deduce some correlation with certain quirks of the Android Airbnb App.\n* Desktop Users book far more often than other device users. **This could mean that people use smaller devices for surfing and exploration and desktops to make the actual booking.** The User Experience for the apps on different devices  must be tuned accordingly to achieve best results.\n* Most of the Airbnb Users tend to book an Airbnb within the country. **Therefore, it makes most sense to give the users more recommendations that are endemic to the country.** American users should get more Experience and Host recommendations within the USA. This is not the case with the current Airbnb site where most recommendations are that of exotic locations in faraway places.\n* People who haven't filled out their information such as Age and Gender are the least likely to book Airbnbs. This is likely due to the fact that they are only in the exploration stage. **Maximum marketing effort must be aimed at these people and the most enticing yet affordable offers must be made to them to increase their rate of conversion.**","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Conclusion\n\n![](http://www.clevver.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/world-without-books-gifs-imagination.gif)","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"This notebook demonstrated all the major steps that take place in performig data analysis and predictive modeling in a typical data science problem. The data was wrangled and cleaned. This was followed by some inferential statistics to deduce relationships between features. Extensive EDA was performed to gain insights on the data and these insights were used to extract and engineer new features.\n\nFinally, several classifiers were considered and the **Gradient Boosting Classfier** was selected and its paramters were tuned. This classifer was used to predict the destination of our test users and a submission file was created in the format suggested by Airbnb.\n\nThe Official Kaggle Score obtained was **0.86527.** This score can, of course, be improved through more hyperparameter tuning and more advanced feature engineering but the improvement is extremely minimal (considering that the highest score was 0.88). I will therefore conclude this notebook here. Thank you!","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"execution_count":null,"outputs":[],"metadata":{"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":""}]}

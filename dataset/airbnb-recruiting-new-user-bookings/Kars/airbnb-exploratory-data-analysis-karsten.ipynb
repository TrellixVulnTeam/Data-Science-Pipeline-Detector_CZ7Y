The notebook will not be edited and formatted as a final draft and edited because it will contain my thoughts and steps through the dataset. A polished one can be released upon request.\n\n## The Dataset\nWe are given a list of users with information such as their demographics, web session records, and summary statistics. The purpose of this dataset is to predict where a new user would likely to book for their first destination. All the users are from the US, and there are 12 possible outcomes: 'US', 'FR', 'CA', 'GB', 'ES', 'IT', 'PT', 'NL','DE', 'AU', 'NDF' (no destination found), and 'other'. NDF and 'other' are separate. \n\nAs shown in the code above, we are given 6 datasets, countries, sessions, train users 2, age gender bkts, test uers, and sample submission. Train users and test users should hold the same type of information with the exception of the country destination/prediction. Countries would be the information on the destination countries. Sessions would be the web sessions for the users, and the age gender bkts for the statistics on the user. \n\nSince we have information being held in several different datasets, we might have to join datasets together or we can see if there is a master dataset that holds all the information so we do not have to look through the derivatives. In a dataset of this small size, it is more efficient for me to use one dataset instead of joining multiple datasets as I filter through each. \n\n## Theory\nHow would a professional predict where a person may want to go based on their behavior? A simple predictor would be to look at which locations was the audience looking at, in addition what was the click through rate or exploration of the listing. Time elapsed might have a positive correlation with interest, but anomalies such as extremely long viewing time or bounce rate times should be ignored as they will affect the prediction. How many returns to a certain country page may also indicate interest in a country. There is not too much that I understand about Airbnb's customers so I will begin Data Analysis.

It might mean that there are missing variables.\n- signup_flow is an integer, and it is a position of where the customer signed up for an account. This implies that this variable is ordinal. \n- Language could show some relationship to location, as some people prefer to travel to locations where there is not an extreme language barrier. There are those who prefer the inverse. \n- Since there are only 88908 first bookings, we may expect many country_destination data rows to be NDF.

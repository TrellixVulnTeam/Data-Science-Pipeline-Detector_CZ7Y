To me, this score is a combination of Popularity and Eye-catching-ness (Is it a word at all?) of that image. A person first needs to be interested in a pet (cat or dog or the breed, etc), then how eye-catching the image is? How does the background color impact? How does the pet position in the image impact? Is the pet far from the camera or close to it. I call all these features as eye-catching-ness (what is the correct word?!). \n\nYou need to pay a close attention to this fact when you augment the images for generalization. You cannot zoom in or zoom out too much, or rotate the image too much. Maybe by zooming out the image, the pet face gets too small and loses its Pawpularity score because it is no longer as eye-catching (adorable) as before. Shifting horizontally and vertically is probably less impactful. \n\nImage augmention for classification is slightly different. If you rotate the image of a car or a dog even for 90 degree, it is still a car or a dog, respectively. But this is not true when we deal with this specific problem (Pawpularity score). \n\nSo, there is a sweet spot.

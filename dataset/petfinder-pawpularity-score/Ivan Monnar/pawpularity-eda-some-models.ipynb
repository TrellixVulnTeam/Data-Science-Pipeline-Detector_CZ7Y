PetFinder collaborates closely with animal lovers, media, corporations, and global organizations to improve animal welfare.\n\nCurrently, PetFinder.my uses a basic Cuteness Meter to rank pet photos. It analyzes picture composition and other factors compared to the performance of thousands of pet profiles. While this basic tool is helpful, it's still in an experimental stage and the algorithm could be improved.\n\n### Features\n\n* Focus - Pet stands out against uncluttered background, not too close / far.\n* Eyes - Both eyes are facing front or near-front, with at least 1 eye / pupil decently clear.\n* Face - Decently clear face, facing front or near-front.\n* Near - Single pet taking up significant portion of photo (roughly over 50% of photo width or height).\n* Action - Pet in the middle of an action (e.g., jumping).\n* Accessory - Accompanying physical or digital accessory / prop (i.e. toy, digital sticker), excluding collar and leash.\n* Group - More than 1 pet in the photo.\n* Collage - Digitally-retouched photo (i.e. with digital photo frame, combination of multiple photos).\n* Human - Human in the photo.\n* Occlusion - Specific undesirable objects blocking part of the pet (i.e. human, cage or fence). Note that not all * blocking objects are considered occlusion.\n* Info - Custom-added text or labels (i.e. pet name, description).\n* Blur - Noticeably out of focus or noisy, especially for the pet’s eyes and face. For Blur entries, “Eyes” column is always set to 0.\n\n### Goal\n\nOur goal is to predict the value of Pawpularity using the provided metadata, first finding out if this is possible by EDA.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Step 1.

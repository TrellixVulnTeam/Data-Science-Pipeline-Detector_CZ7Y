Specifically, we tried Decision Tree Classification, Decision Tree Regression, Ordinary Least Squares Regression, Ridge Regression, Bernoulli Naive Bayes Classification, Random Forest Regression, and Histogram-based Gradient Boosting Regression (LightGBM).\n\nTLDR on the first 2 Tutorials, all the metadata models suck because the metadata isn't strongly predictive of / correlated with the target class \"Pawpularity\". You could just guess the mean Pawpularity value for every image and get a similar RMSE score - which is what many of the models learned to do. Sometimes it's just not possible to build highly predictive models. Not because of the data you have collected, but because the target class may simply be a random distribution. Pawpularity may just not have much to do with the images themselves. That said, today we are going to see if we can lower our RMSE score by building models using the images. Specifically, we're going to explore basic Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers.\n\n**Score to beat: 20.52**\n\n**Index:**\n1. Load in the packages\n2. Get the data\n3.

Get the data\nThe trickiest part of modeling using images in my opinion is often getting them in the right format to be used by your ML model architectures. You need to know where your images are, and then turn them into the data types that can be accepted by your models. If your images are already in directories with their associated classes, there are some straighforward ways to read in the data. Imagine the file paths: /train/26/1239581345.jpg and /train/93/1239581345.jpg where the classes would be a pawpularity score of 26 in the first case and 93 in the second case. That is NOT the case for this competition.\n\nFor our purposes, an easy way to get our data is to:\n1. Get the image paths from train.csv and test.csv files. The image files are named the same as the Ids in the Id column of the csv's.\n2. Then, create a function that will preprocess all the images and put then into an array/tensor. At a basic level, you want to turn the all training images into one super big array. That is what will be fed into your ML model. So you don't feed the images in based on their image paths/URLs, you have to turn them all into a single array/tensor before the model can be fit to the images.\n3.

It can get quite complicated when you have different layers of your network interacting with eachother. For our example, we'll stick to a basic architecture and explain each step. Basically:\n* [tf.keras.layers.Conv2D](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Conv2D) - defines a convolutional layer and you can mess with parameters\n* [tf.keras.layers.BatchNormalization](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/BatchNormalization) - Batch normalization applies a transformation that maintains the mean output close to 0 and the output standard deviation close to 1.\n* [tf.keras.layers.Dropout](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/Dropout) - The Dropout layer randomly sets input units to 0 with a frequency of rate at each step during training time, which helps prevent overfitting.\n* [tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/layers/MaxPool2D) - a way to perform dimensionality reduction by taking the max value in the pool along strides.\n* **strides** - The strides parameter is a 2-tuple of integers, specifying the “step” of the convolution along the x and y axis of the input volume. This can sometimes be used instead of doing max pooling. Reduces volume.\n* **kernel_size** - The size of the kernel. A kernel is a filter that is used to extract the features from the images. The kernel is a matrix that moves over the input data, performs the dot product with the sub-region of input data, and gets the output as the matrix of dot products\n* **padding** - Can be \"valid\" or \"same\" (case-insensitive). \"valid\" means no padding. \"same\" results in padding with zeros evenly to the left/right or up/down of the input such that output has the same height/width dimension as the input.\n* *kernel_regularizer=l2(0.0002)* - performing regularization can help prevent overfitting. That's when your model is to attuned to the training data and doesn't generalize well. So you might be really good on your training metrics, but then your predictions could be totally off. The smaller the value applied here, the less impact it'll have. \n\nYou may also see this look different, where some people like to use .add() to add layers to their model architecture. So you might see something like:\n\n* model_a = tf.keras.models.Sequential()\n* model_a.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu', input_shape=(128,128,3), data_format=\"channels_last\"))\n* model_a.add(BatchNormalization())\n* model_a.add(MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))\n* model_a.add(Dropout(0.5))\n* model_a.add(Conv2D(32, (3, 3), activation='relu'))\n* model_a.add(Flatten())\n* model_a.add(Dense(32, activation='relu'))\n* model_a.add(BatchNormalization())\n* model_a.add(Dropout(0.5))\n* model_a.add(Dense(1, activation='linear')) \n\nThis is acceptable too in most cases. My personal preference is to use this format you'll see coded below. \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#define the inputs to your model.

We'll specify 3 necessary things, that will guide the training and the behaviour of the model itself, as well as be the conceptual anchor points to which we can stick when thinking about optimising models and improving performance: \n* A **loss function** indicates how the model is behaving while dealing with training data. It's a direct measure of the distance between what the model is producing, and what it should be. Beware of aiming at getting a perfect behaviour of the model on the training data! You'd fall into the overfitting trap: you're model would perfectly learn the training data by heart, but would be unable to generalise predictions to new and previously unseen data\n* An **optimiser** consists of the actual math behind which the model updates its parameters according to the loss function results, to try to get the best training performance. Generally speaking, optimisation is based on gradient methods, that compile derivatives of the loss with regards to the parameters of the models, and different variants exist. We'll select the Adam optimiser, a well-known and well-suited optimiser for computer vision problems.\n* A **performance metric** gives us, the computer scientists, a real figure of how things are going once the model has finished its work. Selecting a performance metric mostly depends on the problem at hand. Here we're performing regression, we'll then look at the actual distance between the predictions made by the model and the truth (roughly).

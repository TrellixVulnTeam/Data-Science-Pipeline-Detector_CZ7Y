Each of these features is binary, meaning they are either present or absent in the image. These features are:\n\n1. **Focus** - Pet stands out against the uncluttered background, not too close / far.\n2. **Eyes** - Both eyes are facing front or near-front, with at least 1 eye/pupil decently clear.\n3. **Face** - Decently clear face, facing front or near-front.\n4. **Near** - Single pet taking up a significant portion of photo (roughly over 50% of photo width or height).\n5. **Action** - Pet in the middle of an action (e.g., jumping).\n6. **Accessory** - Accompanying physical or digital accessory/prop (i.e. toy, digital sticker), excluding collar and leash.\n7. **Group** - More than 1 pet in the photo.\n8. **Collage** - Digitally-retouched photo (i.e. with digital photo frame, a combination of multiple photos).\n9. **Human** - Human in the photo.\n10. **Occlusion** - Specific undesirable objects blocking part of the pet (i.e. human, cage, or fence). Note that not all blocking objects are considered occlusion.\n11. **Info** - Custom-added text or labels (i.e. pet name, description).\n12. **Blur** - Noticeably out of focus or noisy, especially for the pet’s eyes and face. For Blur entries, “Eyes” column is always set to 0.\n\nBefore discussing why these features are needed, let's check how the pawpularity score is affected by the presence of a certain feature.

A few things that we can notice from this plot:\n\n1. Although one would expect **Subject Focus** to be a very important feature for making a photo popular, in this case, it hardly contributes to a high score.\n2. **Eyes, Face, and Near (Single Pet)** are the only three features that are dominant for a popularity score of more than 50. These are the only features that contributed most to  a score of 100\n3. A group photo with other pets/humans doesn't give a good score\n4. Collage, as expected, doesn't improve the score. The distribution of scores with/without Collage is the same\n5. **Blur(Out of focus or noisy)** tends to decrease the score as expected. Most blurred photos scored between 20-30\n6. Any pet doing an action in a photo doesn't make the pet more attractive, hence the score isn't affected at all\n\n\n## Why are the features important?\n\nEngagement with a photo depends very much on the **aesthetics** of a photo. To give you a simple example, a not-so good looking pet (Sorry, every pet is cute! Here I am just talking in terms of the photo), would look cuter with a focus on the features of the pet rather than a good looking pet doing some weird trick far away from the camera. \n\nAnd aesthetics isn't just that. The term aesthetics itself is very broad as it depends very much on an individual perception of a photo. \"How to capture aesthetics of a photo in an ML model\" is an open research area. So, instead of just looking at raw photos and trying to predict an engagement/pawpularity score is much harder than predicting the score for the same photo but with additional features that aren't directly captured in a simple model, especially traditional ML models ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"image_paths = []\nlabels = []\ncustom_texts = []\n\nfor col in FEATURES:\n    tmp_df = train_df[train_df[col] == 1]\n    for i in range(4):\n        image_paths.append(tmp_df.iloc[i, :]['img_path'])\n        labels.append(col)\n        target = str(tmp_df.iloc[i, :][TARGET])\n        meta = tmp_df.iloc[i, :][FEATURES + ['width', 'height']].values\n        meta = ''.join([f'{col}:{m}, ' for m, col in zip(meta, FEATURES + ['width', 'height'])])\n        custom_texts.append(f'target: {target}\\n{meta}')\n    tmp_df = train_df[train_df[col] == 0]\n    \n#Visualizing feature-wise image\nipyplot.plot_class_tabs(image_paths, labels, custom_texts=custom_texts, force_b64=True, img_width=450)","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Feature Analysis","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\ntrain_df.nica.mass_plot(\n    plt_set = FEATURES,\n    columns = 3,\n    plottype = \"countplot\")","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Plot the correlation Heatmap\n\ndata_corr = train_df[FEATURES + [TARGET]].corr()\nplt.figure(figsize = (15,15))\ndataplot = sns.heatmap(data_corr, annot=True)\n  \nplt.show()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"However, the features have a low correlation to the target variable.

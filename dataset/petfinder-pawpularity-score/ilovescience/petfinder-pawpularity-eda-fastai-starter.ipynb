If successful, solutions will be adapted into AI tools that will guide shelters and rescuers around the world to improve the appeal of their pet profiles, automatically enhancing photo quality and recommending composition improvements. As a result, stray dogs and cats can find families much faster, and these tools will help improve animal welfare.\n\nIn this notebook, I will present a quick 'n dirty EDA and a (image-only, for now) fastai starter. \n\n**EDIT (12/18): This new version fixes a major bug that was present before for the metric calculation. Before, the metric was calculated per batch and averaged across all batches which is incorrect for the RMSE metric.

In [Tutorial Part 1: EDA for Beginners ](https://www.kaggle.com/alexteboul/tutorial-part-1-eda-for-beginners/notebook), we covered the exploratory data analysis process from start to finish for the PetFinder.my Pawpularity Contest. If you'd like to learn more about how to explore and visualize both the metadata and image data for this competition, check out that notebook.\n\n**To recap some important findings from that exploration:**\n* The feature variables are all binary, 0s or 1s, while the target variable (Pawpularity) is 1-100.\n* The feature variables appear to have similar distributions of pawpularity scores, between themselves and their respective classes (0s vs 1s).\n* The images are hard to differentiate in terms of Pawpularity score just by looking at them.\n\nIn this notebook, I'm going to cover how to build some simple models using the metadata provided in the competition. By metadata, I'm referring to the .csv training data in this contest. According to the competition hosts, this data was created manually by people looking at the pet pictures and has features like Eyes, Group, Blur, Face, etc.\n\n**In this notebook you'll learn about:**\n* Decision Tree Classification\n* Decision Tree Regression\n* Ordinary Least Squares Regression\n* Ridge Regression\n* Bernoulli Naive Bayes Classification\n* Random Forest Regression\n* Histogram-based Gradient Boosting Regression (LightGBM)\n* How to evaluate your models\n* Plan for next steps\n\n**TLDR:**\n* All the models kind of suck and it's the metadata-Pawpularity relationship that is bad. Unlikely that any amount of parameter tuning or different models will make these too much better. Best bet is to use the images themselves. Which I will demonstrate in Tutorial Part 3.\n\n| Model                                            | RMSE   |\n|--------------------------------------------------|--------|\n| 4.1 Decision Tree Regression                     | 20.857 |\n| 4.2 Decision Tree Classification                 | 22.900 |\n| 5.1 Ordinary Least Square Regression             | 20.827 |\n| 5.2 Ridge Regression                             | 20.827 |\n| 6.1 Bernoulli Naive Bayes Classification         | 23.468 |\n| 7.1 Random Forest Regression                     | 20.838 |\n| 7.2 Histogram-based Gradient Boosting Regression | 20.924 |\n\n**Index:**\n1.

Specifically, we tried Decision Tree Classification, Decision Tree Regression, Ordinary Least Squares Regression, Ridge Regression, Bernoulli Naive Bayes Classification, Random Forest Regression, and Histogram-based Gradient Boosting Regression (LightGBM). RMSE 20.54\n3. **In [Tutorial Part 3: CNN Image Models 1](https://www.kaggle.com/alexteboul/tutorial-part-3-cnn-image-modeling-1)**, we explored preprocessing the training images, explaining the data types necessary to model with images, a basic Convolutional Neural Network architecture, and submitting predictions.

Because we are given example data with both Pawpularity scores and feature data in the metadata .csv files, we know that we can at least treat this as a supervised learning problem. We have labels --> okay cool it's supervised learning. \n\nNext, we need to decide whether this is a classication (categorical variable prediction) or regression (continous variable prediction). As it turns out, we can do either method in this case. We can treat the Pawpularity score as a continous variable for our regression models to predict, or as a categorical variable between 1-100 for our classification models to predict. \n\nWhen our predictions are judged however, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) metric will be used to evaluate model success. RMSE is the square root of the variance of the residuals (your prediction errors). More plainly, residuals are a measure of how far off from the regression line data points are. The RMSE is a metric that evaluates how spread apart these residuals actually are. Basically, the smaller the RMSE you get, the better. Theoretically, if your model perfectly predicted everything, RMSE would be 0. RMSE is typically associated with regression evaluation.\n\n$$RMSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}{\\Big(\\frac{d_i -f_i}{\\sigma_i}\\Big)^2}}$$","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Example of RMSE\nexample_y_actual    = [10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80,90,100]\nexample_y_predicted = [12,20,35,45,50,30,50,80,92,95]\nexample_MSE = mean_squared_error(example_y_actual, example_y_predicted)\nexample_RMSE = math.sqrt(example_MSE)\nprint(\"Example Mean Squared Error:\", round(example_MSE,1))\nprint(\"Example Root Mean Square Error:\", round(example_RMSE,1))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-13T20:38:58.680576Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-13T20:38:58.680887Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-13T20:38:58.690139Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-13T20:38:58.680858Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-13T20:38:58.689324Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"-------","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3: Get the data\nFirst, load the data in from the train.csv so we can start training some models.

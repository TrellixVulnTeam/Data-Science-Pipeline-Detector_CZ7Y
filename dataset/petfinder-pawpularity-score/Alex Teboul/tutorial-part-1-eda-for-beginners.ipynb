In this series I will walk through different phases of the competition process, from EDA, to model building, model iteration, and beyond. I hope this series provides beginners some useful tools and  the confidence to progress in the space. \n\nFeel free to build off the code provided in these tutorials. Also, be sure to leave comments if you have any questions or if you have suggestions on how to improve the notebooks for others. If there is any code you would like help on, or model architectures you would like to see explored in future notebooks, be sure to let me know in the comments.\n\n**In this notebook you'll learn how to:**\n* Access the competition data\n* Display the .csv metadata for the competition\n* Visualize key characteristics of the .csv data\n* Build a simple function to display .jpg competition images\n* Analyze your findings\n* Create a plan for model building\n\n**Definition**: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of investigating key characteristics of datasets at the start of any project involving data. Before you can go on to build fancy machine learning models you've got to understand the basics of the dataset you're working with and the problem you're trying to solve. This involves loading in the data and visualizing it in the form of tables, charts, and sometimes images themselves.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Tutorials so far:**\n1. **In [Tutorial Part 1: EDA for Beginners](https://www.kaggle.com/alexteboul/tutorial-part-1-eda-for-beginners)**, we covered the exploratory data analysis process from start to finish for the PetFinder.my Pawpularity Contest.\n2. **In [Tutorial Part 2: Model Building using the Metadata](https://www.kaggle.com/alexteboul/tutorial-part-2-model-building-using-the-metadata)**, we built models using the metadata (.csv data) provided by the competition hosts. Specifically, we tried Decision Tree Classification, Decision Tree Regression, Ordinary Least Squares Regression, Ridge Regression, Bernoulli Naive Bayes Classification, Random Forest Regression, and Histogram-based Gradient Boosting Regression (LightGBM). RMSE 20.54\n3. **In [Tutorial Part 3: CNN Image Models 1](https://www.kaggle.com/alexteboul/tutorial-part-3-cnn-image-modeling-1)**, we explored preprocessing the training images, explaining the data types necessary to model with images, a basic Convolutional Neural Network architecture, and submitting predictions.

May be hard for an alogrithm to make use of this effectively.\n* I could not accurately predict pawpularity based on these images, which makes me think a machine learning algorithm is also going to have a hard time predicting pawpularity.\n* Sometimes, there is a problem that doesn't lend itself easily to machine learning models. This may be one of those cases. \n* It is possible that pawpularity is not based entirely on the pet pictures themselves. Perhaps the website mechanics or outside factors influence which pets are getting clicks and therefore high pawpularity scores.\n* Next, we will go forward with regression models using the metadata (.csv data).\n* Then, we will apply computer vision techniques and build models using the images themselves.

It analyzes picture composition and other factors compared to the performance of thousands of pet profiles. While this basic tool is helpful, it's still in an experimental stage and the algorithm could be improved. The participants needs to build an AI model using provided data to help make the tool better.  \n\n**Task** \n\nThe task is to predict engagement with a pet's profile( **Pawpularity** ) based on the photograph for that profile. \n\n**Data** \n\nThe dataset for this competition comprises both images and tabular data(hand-labelled metadata for each photo). \n\nThe train set contains 9912 pet photos \n\nThe test set contains 8 pet photos\n> NOTE: The actual test data comprises about **6800** pet photos similar to the training set photos. \n\n#### **The goal of this notebook is to:** \n\n1. Understand the structure of the data. ( image and tabular ) \n2. Understand the relation between image and tabular data. \n3. Understand the impact of image and tabular data deciding Pawpularity score. \n\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-01T14:49:46.888909Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-01T14:49:46.889428Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-01T14:49:48.174873Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-01T14:49:46.889323Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-01T14:49:48.173852Z"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Setting up the Notebook ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd \n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \nimport seaborn as sns \n\nimport os \nimport cv2\nimport random \n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-02T04:59:17.043312Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-02T04:59:17.043755Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-02T04:59:18.399962Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-02T04:59:17.043631Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-02T04:59:18.398982Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.core.display import display, HTML\ndisplay(HTML(\"<style>div.output_scroll { height: 70em; }</style>\"))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-02T04:59:18.40158Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-02T04:59:18.401847Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-02T04:59:18.411398Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-02T04:59:18.401818Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-02T04:59:18.410114Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.set(style= 'darkgrid', \n       color_codes=True,\n       font = 'Arial',\n       font_scale= 1.5,\n       rc={'figure.figsize':(12,8)})","metadata":{"scrolled":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-02T04:59:18.736849Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-02T04:59:18.737157Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-02T04:59:18.742775Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-02T04:59:18.737117Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-02T04:59:18.741775Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### A.

We'll train and test our model on PetFinder.my's thousands of pet profiles. Winning versions will offer accurate recommendations that will improve animal welfare.\n\n#### Why are you trying it?\nPetFinder.my is Malaysia’s leading animal welfare platform, featuring over 180,000 animals with 54,000 happily adopted. PetFinder collaborates closely with animal lovers, media, corporations, and global organizations to improve animal welfare.\n\nCurrently, PetFinder.my uses a basic Cuteness Meter to rank pet photos. It analyzes picture composition and other factors compared to the performance of thousands of pet profiles. While this basic tool is helpful, it's still in an experimental stage and the algorithm could be improved.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many

With a little assistance from the Kaggle community, many precious lives could be saved and more happy families created.\n\n#### What did you not understand about this process?\nWell, everything provides in the competition data page. I've no problem while working on it. If you guys don't understand the thing that I'll do in this notebook then please comment on this notebook.\n\n#### What else do you think you can try as part of this approach?\nIn this competition, our task is to predict engagement with a pet's profile based on the photograph for that profile.","metadata":{}}]}

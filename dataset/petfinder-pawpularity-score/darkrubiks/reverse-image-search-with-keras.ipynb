The feature vectors (also called embeddings or bottleneck features) are essentially a collection of a few thousand floating-point values. Going through the convolution and pooling layers in a CNN is basically an act of reduction, to filter the information contained in the image to its most important and salient constituents, which in turn form the bottleneck features. Training the CNN molds these values in such a way that items belonging to the same class have small Euclidean distance between them (or simply the square root of the sum of squares of the difference between corresponding values) and items from different classes are separated by larger distances. This is an important property that helps solve so many problems where a classifier can’t be used, especially in unsupervised problems because of a lack of adequate labeled data.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Feature Extraction\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Load the ResNet-50 model without the top classification layers, so we get only the bottleneck features.

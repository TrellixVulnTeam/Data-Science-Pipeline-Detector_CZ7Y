By decreasing the point value of each regular shot, we are essentially making free throws more valuable as well. Furthermore, a player would still get their typical 2 free throws for a shooting foul, effectively making a foul worth more than actually scoring. Physically imposing teams that are able to draw more fouls would likely have the upper hand in this scenario."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From this analysis, we can conclude that the value ratio between the different types of shots plays an important role in a team's performance and strategy. If the score of each shot were increased by 1 point, the number of wins in each year would have changed by a total of 26. If the score is decreased by 1 point, the number of wins in each year would have changed by a total of 36. Thus, fouls play a larger role when scores are decreased, in which case we would recommend avoiding fouling as much as possible. The same may be said when increasing each shot by 1 point; however, fouls play a smaller role in this scenario."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So when it comes to basketball shot selection, your decision should depend on how much your shot is worth.

Introduction</h2>\n\n\n<h3>1.1 The Problem</h3> <br>\n<p>New York is riddled with one-ways, small side streets, and an almost incalculable amount of pedestrians at any given point in time. Not to mention the amount of cars/motorcycles/bicycles clogging up the roads. Combine this with a mad rush to get from point A to point B, and you'll find yourself late for whatever you need to be on time for.</p>\n\n<p>The solution to getting from A to B when living in a city like New York (without losing your mind) is easy: take a taxi/Uber/Lyft/etc. You don't need to stress about the traffic or pedestrians and you have a moment to do something else, like catch up on emails. Although this sounds simple enough, it doesn't mean you'll get to your destination in time. So you need to have your driver take the shortest trip possible. By shortest, we're talking time. If a route A is X kilometers *longer*, but gets you there Y minutes *faster* than route B would, rather take that one.</p>\n\n<p>To know which route is the best one to take, we need to be able to predict how long the trip will last when taking a specific route. Therefore, *the goal of this playground competition is to predict the the duration of each trip in the test data set, given start and end coordinates.*</p><br>\n\n<h3>1.2 The Libraries & Functions</h3><br>\n<p>\nUsing Python 3.6.1, import the following libraries.

Data Preparation</h2>\n---------------------\n<p>My initial thoughts on this is that from the pickup_datetime field we should be extracting hour of day and day of week and day of month.  This seems logical since peak hour traffic and weekend vs non-weekend days could have a mayor effect on travel times. Similar to this there could be seasonality in the travel times to be observed between the different months of the year. Think, for example, of the effect New York's winter months might have on travel time. If the roads are wet/icy you're less likely to drive very fast, so regardless of which route you're taking, you'll take a bit longer to reach your destination.</p>\n\n<p>An interesting variable and its effects to potentially explore is the `passenger_count`. One might argue that an increased number of passengers could result in a few scenarios. It could, for example, result in increased stops along the way, which ultimately extends the time from A to B (note how we're not given the number of passengers at the start and end of the trip - my thinking is that if we were to know the start and end number of passengers in a trip, the data between drops would be split into separate entries, with the last entry in a collection of rows ending with 0 passengers). Also, from a purely physical point of view, the higher the number of passengers, the heavier the vehicle, the slower the vehicle might move. Although I'm fairly certain the effect of this is neglible. </p>\n\n<p>Same with `vendor` and `store_and_fwd_flag`. It is possible that looking into it, we find that there's a difference between vendor 1 and vendor 2, and that either one of the two might be corrupting the \"shortest route information\" because the vendor's employees are less efficient in finding the best routes through New York. This, however, I also find highly unlikely, but it is an alternative to explore (at least look into it and rule it out difinitively). As for `store_and_fwd_flag` - not having a connection to the server for a particular route to be indicative of a few things. For example, If upon inspection it is discovered that there is a strong correlation between slow trip times and server disconnects, it could be used as another feature in the training model to predict what time a particular route could take.</p>\n\n<p>Getting down to it however, the `_lattitude` and `_longitute` variables  is where I think the most value lies. The options here are to cluster them into \"neighborhoods\" as well as find the distance and directions between coordinates.</p>","metadata":{"_uuid":"633625a6c60625d49cbdd767bc612813dbc0d307","_cell_guid":"ce59bd56-3cc8-4572-b690-b80d58436e3b"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h3>2.1 Trip Duration Clean-up</h3><br>\n\n<p>As we noted earlier there are some outliers associated with the `trip_duration` variable, specifically a 980 hour maximum trip duration and a minimum of 1 second trip duration.

A couple of points stand out at first glance. Around late-Jan/early-Feb there is a massive drop in the number of trips taken. A slightly less drastic drop is apparent about four months later. The first drop could be related to the season: it's winter in New York so you'd expect less trips being taken (who wants to ride around when it's near freezing outside?). However, this seems unlikely because the dip looks to be isolated around a single day or couple of days. In my opinion there's a greater chance that there were strikes (if you've got the South African mindset I do, but this is New York, so probably not that) or that there was an issue with the data system recording the trips. Whatever the reason, it's worth noting these 'outliers'.</p>\n\n<p> Let's see how significantly (or not significantly at all) the two vendors differ in their respective mean trip durations:</p>","metadata":{"_uuid":"5a6efcd69dabd1c5c36a8a7e2b8a7836967f517f","_cell_guid":"bade31ca-7cde-4259-a4ed-0ef370607534"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\nplot_vendor = train.groupby('vendor_id')['trip_duration'].mean()\nplt.subplots(1,1,figsize=(17,10))\nplt.ylim(ymin=800)\nplt.ylim(ymax=840)\nsns.barplot(plot_vendor.index,plot_vendor.values)\nplt.title('Time per Vendor')\nplt.legend(loc=0)\nplt.ylabel('Time in Seconds')","metadata":{"_uuid":"4e6c43bb9fcf17d21dbe385d7c146275939b85b2","_cell_guid":"4af7af02-399b-4fa2-9fab-3dc7f750ce45","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-05T06:35:10.934969Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-05T06:35:10.935326Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-05T06:35:11.128615Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-05T06:35:10.935295Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-05T06:35:11.127509Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<p>So it doesn't look like there's much of a difference between travel times for the two vendors.

is exactly what we're expecting to see. The training set should have one more column than the test set, since it contains our target variable (which the test set doesn't). The next step is to split the training set into sub-training and sub-testing sets. The reason for this is to be able to tweak model parameters to increase accuracy (i.e. decrease the root mean square error [RSME] value) without creating bias towards the test set. Also, and perhaps more importantly, is that we need a validation set to use with XGBoost. So the XGBoost algorithm takes three datasets: a training set, a test set, and a validation set. The validation set is used to continuously evaluate the accuracy of the training model, and finally the model is used to make predictions against the test set. So splitting out the training set into a separate train and test set gives us a test sample of which we know the outcome variables. Makes sense, right?</p> <br>\n\n<p>For the sake of this tutorial we'll stick to 100 000 data points, this just makes the training process faster and a little less cumbersome to work with. Also, we'll split the training set into a 80-20 train and test set. So from this, there are two things you can do: change the ratios by which you split the original training set (`Train_Master`), e.g. use a 70-30 ratio and see what the results are. Also, you can include all the data points instead of just 100k.

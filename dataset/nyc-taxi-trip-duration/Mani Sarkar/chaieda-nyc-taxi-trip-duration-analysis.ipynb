## Summary\n>\n> - the dataset provided has very low missing values although observations provided cover only two vendors (two taxi companies) and also the data provided is across a single year and only six months of the year (fall data is missing)\n> - Analysis using location-based data features from the data-points:\n>   - **Manhattan** and **Queens** are the most popular pickup and dropoff districts\n>   - The most popular districts overshadow the rest of the districts by as many as 20x.\n>   - There is much less interaction between other districts using taxis. \n>   - Airport visits and returns are also much smaller in number compared to intra-city usage\n>   - **Upper West Side**, **Harlem** and **East Harlem** are the most popular pickup and dropoff neighbourhoods\n>   - The most popular neighbourhoods overshadow the rest of the neighbourhoods by as many as 10x\n>   - Some of the neighbourhoods are not visited as much as the top 10-20 neighbourhoods - maybe due to distance, cost of the journey, less or no work activity, unsafe to travel to\n> - Analysis using time-based data features from the data-points:\n>   - Apart for a 4-5 hours late at night into the wee-hours of the morning, taxis are in demand throughout the 24 hour period\n>   - If we observe closer, specifically speaking only during the evening times there is a drop in the demand for taxis, rest of the day and night times there is a continuous use of taxis in the city\n>   - There is rise/fall pattern of usage during the week, drops on **Saturday**, **Sunday**, and **Monday** and then gradually rises from **Tuesday** to **Friday** and back to the same cycle\n>   - From a monthly perspective (limited to six months only) - we can see a slow rise from **January** to **March** and then slow decline from **March** into **June**\n>   - No year-on-year analysis is possible as we have data limited to one year only i.e. 2016\n>   - From a seasonal point of view (limited to three seasons only, missing Fall data, we see a high usage in **Spring** and **Winter** and a relatively low usage during the **Summer**\n>   - **Weekdays** usage exceeds **Weekend** usage by a factor of 2x\n>   - And during Holidays and Festivals the usage is neglible as compared to a regular day usage, by a factor of say 20x\n> - **We can see how the taxis in a city like New York is so much location and time based and it's usage is more or less predictable on the basis of these factors (among others)**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a href='#ToC'><span class=\"label label-info\"

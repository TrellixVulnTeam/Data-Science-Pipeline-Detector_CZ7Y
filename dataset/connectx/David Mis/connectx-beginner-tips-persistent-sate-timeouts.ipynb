These are all things that tripped me up in the beginning.\n\n1. **Your agent functions don't have to be standalone.** You can write a python file with definitions at the top level as you normally would. Just make sure your agent function is the last definition in the file.\n\n\n2. **You can use global variables for persistent state.** This lets you store data across turns. For example, if you want to try Q-learning, you can save your value estimates and improve them as the game progresses.\n\n\n3. **Use `config.actTimeout` to get as much work done during your turn as possible.** You can also use config.timeout, which is the older name. They are the same (at least for now).\n\n\nAny additional tips are appreciated!\n\n\nThe rest of this notebook illustrates a simple agent that keeps track of its turn number to drop its pieces from left to right.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from kaggle_environments import make\n\nenv = make(\"connectx\", debug=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The next cell contains the code for our agent.

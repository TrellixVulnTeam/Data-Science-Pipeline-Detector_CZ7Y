In this environment the agent (playing white) is rewarded for capturing pieces (not for checkmate).  After running this notebook, you end up with an agent that can capture pieces against a random oponnent as demonstrated in the gif below. The main difference between this notebook and the previous one is that I use Q-networks as an alternative to Q-tables. Q-tables are nice and straightforward, but can only contain a limited amount of action values. Chess has state space complexity of 10<sup>47</sup>. Needless to say, this is too much information to put in a Q-table. This is where supervised learning comes in. A Q-network can represent a generalized mapping from state to action values.\n\n![](https://images.chesscomfiles.com/uploads/game-gifs/90px/green/neo/0/cc/0/0/aXFZUWpyN1Brc1BPbHQwS211WEhudkh6cXohMGFPMExPUTJNUTY4MDY1OTI1NFpSND8yOT85M1Y5MTA3MUxLQ3RDUkpDSjcwTE0wN293V0d6Rzc2cHhWTXJ6NlhzQVg0dUM0WGNNWDU,.gif)\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Import and Install"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport os\nimport inspect","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%load_ext autoreload\n%autoreload 2","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install python-chess  # Python-Chess is the Python Chess Package that handles the chess environment\n!pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/arjangroen/RLC.git  # RLC is the Reinforcement Learning package","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import chess\nfrom chess.pgn import Game\nimport RLC\nfrom RLC.capture_chess.environment import Board\nfrom RLC.capture_chess.learn import Q_learning\nfrom RLC.capture_chess.agent import Agent","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### The environment: Capture Chess\nIn this notebook we'll upgrade our environment to one that behaves more like real chess.

In this environment the agent (playing white) is rewarded for capturing pieces (not for checkmate).  After running this notebook, you end up with an agent that can capture pieces against a random oponnent as demonstrated in the gif below. The main difference between this notebook and the previous one is that I use Q-networks as an alternative to Q-tables. Q-tables are nice and straightforward, but can only contain a limited amount of action values. Chess has state space complexity of 10<sup>47</sup>. Needless to say, this is too much information to put in a Q-table. This is where supervised learning comes in. A Q-network can represent a generalized mapping from state to action values.\n\n![](https://images.chesscomfiles.com/uploads/game-gifs/90px/green/neo/0/cc/0/0/aXFZUWpyN1Brc1BPbHQwS211WEhudkh6cXohMGFPMExPUTJNUTY4MDY1OTI1NFpSND8yOT85M1Y5MTA3MUxLQ3RDUkpDSjcwTE0wN293V0d6Rzc2cHhWTXJ6NlhzQVg0dUM0WGNNWDU,.gif)\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Import and Install","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np #

We update our Q value in the direction of the discounted reward + the max successor state action value\n- I used prioritized experience replay to de-correlate the updates. If you want to now more about it, check the link in the references\n> - I used fixed-Q targets to stabilize the learning process. ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Implementation\n- I built two networks, A linear one and a convolutional one\n- The linear model maps the state (8,8,8) to the actions (64,64), resulting in over 32k trainable weights! This is highly inefficient because there is no parameter sharing, but it will work.\n- The convolutional model uses 2 1x1 convulutions and takes the outer product of the resulting arrays. This results in only 18 trainable weights! \n    - Advantage: More parameter sharing -> faster convergence\n    - Disadvantage: Information gets lost -> lower performance\n- For a real chess AI we need bigger neural networks. But now the neural network only has to learn to capture valuable pieces.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(inspect.getsource(R.play_game))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-29T09:19:25.569974Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-29T09:19:25.570216Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-29T09:19:25.636625Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-29T09:19:25.570188Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-29T09:19:25.63565Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Demo","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"pgn = R.learn(iters=750)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-29T09:19:25.639639Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-29T09:19:25.639894Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"reward_smooth = pd.DataFrame(R.reward_trace)\nreward_smooth.rolling(window=125,min_periods=0).mean().plot(figsize=(16,9),title='average performance over the last 125 steps')","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The PGN file is exported to the output folder.

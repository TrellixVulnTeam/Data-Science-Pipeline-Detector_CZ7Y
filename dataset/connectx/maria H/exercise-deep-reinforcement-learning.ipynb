How many nodes should you put in the output layer?\n\n- Option A: 2 nodes (number of game players)\n- Option B: 16 nodes (number of game pieces that each player starts with)\n- Option C: 4672 nodes (number of possible moves)\n- Option D: 64 nodes (number of squares on the game board)\n\nUse your answer to set the value of the `best_option` variable below.

You might like to:\n- change `PPO1` to `A2C` (or `ACER` or `ACKTR` or `TRPO`) when defining the model in this line of code: `model = PPO1(CustomCnnPolicy, vec_env, verbose=0)`.  This will let you see how performance can be affected by changing the algorithm from Proximal Policy Optimization [PPO] to one of:\n  - Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C),\n  - or Actor-Critic with Experience Replay (ACER),\n  - Actor Critic using Kronecker-factored Trust Region (ACKTR), or \n  - Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO).\n- modify the `change_reward()` method in the `ConnectFourGym` class to change the rewards that the agent receives in different conditions.  You may also need to modify `self.reward_range` in the `__init__` method (this tuple should always correspond to the minimum and maximum reward that the agent can receive).\n- change `agent2` to a different agent when creating the ConnectFour environment with `env = ConnectFourGym(agent2=\"random\")`.  For instance, you might like to use the `\"negamax\"` agent, or a different, custom agent.  Note that the smarter you make the opponent, the harder it will be for your agent to train!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Congratulations!\n\nYou have completed the course, and it's time to put your new skills to work!  \n\nThe next step is to apply what you've learned to a **[more complex game: Halite](https://www.kaggle.com/c/halite)**.

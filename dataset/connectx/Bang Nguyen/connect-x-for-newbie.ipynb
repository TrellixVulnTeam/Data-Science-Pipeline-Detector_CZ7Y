It returns an integer with the selected column, where indexing starts at zero. So, the returned value is one of 0-6, inclusive.\n\n\n**obs** contains two pieces of information:\n\n* obs.board - the game board (a Python list with one item for each grid location)\n* obs.mark - the piece assigned to the agent (either 1 or 2)\n\n\nobs.board is a Python list that shows the locations of the discs, where the first row appears first, followed by the second row, and so on. We use 1 to track player 1's discs, and 2 to track player 2's discs. \n\nFor instance, for a game board: obs.board can be [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 2, 0, 2, 0]\n\n\nconfig contains three pieces of information:\n\n* config.columns - number of columns in the game board (7 for Connect Four)\n* config.rows - number of rows in the game board (6 for Connect Four)\n\n\nconfig.inarow - number of pieces a player needs to get in a row in order to win (4 for Connect Four)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are three simple agents from https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/play-the-game","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Selects random valid column\ndef agent_random(obs, config):\n    #an agent function should be fully encapsulated (no external dependencies)\n    #then we need to import all librabries inside out agent\n    import random\n    valid_moves = [col for col in range(config.columns) if obs.board[col] == 0]\n    return random.choice(valid_moves)\n\n# Selects middle column\ndef agent_middle(obs, config):\n    return config.columns//2\n\n# Selects leftmost valid column\ndef agent_leftmost(obs, config):\n    valid_moves = [col for col in range(config.columns) if obs.board[col] == 0]\n    return valid_moves[0]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let agents play game against each other,we use the same env.run() method as before","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Agents play one game round\nenv.run([agent_random,agent_random])\n\n# Show the game\nenv.render(mode=\"ipython\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Evaluating agents\nThe outcome of a single game is usually not enough information to figure out how well our agents are likely to perform.

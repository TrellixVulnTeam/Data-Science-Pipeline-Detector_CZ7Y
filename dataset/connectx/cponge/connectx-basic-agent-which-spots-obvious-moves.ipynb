The Agent notes down which player you are and what the opponent is, as well as creates a board from the observation since it's easier to work with.  It then looks and sees which columns still have open space in them and notes them as the possible moves you can mak\n\nNow the logic begns.  The agent simulates dropping a tile into each space and sees if any would win you the game.  If so, it takes that move.\n\nIf there are no definite winning spaces, the agent checks if dropping an opponent tile into an available space would make them win the game.  If so, you go there instead blocking it.\n\nIf neither of those two methods give a definite best spot to go, it picks a space randomly.  However, This random decision is weighted towards the center being most likely, then the next rows out and so on with the edges being least likely.  This is based on the thought that the center spaces are \"Better\" since they can be involved in the most 4-in-a-rows."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"db2ae3a8-75ea-40c7-b4f3-e7ba92951ce2","_cell_guid":"d3a2ef70-bb2c-49c8-8d32-df8a7109dd22","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def myAgent(obs, config):    \n    # Which player is which?\n    myPlayer=obs.mark\n    otherPlayer=myPlayer % 2 + 1\n    board=makeBoard(obs)\n    moves=[c for c in range(config.columns) if obs.board[c]==0]\n\n    ##### Actual Agent Starts Here\n\n    # Find any definite winning Moves\n    for m in moves:\n        if checkWin(ifDropInCol(board,m,myPlayer))==myPlayer:\n            return m\n        \n    # Find any Defending Moves\n    for d in moves:\n        if checkWin(ifDropInCol(board,d,otherPlayer))==otherPlayer:\n            return d\n        \n    # Centerload Random Choices so Center is more likely\n    if 3 in moves:\n        for i in range(8):\n            moves.append(3) \n    if 2 in moves:\n        for i in range(4):\n            moves.append(2)\n    if 4 in moves:\n        for i in range(4):\n            moves.append(4)\n    if 1 in moves:\n        for i in range(2):\n            moves.append(1)\n    if 5 in moves:\n        for i in range(2):\n            moves.append(5)\n            \n    # Randomly return an available space from the list.\n    if len(moves)!=1:\n        return choice(moves)\n    \n    # If theres only 1 space available return it (choice errors out with fewer than 2 options)\n    else:\n        return moves[0]\n    \n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now we wanst to test this against Random and Negamax.

Tree/graph expansion follows a similar shape to A* search. \n\nThe algorithm starts with a root node with unexpanded children.\n\nExpansion happens in two parts. First is node selection, where is the tree is traversed from the root node, \nchoosing the child node with the highest UCB score, which includes an additional term to encourage exploration.\nWhen an unexpanded leaf node is reached, a random simulation of the game is run from that position \nwith the score and total counts backpropergated along the tree path.\n\nExpansions are repeatedly run until the timeout expires, and the child of root node with the highest score is chosen \nas the returned as the agent action.\n\n\n# Monty Carlo Heuristic Search\n\nLeaderboard Scores: \n- **1110 (top 4%)** | [MontyCarloHeuristic + BitboardGameoversHeuristic + Cached Data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/connectx/submissions?dialog=episodes-submission-16832763)\n- **1110 (top 4%)** | [MontyCarloHeuristic + BitboardGameoversHeuristic + Cached Data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/connectx/submissions?dialog=episodes-submission-16832763)\n- **1070 (top 6%)** | [MontyCarloHeuristic + BitboardGameoversHeuristic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/connectx/submissions?dialog=episodes-submission-16783457)\n\nSource:\n- [agents/MontyCarlo/MontyCarloPure.py](https://github.com/JamesMcGuigan/ai-games/tree/master/games/connectx/agents/MontyCarlo/MontyCarloPure.py)\n\nThis approach replaces random simulation (producing an integer score of 0|1) with a sigmoided version of \n`bitboard_gameovers_heuristic()` (producing a floating point score between 0 and 1). \n\nScaling the sigmoid by factor of 6 (division), produced the highest winrate compared to other numbers. \nThis means a heuristic value of +6 would return a sigmoid score of +0.73, which is pretty winning. \nSmaller differences in heuristic score would result in a value much closer to 0.5 draw. \nIf a terminal state in the game tree is reached, an integer score of 0|1 is returned.\n\nCompared to random simulation, a heuristic provides more indepth knowledge about a position, and it is significantly \nfaster to compute than running a full game simulation. This means many more expansions can be run within the same time limit.\n\n\n\n\n# Cached Data\n- [util/base64_file.py](https://github.com/JamesMcGuigan/ai-games/tree/master/games/connectx/util/base64_file.py)\n- [core/PersistentCacheAgent.py](https://github.com/JamesMcGuigan/ai-games/tree/master/games/connectx/core/PersistentCacheAgent.py)\n\nMuch of the MontyCarlo runtime is spent expanding the tree and computing simulations/heuristics. \nSome of this could be precomputed to extend the depth of search possible during the 8 second turn timer.\n\nThe state tree needed to be persisted to disk, in a pickle.zip.base64 format suitable for embedding as text \nin a python script, then reloaded upon initialization. \n\nSeveral hours of localhost runtime where spent playing the MontyCarlo agents against themselves and other agents\nincluding hundreds of matches against random_agent. This effectively generated an opening book and precached engdame \nvalues for some expected lines of play.  \n\nIn theory, kaggle allows 100Mb of submission data, but in practice data files larger than 5-10Mb \ncause kaggle submission errors. The original datafile generated by the above process was 47Mb which was too large.\nBy pruning the tree of any nodes that had not been fully expanded, the filesize was reduced to a workable 5Mb.   \n\nThis cached datafile significantly improved winrates on the leaderboard, both for Random Simulation \nand Heuristic versions of Monty Carlo Tree Search.\n\n\n\n# Bitsquares Heuristic \n\nLeaderboard Scores: \n- **(1120)** | [AlphaBetaBitboard + bitsquares_heuristic(reward_bitsquares=1.75)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/connectx/submissions?dialog=episodes-submission-16964089)\n- **(1120)** | [MontyCarloTreeSearch + bitsquares_heuristic(reward_bitsquares=1.75, sigmoid_width=6.0)](https://www.kaggle.com/c/connectx/submissions?dialog=episodes-submission-16964089)\n- **(1140)** | [MontyCarloTreeSearch + bitsquares_heuristic(reward_bitsquares=1.75, sigmoid_width=7.0) + 1.25MB precache](https://www.kaggle.com/c/connectx/submissions?dialog=episodes-submission-16964089)\n\n\n\nCode:\n- [heuristics/BitsquaresHeuristic.py](https://github.com/JamesMcGuigan/ai-games/tree/master/games/connectx/heuristics/BitsquaresHeuristic.py)\n \nThis takes a similar approach to Bitboard Gameovers Heuristic, in that it checks for every possible connect 4\nbitmask, containing only player owned or empty squares that is not blocked by opponent pieces.\n\nThe score is based counting the number of bits in each line and squaring the bitcount. \n\nHyperparameter tuning discovered that using a power of 1.75 rather than 2 improved the winrate against\n`bitboard_gameovers_heuristic()` from 48% to 94%, without using any `double_attack_score` logic.\n\nOptimal Reward Values given: **n ** 1.75**:\n- 1-in-a-row = 1 \n- 2-in-a-row = 3.4\n- 3-in-a-row = 6.8\n- 4-in-a-row = inf\n\n\nI have tried writing more advanced heuristics, taking into account the odd/even height of specific squares. These however have not performed quite as well in practice. \nThe main issue is the additional CPU performance cost of the heuristic, which is getting called in a tight loop. Investing more of out CPU budget into a heuristic score for each node, means that MCTS will be able to run less simulations and expand less nodes, thus allowing a cheap heuristic win against a better but more expensive heuristic. The bitsquares heuristic is much faster than simulating an entire game using random agent. \n- [heuristics/BitboardOddEvenHeuristic.py](https://github.com/JamesMcGuigan/ai-games/blob/master/games/connectx/heuristics/BitboardOddEvenHeuristic.py)\n\n\nA future ideas for research is to combine MCTS with a heuristic designed using a neural network trained through self-play. This mirrors the underlying design of AlphaZero.\nIn preperation for this I have attempted to implement the `is_gameover()` function in pytorch.\n- https://www.kaggle.com/jamesmcguigan/connectx-implementing-functions-in-pytorch/","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Buildchain\n\nSo here we can just fetch the commit from the github repo, and compile via kaggle_compile.py.\n- https://www.kaggle.com/jamesmcguigan/kaggle-compile-py-python-ide-to-kaggle-compiler\n\nNOTE: Kaggle notebooks only allow a maximum 1Mb of code in a notebook, so using precached base64 data cannot be simply be copy/pasted into a notebook, but must be generated via a runtime command.\n\nWe can take the existing saved data from the github repo, and make use of additional compute time on the Kaggle servers by rerunning the training script for additional runtime.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!apt-get install time dos2unix -y -qq  # NOTE: -qq requires using apt-get not apt","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-15T07:20:54.675287Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-15T07:20:54.675818Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-15T07:20:57.081379Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-15T07:20:54.675783Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-15T07:20:57.080199Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install fastcache","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-15T07:20:57.083812Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-15T07:20:57.084165Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-15T07:21:08.55367Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-15T07:20:57.084118Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-15T07:21:08.55265Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!rm -rf /ai-games/\n!git clone https://github.com/JamesMcGuigan/ai-games.git /ai-games/\n#!git checkout e275d53b40ce499ee670b0c1dd00bef17235affe\n!cd /ai-games/;

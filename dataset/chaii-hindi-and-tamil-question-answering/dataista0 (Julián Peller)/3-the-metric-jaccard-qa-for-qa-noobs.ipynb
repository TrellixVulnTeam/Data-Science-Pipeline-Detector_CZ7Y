The metric (`Jaccard`)\n### [chaii - Hindi and Tamil Question Answering](https://www.kaggle.com/c/chaii-hindi-and-tamil-question-answering) - A quick overview for QA noobs\n\nHi and welcome! This is the third kernel of the series `chaii - Hindi and Tamil Question Answering - A quick overview for QA noobs`.\n\n**In this short kernel we will go over the metric Jaccard**.\n\n\n---\n\nThe full series consists of the following notebooks:\n1. [The competition](https://www.kaggle.com/julian3833/1-the-competition-qa-for-qa-noobs)\n2. [The dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/julian3833/2-the-dataset-qa-for-qa-noobs)\n3. _[The metric (Jaccard)](https://www.kaggle.com/julian3833/3-the-metric-jaccard-qa-for-qa-noobs) (This notebook)_\n4. [Exploring Public Models](https://www.kaggle.com/julian3833/4-exploring-public-models-qa-for-qa-noobs/)\n5. [ðŸ¥‡ XLM-Roberta + Torch's extra data [LB: 0.749]](https://www.kaggle.com/julian3833/5-xlm-roberta-torch-s-extra-data-lb-0-749)\n6. [ðŸ¤— Pre & post processing](https://www.kaggle.com/julian3833/6-pre-post-processing-qa-for-qa-noobs/)\n\nThis is an ongoing project, so expect more notebooks to be added to the series soon. Actually, we are currently working on the following ones:\n* Exploring Public Models Revisited\n* Reviewing `squad2`, `mlqa` and others\n* About `xlm-roberta-large-squad2`\n* Own improvements\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n# Evaluation\n\nThis is copied literally from the [evaluation](https://www.kaggle.com/c/chaii-hindi-and-tamil-question-answering/overview/evaluation) tab of the competition:\n\n>The metric in this competition is the [word-level Jaccard score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index). A good description of Jaccard similarity for strings is [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/overview-of-text-similarity-metrics-3397c4601f50). \n\n> A Python implementation based on the links above, and matched with the output of the C# implementation on the back end, is provided below.\n\n```python\ndef jaccard(str1, str2): \n    a = set(str1.lower().split()) \n    b = set(str2.lower().split())\n    c = a.intersection(b)\n    return float(len(c)) / (len(a) + len(b) - len(c))\n```\n\n\n# Jaccard for sets\n\n\nBefore applying the measure to texts, let's use it for sets of elements.\n\nThe jaccard coefficient measures **the intersection over the union** of two sets:\n\n$$\nJ(A,B) = {{|A \\cap B|}\\over{|A \\cup B|}}\n$$\n \nSo, for example, consider the sets `a={1, 2}` and `b={2}` it's jaccard coefficient is `0.5`, because the intersection of both is `{2}` and has lenght `1` while the union is `{1, 2}` and has lenght `2`, leading to the division `1/2` (intersection length / union length).\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def jaccard(a, b): \n    intersection = a.intersection(b)\n    union = a.union(b)\n    jaccard = len(intersection) / len(union)\n    return float(jaccard)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-14T02:53:02.975842Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-14T02:53:02.976168Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-14T02:53:02.980601Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-14T02:53:02.976141Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-14T02:53:02.979943Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"jaccard({1, 2}, {2})","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-14T02:53:03.409806Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-14T02:53:03.410334Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-14T02:53:03.415994Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-14T02:53:03.410297Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-14T02:53:03.414763Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"jaccard({1, 2, 3}, {2})","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-14T02:53:13.099558Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-14T02:53:13.09991Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-14T02:53:13.106493Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-14T02:53:13.09988Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-14T02:53:13.10564Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"jaccard({1, 2, 3}, {3, 4})","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-14T02:53:40.253845Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-14T02:53:40.254183Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-14T02:53:40.261452Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-14T02:53:40.254151Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-14T02:53:40.260282Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Jaccard is a measure of similarity considering the overlap of elements.

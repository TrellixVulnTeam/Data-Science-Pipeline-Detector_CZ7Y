Consider, for example, MNIST and digit recognition. For a sample showing a `3`, the actual answer would be encoded as `y_true = [0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]` (where there is a 1 in the forth position, corresponding to 3 starting from zero), while a prediction would be probability distribution over the 10 possible values: `y_proba = [0.01, 0.0, 0.05, 0.44, 0.15, 0.0, 0.05, 0.02, 0.25, 0.03]`\n\nIn the case of the `start_position`, instead of 10 possible digits, when have `n` possible tokens, and only one of them is the actual starting-position token (the one which will have the `1` in the `y_true`). \nThe model then generates a distribution over all the tokens, and with cross entropy we get a loss, that will help the model to learn in the subsequent iterations.\n\nThe same happens for the `end_position` and in the last line, the final reported loss is just the average of both losses. \n\nA little caveat: the softmax layer is not applied, so there is no probability distribution but logits, which can be translated to probabilities easily and provide a ranking or a score for the possible answers (the highest logit will map to the highest probability and so on).\n\nAll in all, the conclusion of this section is the following:\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: center; background-color:#C8FF33;padding:40px;border-radius: 30px;\">\n    Question Answering is modeled as a double classification problem.\n</h2>\n\n\nNow let's

this already on the table, we can discuss what the next two functions do.\nThey handle three different problems, each of them very simple in its nature:\n\n\n**1. Map from two logits to a string**\n\nFirst of all, the answers are built with a `start_position` and an `end_position`. The answer with the highest probability, and therefore the one the model would return with a simple unique solution, starts with \nthe token `a` and ends with the token `1945`: `a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945`.\n\nWe need to implement this, tough â€”all the way from the 2 logits to the string.\n\n**2. Get a _valid_ answer**\n\nOn the other hand, the start and end logits returned as the first answer might be invalid. For example, the end position might be pointing to a token that is before the one pointed by the start position. Or they might be pointing to the question section of the input and not to the context.\n\nThese are two consistency checks:\n1. Start position is before end position\n2. Both positions point to the context and not somewhere else\n\n\nSo a more thoughtful approach to obtaining the answer would be to get a set of the most probable ones and keep the best scored valid one.\n\n\n**3. Rollback context splitting**\n\nFinally, we have to rollback the splitting done to the context that we extensively covered in the previous section.\n\n\nWith these three tasks on the top of our head, we can jump into the two remaining functions:\n\n\n\n# prepare_validation_features()\n\n`prepare_validation_features` does three things:\n1. It tokenizes, exactly as in the train case\n2. It adds an \"example_id\" key to each tokenized example, with a reference to the original sentence the sample belonged to, before the context splitting.\n3. It modifies the key \"offset_mapping\" of each tokenized example, to make it easy to map from the logits to the string later on (in `postprocess_qa_predictions`)\n\nThe actual code is hidden in the cell below, and it has 45 lines of code.\nBelow, visible, you will find a modified version, with the same exact functionality, using two auxiliary functions. \n\nThe `tokenize` function, which is exactly the same as the one used for the `prepare_training_features` and a new one, defined below, `add_example_id_and_modify_offset_mapping`.

It involved the vast majority of the world's countriesâ€”including all of the great powersâ€”forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis powers. In a total war directly involving more than 100 million personnel from more than 30 countries, the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, blurring the distinction between civilian and military resources. Aircraft played a major role in the conflict, enabling the strategic bombing of population centres and the only two uses of nuclear weapons in war to this day. World War II was by far the deadliest conflict in human history; it resulted in 70 to 85 million fatalities, a majority being civilians. Tens of millions of people died due to genocides (including the Holocaust), starvation, massacres, and disease. In the wake of the Axis defeat, Germany and Japan were occupied, and war crimes tribunals were conducted against German and Japanese leaders.\nWorld War II is generally considered to have begun on 1 September 1939, when Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, invaded Poland. The United Kingdom and France subsequently declared war on Germany on the 3rd of September. Under the Molotovâ€“Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union had partitioned Poland and marked out their \"spheres of influence\" across Finland, Romania and the Baltic states. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and treaties, Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe, and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan (along with other countries later on). Following the onset of campaigns in North Africa and East Africa, and the fall of France in mid-1940, the war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the British Empire, with war in the Balkans, the aerial Battle of Britain, the Blitz of the UK, and the Battle of the Atlantic. On 22 June 1941, Germany led the European Axis powers in an invasion of the Soviet Union, opening the Eastern Front, the largest land theatre of war in history and trapping the Axis powers, crucially the German Wehrmacht, in a war of attrition.\"\"\"","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-06T14:40:41.827631Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-06T14:40:41.82822Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-06T14:40:41.833382Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-06T14:40:41.828181Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-06T14:40:41.832537Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2465921/how-to-copy-a-dictionary-and-only-edit-the-copy\nlarge_examples = dict(examples) # Copy losing the reference to the original\nlarge_examples","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-06T14:40:41.834697Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-06T14:40:41.835349Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-06T14:40:41.845436Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-06T14:40:41.835311Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-06T14:40:41.84445Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"large_examples['question'].append(\"When did the WW2 begin?\")\nlarge_examples['context'].append(large_ctx)\nlarge_examples['answers'].append({'answer_start': [large_ctx.find(\"1 September\")], 'text': ['1 September 1939']})\nlarge_examples['id'].append('ww2-q2')\nlarge_examples","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-06T14:40:41.846764Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-06T14:40:41.847236Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-06T14:40:41.85581Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-06T14:40:41.847198Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-06T14:40:41.854857Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"tokenized_validation_large_examples = prepare_validation_features(large_examples)\n# The second example generated 2 features\nlen(tokenized_validation_large_examples['input_ids'])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-06T14:40:41.856952Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-06T14:40:41.857551Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-06T14:40:41.871304Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-06T14:40:41.857516Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-06T14:40:41.870351Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# The second and third features reference ww2-q2 as their originating example\ntokenized_validation_large_examples['example_id']","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-06T14:40:41.872465Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-06T14:40:41.873049Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-06T14:40:41.878642Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-06T14:40:41.873015Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-06T14:40:41.877739Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# postprocess_qa_predictions()\n\nOk, now that we have `prepare_validation_features()`, we can dig into the last function: `postprocess_qa_predictions()`\n\nThe actual code is hidden in the next code cell.

","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Wrapping up\n\nTo sum up, let's go through a high-level description of the functionality each of the three functions implements:\n\n### prepare_train_features()\nThis function turns the original train examples into train features, tokenizing them and taking care of large contexts when they appear, generating more than one \"train feature\" (tokenized train example).\nIt also takes care of massaging the squad-like target (`answer_start` pointing to a char and `answer_text`) into the model-friendly ones `start_position` and `end_position`, pointing to tokens in the feature.\n\n### prepare_validation_features()\nThis function tokenizes the input and takes care of large contexts mimiking the previous one. It adds a back-reference from features to their originating examples (`example_id`) and massages the `offset_mapping` to help `postprocess_qa_predictions()` down the path.\n\n### postprocess_qa_predictions()\nThis function gets one unique answer for an original example, starting with the model predictions for all the generated features for that example. It performs various steps for this:\n1. It gets a list of ranked valid answers from the predicted logits for each given feature performing various consistency checks of the pair (start, end). \n2. It translates from tokens to chars, extracting the final string answer.\n3. It takes care of going back from the features to the original example.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n# References\n* [ðŸ¤— QA fine-tuning example reference](https://github.com/huggingface/notebooks/blob/master/examples/question_answering.ipynb)\n* [Question Answering Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/thedrcat/question-answering-tutorial) by thedrcat.\n* [ðŸ¤— Preprocessing tutorial](https://huggingface.co/transformers/preprocessing.html)\n* [The tokenization pipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/python/latest/pipeline.html#the-tokenization-pipeline)\n* [HuggingFace course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1)\n\n\n\n## What's next?\n\nStay tuned, I'm working on the next 2 notebooks of the series: `Exploring Public Models Revisited` and `Reviewing squad2, mlqa and others`\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n\n## Remember to upvote the notebook if you found it useful! ðŸ¤—\n\n","metadata":{}}]}

Transformers have been revolutionary models that yield state-of-art variants like BERT, GPT, mt5, T5, tapas, Albert, Robert, and many more from their families. The Hugging face library has provided excellent documentation with the implementation of various real-world scenarios.\nHere, we’ll try to implement the Roberta model for the question answering system. Rather than directly diving into our code, we’ll revise some theoretical concepts that are mandatory to understand the code. Believe me, it takes a slightly longer span for a newcomer into Natural language processing to understand the logic behind the code. I tried my best in explaining it conceptually. It’s also the duty of the reader to try understanding the code by going through it simultaneously until you don’t get it, and browsing stuff that you aren’t able to know within this article will definitely work for you.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Terms you should be familiar of\n\n* Tokens: Tokens are the building blocks of natural language processing. The tokens are created after the tokenization of text. Tokenization can mainly be categorized into word, character, and subword, i.e. the n-gram characters tokenization.\n\n* input_ids: input_ids are token indices; they are the numerical representations of tokens; a list of these representations is called sequences used as input by the model.\n\n* sequence_ids: Sequence_ids tell us which part in the sequence is the question and which of these is the answer. The unique tokens are encoded as None, where 0’s are questions, and 1’s are context.\n\n* offset_mapping: offset_mapping parameter provides us with the token’s position, which is a tuple of the start and end index of the tokens that makes it easy to find their original position.\n\n* overflow_sampling: Like how the examples, i.e. the context, are truncated due to the max_length limit, so the trimmed part is continued in the following sequence with a confident stride rate, the overflowing sample is the map of how many splits is the context fitted. Like in the below image, the 0’s are the first context in the dataset, which was big enough and hence is held in lots of splits.\n\n* max_length: The constant length defined for the sequence to be processed and fed to the model.\n\n* Padding: padding satisfies the sequence with the given max_length like if the max_length is 20 and our text has only 15 words, so after tokenizing it, the text will get padded with 1’s to get the sequence length of 20. The padding can be done from the front as well as the end of the sequence.\n\n* Stride: Stride is the rate with how much token length the truncated sequence should be patched with the next one. It is basically used to handle the overflow.\n\n* Truncation: cutting the sequence after the max_length is reached.\n\n* start_token/end__token: The starting token of a specific observation needs to be fetched, for example, the start token of answers in the context, and the similar is the end token which is the ending token of that answer.\n\n* attention_mask: Attention masks tell the attention mechanism in the model to exclude the paddings that aren’t the actual tokens. It makes us easy to distinguish between the actual tokens and the padding in the combined sequence.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## ROBERTA Tokenization style\nRoberta uses the byte-level Byte-Pair-Encoding method derived from GPT-2. The vocabulary consists of 50000-word pieces. \\U0120 as the unique character is used in the byte pair encoding, which hasn’t been made visible to us by hugging face. BPE is like a data compression algorithm in which the most common pair of consecutive bytes of data is replaced with a byte that does not occur in that Data.\nConsider data ggghgghggh during encoding this Data. The byte pair gg occurs most often, so we will replace it with K. The rare words are broken down into more subword tokens.

Firstly, the whitespace will be removed, which is present on the left of some questions in train data. Next is one of the extensive steps which is used in every transformer model, the tokenizer. The tokenizer tokenizes sentences into chunks, as shown below.\n\n    <s> sequence_1 </s></s> sequence_2 </s> \n\nWhere <s> is the classifier token and </s> is the separator token. We pass the question and context to the tokenizer, checking whether the tokenizer padding position is on the right or left, but it is to the left by default. So the tokenizer will tokenize the sequences along with padding the sequences with max_length to satisfy the given sequence limit. We have added a truncation parameter to the tokenizer that truncates the sequence after the max_length limit. The stride specifies that by what length of tokens the sequence should overlap with the previous overflowed sequence. While truncating sequences, we may lose a lot of data which isn’t a good practice in terms of data science. To overcome this problem, we need to return the overflowed sequences to forward them to further sequence to get overlapped with them. We also return the offset mappings, which gives us the map of the positions of the tokens.\nIn the next step, we extract the sample mapping that counts the split of a pair it has made. As we know the offset_mapping gives us the positional information of the sequences. Lastly, we start collecting the start and end tokens with some logic applied in the loop. We extract the sequence_ids, which helps us to distinguish between the question and context. The cls_index is the classifier token index. The function above processes a single sample at a time. In the case where the answer does not exist in the context, we place the start and end positions. The sample_index is the index of the example containing this span of text, i.e. the sample mapping index. Finally, we’ll collect the start and end index of the specific instance in the loop; if the answer is not in the example, we’ll label it with the CLS token; otherwise, we’ll move the start and end index to the starting ending points of the answers. The function returns the list of preprocessed examples.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def convert_answers(r):\n    start = r[0]\n    text = r[1]\n    return {\n        'answer_start': [start],\n        'text': [text]\n    }\n\ntrain = train.sample(frac=1, random_state=42)\ntrain['answers'] = train[['answer_start', 'answer_text']].apply(convert_answers, axis=1)\n\ndf_train = train[:-64].reset_index(drop=True)\ndf_valid = train[-64:].reset_index(drop=True)\n\ntrain_dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(df_train)\nvalid_dataset = Dataset.from_pandas(df_valid)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-22T15:31:58.708468Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-22T15:31:58.709109Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-22T15:31:58.887807Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-22T15:31:58.709062Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-22T15:31:58.886705Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_dataset[0]","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-22T15:31:58.891674Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-22T15:31:58.891964Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-22T15:31:58.907137Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-22T15:31:58.891932Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-22T15:31:58.905812Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Before passing the train data to the feature preparation function, we need to create a dimension named answers consisting of answer_start and answer_text; further, we generate a random sample of the data and represent the Dataset object from a pandas DataFrame.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"tokenized_train_ds = train_dataset.map(prepare_train_features, batched=True, remove_columns=train_dataset.column_names)\ntokenized_valid_ds = valid_dataset.map(prepare_train_features, batched=True, remove_columns=train_dataset.column_names)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-22T15:31:58.913041Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-22T15:31:58.913341Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-22T15:33:02.538059Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-22T15:31:58.91331Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-22T15:33:02.53707Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The above code will be used to preprocess the train and test data by applying the prepare_train_feature function to it.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%env WANDB_DISABLED=True\nargs = TrainingArguments(\n    f\"chaii-qa\",\n    evaluation_strategy = \"epoch\",\n    save_strategy = \"epoch\",\n    learning_rate=3e-5,\n    warmup_ratio=0.1,\n    gradient_accumulation_steps=8,\n    per_device_train_batch_size=batch_size,\n    per_device_eval_batch_size=batch_size,\n    num_train_epochs=1,\n    weight_decay=0.01,\n)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-22T15:33:02.539502Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-22T15:33:02.540332Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-22T15:33:02.622352Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-22T15:33:02.540264Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-22T15:33:02.621372Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Configure the training parameters.

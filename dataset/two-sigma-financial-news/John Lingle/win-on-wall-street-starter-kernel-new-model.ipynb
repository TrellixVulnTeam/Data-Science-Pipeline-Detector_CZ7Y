You will loop through a long series of trading days; for each day, you'll receive an updated state of the market, and a series of news articles which were published since the last trading day, along with impacted stocks and sentiment analysis.  You'll use this information to predict whether each stock will have increased or decreased ten trading days into the future.  Once you make these predictions, you can move on to the next trading day. \n\nThis competition is different from most Kaggle Competitions in that:\n* You can only submit from Kaggle Kernels, and you may not use other data sources, GPU, or internet access.\n* This is a **two-stage competition**.  In Stage One you can edit your Kernels and improve your model, where Public Leaderboard scores are based on their predictions relative to past market data.  At the beginning of Stage Two, your Kernels are locked, and we will re-run your Kernels over the next six months, scoring them based on their predictions relative to live data as those six months unfold.\n* You must use our custom **`kaggle.competitions.twosigmanews`** Python module.  The purpose of this module is to control the flow of information to ensure that you are not using future data to make predictions for the current trading day.\n\n## In this Starter Kernel, we'll show how to use the **`twosigmanews`** module to get the training data, get test features and make predictions, and write the submission file.\n## TL;DR: End-to-End Usage Example\n```\nfrom kaggle.competitions import twosigmanews\nenv = twosigmanews.make_env()\n\n(market_train_df, news_train_df) = env.get_training_data()\ntrain_my_model(market_train_df, news_train_df)\n\nfor (market_obs_df, news_obs_df, predictions_template_df) in env.get_prediction_days():\n  predictions_df = make_my_predictions(market_obs_df, news_obs_df, predictions_template_df)\n  env.predict(predictions_df)\n  \nenv.write_submission_file()\n```\nNote that `train_my_model` and `make_my_predictions` are functions you need to write for the above example to work."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"225708f447eee93041881f9d6c3a3e890cb16718"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## <a id=\"0\">Contents  \n### [1.

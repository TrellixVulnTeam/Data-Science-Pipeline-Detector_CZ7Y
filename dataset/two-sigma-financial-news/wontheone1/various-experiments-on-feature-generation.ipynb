Unfortunately, I didn't know how to create features quickly so I could not use many features in the end because the more feature I have, the more it will take to create them. Vadim kindly shared a [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/nareyko/fast-lags-calculation-concept-using-numpy-arrays/comments#454588) that shows how to create features very fast. Using this code, it is possible to make use of many features. So, I wanted to experiment with a lot of features that might be useful.\nCredits for efficient feature creation algorithms goes to [Vadim](https://www.kaggle.com/nareyko). Other kernels that inspired me for ideas include [simple quant features kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/youhanlee/simple-quant-features-using-python), [eda kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/qqgeogor/eda-script-67) and [another eda with nice visualization](https://www.kaggle.com/artgor/eda-feature-engineering-and-everything)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"5363c3301fe77aeac413f57975e1759c5a6ae125","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from kaggle.competitions import twosigmanews\nimport catboost as catb\nfrom catboost import CatBoostClassifier\nfrom datetime import datetime, date\nimport gc\nimport lightgbm as lgb\nimport multiprocessing\nfrom multiprocessing import Pool\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom resource import getrusage, RUSAGE_SELF\nfrom sklearn import model_selection\nfrom xgboost import XGBClassifier","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"d1bb730c79750a444af6e886ef9b9e4a57dbda5a","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"np.random.seed(1) # I don't know if using numpy random seeding helps in reproducing results but I do it anyways to be safe","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"0639c1a822cb6d9e7b5d77785aa4c9d59db2c643","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"global STARTED_TIME\nSTARTED_TIME = datetime.now()\n\n# It's better to use cpu_count from the system - who knows what happens during test phase\nglobal N_THREADS\nN_THREADS = multiprocessing.cpu_count() * 2 \n\nprint(f'N_THREADS: {N_THREADS}')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"a05248e0835b4a2d4d5ce8dafda31b757028330d","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# FILTERDATE - start date for the train data\nFILTERDATE = date(2007, 1, 1)\n\n# SAMPLEDATE - use it for sampling and fast sanity check of scripts.

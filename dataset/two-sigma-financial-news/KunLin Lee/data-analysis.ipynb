All of the returns in this set of marketdata have these properties:\n\n* Returns are always calculated either open-to-open (from the opening time of one trading day to the open of another) or close-to-close (from the closing time of one trading day to the open of another).\n\n* Returns are either raw, meaning that the data is not adjusted against any benchmark, or market-residualized (Mktres), meaning that the movement of the market as a whole has been accounted for, leaving only movements inherent to the instrument.\n\n* Returns can be calculated over any arbitrary interval. Provided here are 1 day and 10 day horizons.\n* Returns are tagged with 'Prev' if they are backwards looking in time, or 'Next' if forwards looking.\n\n| ï»¿   \t| column                            \t| desc                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \t|\n|----\t|-----------------------------------\t|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\t|\n| 1  \t| time(datetime64[ns, UTC])         \t| the current time (in marketdata, all rows are taken at 22:00 UTC)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \t|\n| 2  \t| assetCode(object)                 \t| a unique id of an asset                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \t|\n| 3  \t| assetName(category)               \t| the name that corresponds to a group of assetCodes.

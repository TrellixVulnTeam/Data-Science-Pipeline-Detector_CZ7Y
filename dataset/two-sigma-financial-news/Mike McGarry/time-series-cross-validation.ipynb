It can be very frustrating when you think you have a great model but when you submit it for scoring it fails. Furthermore it is very annoying when you get a great result on a model but can't understand why.\n\nThis is especially import for us in this competition as we are dealing with time series data. Without a stable cross validation we will end up overfitting the public leaderboard. When it comes time to test our model on the private leaderboard it is likely to fall apart.\n\nFor this reason we will use Purged Time Series K-Fold Cross Validation to build a stable cross validation framework for evaluationg our model.\n\nLet's break that down quickly:\n\nTime Series - We are working with time series data and will thus split our training and validation sets based on a time window, in this case we will use year-months e.g. February 2008, March 2009 etc.\nPurged - Means that we will ensure there is a gap between our training and validation sets so that there is no data leakage"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"75e9a85615d63773fe8bf44de9ac83a6bb913ba5"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Import Libraries**"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nfrom kaggle.competitions import twosigmanews #TwoSigmaAPI\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier\nfrom sklearn.base import clone\n\nimport random\nimport math\nfrom datetime import timedelta","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"fb25ba62b30a0691b9216a6984d1184ae2c05184"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Get our data**"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Crete our environment\nenv = twosigmanews.make_env()\n(market_label_df, news_label_df) = env.get_training_data()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"85e966504b821ffe29b52e29a151849709d75924"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Function A) Create our K-Folds by splitting the data on year-months**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"1583b7dc9a56278aab20d28a515b0f2120f5c838"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def kFoldIndices(df, folds):\n    \"\"\"\n    This function creates a list of training and validation indices for our K-Folds based on splitting the data on year-months\n    \"\"\"\n    #Get a set of all the available year months\n    df.loc[:, 'yearmonth'] = df.loc[:, 'time'].dt.strftime('%Y-%m')\n    yearmonths = set(df['yearmonth'].unique())\n    #Work out the fold size from the total number of folds available and the number of folds we want to use\n    #tk -

However, for those who want have a qiuck overview in datasets statistics and jump right into preprocessing and bulding model I decided to create this notebook. So sa you can see, with few lines of code we could have a broad overview of our dataset. In this notebook I have used two technics to get similar results. I aslo had to limited the output of the report when I was using pandas_profiling as the data was to big to create a full report nut with some smaller ones you could have nice output with lots more information about any dataset.

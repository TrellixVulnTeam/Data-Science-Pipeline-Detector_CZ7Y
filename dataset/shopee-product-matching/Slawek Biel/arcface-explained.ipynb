Normalize the embeddings and weights\n2. Calculate the dot products\n3. Calculate the angles with arccos\n4. **Add a constant factor m to the angle corresponding to the ground truth label**\n5. Turn angles back to cosines\n6. Use cross entropy on the new cosine values to calculate loss\n\nThe only part left to explain is the step 4. What we are doing is making it harder for the network to train. Similar to what dropout or weight decay does, but here we are extra mean and only shift the activation the network want's to predict. The idea is that in order for the activation to win at softmax it not only needs to be slightly better than the second best. It needs to be better by more than the angle we shifted by adding **m** (the default 0.4 corresponds to about 20 degrees). We add a margin to one of the angles, hence the 'Additive Angular Margin\nLoss' in the title of the paper.\n\nThe intended consequence of that is that we force embeddings to cluster closer together within class and further apart across other classes.\n\n*Side note: there is another step in the paper that scales all the vectors by a constant factor at the end. This doesn't change the ordering of logits but changes their relative values after softmax. I didn't see it help on this dataset but it might be a hyperparameter worth tweaking on other tasks.*"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Sample Implementation ##"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"class ArcFaceClassifier(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, emb_size, output_classes):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.W = nn.Parameter(torch.Tensor(emb_size, output_classes))\n        nn.init.kaiming_uniform_(self.W)\n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Step 1:\n        x_norm = F.normalize(x)\n        W_norm = F.normalize(self.W, dim=0)\n        # Step 2:\n        return x_norm @ W_norm\n    \ndef arcface_loss(cosine, targ, m=.4):\n    # this prevents nan when a value slightly crosses 1.0 due to numerical error\n    cosine = cosine.clip(-1+1e-7, 1-1e-7) \n    # Step 3:\n    arcosine = cosine.arccos()\n    # Step 4:\n    arcosine += F.one_hot(targ, num_classes = output_classes) * m\n    # Step 5:\n    cosine2 = arcosine.cos()\n    # Step 6:\n    return F.cross_entropy(cosine2, targ)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Test it on MNIST, using fastai for training"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### The model:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# a very basic network, just four strided convolutions, batch norm and ReLu\nclass SimpleConv(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, classifier):\n        super().__init__()\n        ch_in=[3,6,12,24]\n        convs = [ConvLayer(c, c*2, stride=2) for c in ch_in]\n        convs += [AdaptiveAvgPool(), Flatten(), nn.Linear(48, emb_size)]\n        self.convs = nn.Sequential(*convs)\n        self.classifier = classifier\n        \n    def get_embs(self, x):\n        return self.convs(x)\n    \n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.get_embs(x)\n        x = self.classifier(x)\n        return x\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"jupyter":{"source_hidden":true},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# helper method to extract all embedings from a data loader\ndef get_embs(model, dl):\n    embs = []\n    ys = []\n    for bx,by in tqdm(dl):\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            embs.append(model.get_embs(bx))\n            ys.append(by)\n    embs = torch.cat(embs)\n    embs = embs / embs.norm(p=2,dim=1)[:,None]\n    ys = torch.cat(ys)\n    return embs,ys\n\n# helper to plot embeddings in 3D\ndef plot_embs(embs, ys, ax):\n    #ax.axis('off')\n    for k in range(10):\n        e = embs[ys==k].cpu()\n        ax.scatter(e[:,0], e[:,1], e[:,2], s=4, alpha=.2)   \n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* Three lines of code to create a dataloader and train our model.

{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It often helps to think from a contrarian point of view. This could open up unexpected avenues of pursuit. So in the current competition, while the focus is on **MATCHING** products, we can try taking a step back to see conditions when products can be **UN-MATCHED**. \n\n* The first criteria for ‘un-matching’ could be the **PRICE**. If the price is not within an acceptable range, we probably know that the products are different. We can’t have a Rp@6999 product compare with a Rp@999 product though the rest of the text title and the images may be quite similar. A quick check at the training data shows that the price info seems to have been scrubbed for most of the records barring very few.\n\n* The second could be the **ORG NAME**. We just can’t have a Sony 32 inch TV HD color hi pixel whatsoever match with a Samsung 32 inch TV HD color hi pixel whatsoever. This could be a criteria for un-matching in current dataset. However a bulk of the items listed are small ones and don’t have a tangible org name associated. So success could be limited. Nonetheless this could work to some extent.\n\n* We could have a whole range of ‘**CONTRASTS**’ lookup tables. We could have sex as one of the entry. An xxx perfume strong cologne fragrance for males could be different than an exactly similar (text, image) product but one designed for females. We could have color contrasts. White Apple iPhone 10 256 GB versus Black Apple iPhone 10 256 GB.  There could be several such interesting rows of contrasting criteria. A look-up table could hold these contrasting pairs and then we could ensure that they are not present individually in the two product titles being compared\n\n* Then based on the product **CATEGORY** (yes we may have to do some topic labelling as train data does not have this) we could have some strong category specific differentiators. For e.g. for edibles, we could have ‘organic’ versus ’natural’ versus ‘non-organic’ or just the absence of the word ‘organic’. So 100% grape juice Tropicana sweet real grapes should be different from 100% organic grape juice Tropicana sweet real grapes. Last I checked the train data had about 250 organic products, so this could help to some extent. Based on the product category, other interesting contrasts can be identified and used to un-match products.\n\n* We could also have **APHANUMERIC CODES**. For e.g. org1 LR220X-5A lighting lamp manita may not be equal to org1 LR220Y-5A lighting lamp manita. Or to cover a more simpler case anti-wrinkle anti-uv cream SPF-250 is different from anti-wrinkle anti-uv cream SPF-50.\n\n* Lastly we have the **QUANTITY**. This could be a very important indicator for un-matching. For sure - “L’Oreal Paris Total Repair 5 Shampoo Hair Care - 450 ml (Perawatan Rambut Rusak dan Mudah Patah)” is different from “\\L’Oreal Paris Total Repair 5 Shampoo Hair Care - 900 ml (Perawatan Rambut Rusak dan Mudah Patah)” even though the rest of the text and the entire image may nearly be the same. \n\nLet us see if we can leverage existing frameworks to quickly give out this kind of info"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pd.set_option('display.max_colwidth', None)\n\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/shopee-product-matching/train.csv')\ntrain['titleUcase'] = train['title'].str.upper()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let us use Spacy.

More noise. \n\nSo a 100% success of our un-match logic as far as these 10 records are concerned. If so our CV should have scored much much better. If we go all the way and do it for entire train data we get **1684 yays and 516 gosh's**. So there is a fair bit of correct post-processing, so need to investigate why CV is not going up further. Maybe this weekend I will do that. Also our code is pretty basic and we havent taken care of any edge conditions or looked at improving speed/elegance etc. Defintiely, many things can be improved.\n\nThis idea (& a few others - in particular generating more training records from this limited data - esp for products with low samples) has been on the back of my mind for a while now but work constraints didnt allow me to put pen to paper (or pressure to the keyboard keys until now). I could see some discussions related to this as well. I believe it was Chris who referred to the importance of numerical values in one of the discussions couple of weeks back followed by another recent discussion by Sarthak. In fact un-matching is an entire post-processing piece by itself and covers lot more than prices or numericals (see my discussion link on this). The results seem promising with slight improvement in CV and ideally the test scores too should improve with PP. I dont have time to submit or participate in this comp but if anyone gets a better test score, please do share the results and your observations\n\nAlso this PP exposes the noisiness of the train data. There are pairs that should have not been matched under label group but have been matched. I hope the test data is much cleaner. \n\nHow else can un-matching be leveraged? Well this is a time-constrained comp so if we are comparing a row against every other row in the test DB, it could consume vast amounts of time. The ‘un-matching’ criteria could be used to generate clusters beyond which matching may not be required and this should reduce time taken which be used for other activities. \n\nAll said and done, even if it does not matter to the comp scores, this seems to me to be the right way to approach the business problem. This is one of those domains where the model needs to be confident on its predictions. If it is not very confident, it is ok not to predict (and leave it to be manually hand-labelled as similar or dissimilar). Special efforts need to be taken to eliminate the false positives and hence the un-matching logic could hold the key to actual applications of this tech. In fact it is interesting that we get a few rows in train data which are pretty obviously mis-grouped. The usage of un-matching could have prevented that easily. \n\nShoppe matching is an insanely interesting competition.  If there is one competition that has it all - image, text, OCR, mutiple approaches to tackle - it would be this. I am sure we will have an exciting finish. This is also a very relevant industry problem and I would like to thank the organisers and Kaggle staff for hosting this competition. The kernels by ragnar and chris and the discussion topics by rohitsingh & tensorgirl & knownothing and several others have been very useful and educative for me."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

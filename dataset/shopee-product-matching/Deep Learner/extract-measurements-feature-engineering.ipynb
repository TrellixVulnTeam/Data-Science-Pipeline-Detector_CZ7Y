{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Extract Measurements \n\n---\n\nAround 20% of the products in the dataset contain some kind of measurement (24mm Tape, 980gr powder, 1 kg coffee). \n\nA King size bed is 76” x 80” and is also known as an Eastern King bed. A California King bed, marketed toward taller people, is 72” x 84”. If you can extract measurements, you can differentiate between 100 gram coffee vs 250 gm coffee, 8 pack coke vs 6 pack coke, or 32 GB iphone vs 64 GB iphone. Over 6000 items in the listing have at least one measurement in them.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### If you fork or use this notebook, do leave an upvote!"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd \n\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/shopee-product-matching/train.csv')\nlabel_to_images = train.groupby('label_group').posting_id.unique().to_dict()\ntrain['target'] = train.label_group.apply(lambda label: label_to_images[label])\ntrain.sample(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import re \ndef is_measurement(word): \n    measurement_cats = ['kg', 'g', 'cm', 'pcs', 'gb', 'ml', 'mm', 'gr', 'gram']\n    for m in measurement_cats: \n        pat = '(\\d+)' + m + ''\n        res = re.findall(pat, word)\n        if res != []: \n            return f' {m} '.join(res) + ' ' + m\n\n    for m in measurement_cats: \n        pat = '(\\d+) ' + m + ''\n        res = re.findall(pat, word)\n        if res != []: \n            return f' {m} '.join(res) + ' ' + m\n        \n        \n    return False \n\ntrain['measurement'] = train.title.apply(is_measurement)\nnum_products_with_measurement = len(train) - (train.measurement == False).sum()\nprint(f'{num_products_with_measurement} products containing measurements found!')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### If you have any suggestions or improvements, do comment below.

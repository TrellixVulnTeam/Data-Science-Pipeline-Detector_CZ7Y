One of the most enduring examples is the telestrator\n, first used in the NFL by John Madden at the 1982 Super Bowl. The legendary coach and iconic commentator used the electronic chalkboard to explain plays with X’s and O’s, and it has since been used countless times to help viewers understand the game. Madden also demonstrated how AR can improve the entertainment aspect of watching a game as he delighted fans with things like excessive doodling and tips on how to carve a turducken.\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/JohnM-TX/misc/raw/main/madden_ensemble.png\" width=\"700\">","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"AR also provides cues during a game to **help viewers quickly understand** what is happening and what might happen next. The yellow first down line is a perfect example here. Fans at all levels of experience benefit from seeing this information right on the field. It greatly reduces the amount of brain work that’s required without the line --  looking at the down marker, adjusting for camera angle, looking back to the ball’s location, all while trying to keep one’s eye on the action.

A 2019 study on engaging sports fans found that the visual appeal of AR is \"very influential\" on the degree of positive word of mouth. [1] In the NFL, coaches and teams now rely heavily on Next Gen Stats and analytics. Fans with a high appetite for analysis subscribe to NFL Game Pass and watch Thursday Night Football on Prime Video. And as the NFL expands its presence in eight countries later this year, attracting new fans to the game will partly depend on how easily they can understand it.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id='bg'></a>\n<div class=\"h2\">Design</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Our contribution to AR for football, video zone segmentation,  is based on bringing viewers the benefits listed above for kickoff and punt returns. We used the following principles to guide our design:\n-\tHelp viewers interpret what they see during a return\n-\tAdapt to dynamic broadcast camera views in addition to the more stable NFL coaches view\n-\tTake advantage of “preattentive attributes” of the human brain: color, shape, and spatial positioning\n-\tMinimize any distraction from added graphics\n\nWith these principles in mind, we formed our initial concept of helping viewers see where each team controls space on the field. We use the term “controlling space” in a general sense. It can also be thought of as accessibility. Some examples:\n-\tIf two players are running toward a space, the player who will reach it first controls it\n-\tIf one or more players is blocking another player, each player controls the space on his side of the block (generally behind him)\n-\tThe returner can only control the space where he is likely to gain first access. \n\nThe picture below shows how segmenting zones between teams helps viewers interpret the action. The left-hand frame shows how a viewer might interpret this scene where the Cowboys are returning a punt. The three red arrows show a defender, a blocker, and the returner with the ball. It appears that the three players will reach the X at the same time, or the blocker in the middle might turn and intercept his opponent to protect the ball carrier.\n\n<img src=\"https://github.com/JohnM-TX/misc/raw/main/cowboys.png\" width=\"1200\">\n\nBut this interpretation would be wrong. The sideline perspective from the camera distorts the actual scale by quite a bit. Notice the yellow arrows showing 30 feet downfield and laterally. One is twice as long as the other as drawn on the image. Looking at the middle frame, we see the reality of the field. The defender is nowhere near the X and would miss the defender by a large margin if he were to run at that angle. \n\nThe picture in the right-hand frame shows zone segmentation with the proper perspective. All three players are running at a shallow angle  with the ball carrier working toward the sideline. The shading between the defender and blocker correctly shows the space closest to them and suggests a likely angle of interception. To be fair, the human brain is pretty good at judging perspective when watching the video. But it takes mental work to go back and forth, judging rates of closure and the changing positions on the screen as the camera pans and zooms. The colored zones give a nice visual cue and allow viewers to take in additional aspects of the game.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here’s another example where zone partitioning shows what’s happening.

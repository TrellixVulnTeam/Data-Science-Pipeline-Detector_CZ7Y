While metrics have been created left and right for both offense and defense, special teams has been left relatively ignored. In a sport where each team is constantly trying to establish better field position, kickoff returns are a gold mine to give a team an edge before their offense or defense even takes the field. This study will apply machine learning methods in order to effectively gauge effciency of both the kickoff unit and the kickoff return unit, attempting to isolate any competitive advantages either unit has over the other. \n\n\n![](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/justin-tucker-of-the-baltimore-ravens-kicks-off-during-the-second-of-picture-id1272376932?s=612x612)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Return Yards over Expected Model","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In order to accurately judge the individual skill of the kick returner, I built an Expected Return Yards model (I know. *So Innovative.*).\nDespite the countless numbers of Expected Yards models that are already populating the analytics space, the reality is that its simply the best and most reliable method of isolating an individual players production from the system around him. \n\n# Feature Set\n1. Football tracking data\n\n    Since we don't have any data on who the ball carrier is, the next best this is to track the football itself. The primary features used were the Football's X and Y coordinates, the football's speed, and the football's acceleration.\n    \n2. Return Team\n    \n    I used the features from the closest four blockers in each frame. The closest blocker will always be carrying the football because the data goes from the frame that the ball was caught to the frame that the returner was tackled (or scored). The features are the distance of each blocker from the ball, as well as the speed, direction and acceleration of each blocker. \n\n3. Kicking Team\n    \n    The features from the kicking team were pretty much identical to the features for the return team. The only main difference, besides the data itself, is that only the three closest members are accounted for, as opposed to four. This is due to the fact that the closest return team member is always holding the ball, so in reality only the three closest blockers for each were used in the dataset. \n    \n    \n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benKeener/BigDataBowl2021/main/BDB%20images/feature%20list.png)    \n    \n# Methods\n    \n   For the Expected Return Yards model I used good old XGBoost, everyone's favorite machine learning tool. While gradient boosting is a somewhat overused tool, its efficiency and accuracy tandem is optimal for this sort of project. While other machine learning methods, such as a  multilayer perceptron (only takes 1-D input data), resNet-50 (would probably still be training right now), or LSTM(tried it. horrible results), may provide different results given enough time, the efficiency of gradient boosting allows for incredibly fine gridsearches, which then leads to more accurate results in a shorter timeframe.\n   \n   For the training and test data, I went with a 75-25 split of all of the plays that resulted in a kick being returned. The training method was a stratified ten k-fold cross validation with a maximum of 100000 epochs and early stopping after 25 rounds with no improvement shown in the test set. For the hyperparameter tuning I used a randomized gridsearch, then used the hyperparamter set with the lowest RMSE (root mean squared error). \n   \n   <h1><center>$RMSE = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}{\\Big(\\frac{d_i -f_i}{\\sigma_i}\\Big)^2}} $</center></h1>\n   \n      \n   The training itself ran for 27000 epochs and achived a RMSE of 5.5, a good score considering that the labels ranged from 0-100, as opposed to the typical 0-1 that is most prevalent when utilizing the RMSE metric.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"   \n# Do Returners Matter?\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benKeener/BigDataBowl2021/main/BDB%20images/bdb_density.png)\n\nWe all know the old adage that \"Runningbacks don't matter\", an idea stemmed from the evidence showing that much of a running back's production is reliant on blocking and the difference between an elite running back and just a \"good\" one is negligible. While idea that blockers affect the success of the ball carrier does hold some weight in the return game as well, there do appear to be noticable differences between good and bad return men. By having a good return man, the potential for larger chunck plays increases greatly, while at the same time limiting the frequency of bad return plays. The figure above displays the RYOE frequencies of the top 5 and bottom 5 returners. The top 5 returners all showed \"large gain potential\", while also having a mean RYOE slightly less skewed right than that of the bottom 5 returners. The bottom 5 returners, while they showed more consistency, had less \"large gain potential\" while also having a negative RYOE on average. Although the difference in field position on a play to play basis may not always be apparent, the mitigation of risk accompanied by the higher probability of a large gain makes elite return men incredibly valuable within the special teams unit. \n\n\n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benKeener/BigDataBowl2021/main/BDB%20images/all%20returns.png)\n\n\n\nWhile it seems that returners do matter in deciding field position, where it becomes difficult is figuring out *which* returners are valuable. As you can see in the figure above of the top ten RYOE seasons over the past 3 years, there aren't any repeat names, which I found odd. Surely names like Cordarrelle Patterson or Jamal Agnew could find themselves in the top 10 multiple times. However, RYOE is relatively unstable from season to season. While it's useful on a per game basis, it shouldn't be used to project players performances in future seasons.

In neutral situations, the returner should not be taking the ball out of the endzone at all. Over the last three years, kickoffs returned out of the endzone was downed at an average of 24.8 yards from the endzone and a median of the 23 yard line. Even the best kick returners failed to make it past the 25 yard line, with only six returners being downed past the 25 yardline 50 percent of the time","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benKeener/BigDataBowl2021/main/BDB%20images/touchback%20returns.png)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Of the top 10 leaders in RYOE on returns caught in the endzone, only one of them, Deonte Harris in 2019, had a median return past the 25 yard line. Special Teams in 2021 are simply too fast and too skilled at tackling to allow frequent large returns from balls that are caught in the endzone. By returning a ball caught in the endzone, the returner is essentially giving the kicking team a 1-2 yard headstart.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# What can the kicker do to mitigate damage?\nSimply put, the best thing a kicker can do to prevent solid returns is to avoid bad kicks. I understand that it's easier said than done, but the best thing a kicker can do, especially when facing a kick returner with a strong RYOE, is to kick it out of bounds. By pinning the ball deep, kickers can avoid long returns and sometimes avoid returns all together. \n\n![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benKeener/BigDataBowl2021/main/BDB%20images/kickers.png)\n\nWil Lutz is a prime example of a kicker that sets his defense up well. Over 77% of his kickoffs are touchbacks, eliminating the possibility of the return team gaining better field position. Less than 7%(!) of his kicks are \"bad kicks\", which I have defined as a kickoff that has an expected return yard value greater than 25, which is that value of a touchback. 93% of Lutz's kicks are expected to reach the 25 yard line or shorter, giving a sizeable advantage to the Saints defense on the following series. \n\n# Use of my Findings and Future Work\n\nIdeally, teams would implement the strategy of working towards more touchbacks, something the NFL has been encouraging, thus the movement of the spot of the ball after a touchback from the 20 to the 25. Over the past three years there have only been 14 individual kicker seasons with a touchback rate of 70% or higher. By kicking the touchback, the kicking team completely takes an electric kick returner out of the game, while at the same time achieving quality field position for the defense. \n\nI would have liked to have data over more years. Having ten years worth of tracking data rather than three would allow me to further research the predictive capabilities of the expected return yards model. My initial thoughts were to use a resNet-50 as the expected yards model, however, training a resNet is rather time consuming, so I scrapped it. Given infinite time I most likely would have used the resNet or possibly another form of neural net, rather than the gradient boosting method applied in this notebook. I also developed a field goal over expected model using the NFL weather data and nflfastR data. I could possibly use that and the kickoff metrics to create a sort of \"catch all metric\" for kicker production. \n\n\n# Conclusion\n\nLooking at the data, it is very apparent that any advantage that the return team will have lies in their personnel. Theres no fancy strategy involved on the return side of the ball, as the main strategy is just having good players. However, on the kicking teams side it becomes a completely different story.  Like in many competetive games, the strategic advantage goes to the player who moves first, as they are able to dictate the iniitial flow of the game. By simply kicking the ball into or out of the back of the endzone, the kicking team is able to win the series automatically. If the ball is kicked out of the back of the endzone, it is placed at the 25. If it is caught in the endzone, the return team is immediately at a disadvantage, as they have spotted 1-2 yards to the kicking team. By reliquishing the posibility of an incredible stop at the 10 yard line and accepting the 25 yards accompanied by a touchback, kicking teams are able to completely nullify even the best return men. \n\nOddly enough, sometimes the best way to win the game is to avoid playing it all together. \n\n\n\n# Code and DataViz: \n\nhttps://github.com/benKeener/BigDataBowl2021\n\n\n\n","metadata":{}}]}

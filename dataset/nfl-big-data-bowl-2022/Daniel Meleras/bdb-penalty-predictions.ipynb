This is to avoid leakage. \n* Kickoffs don't have a down and every single punt happened on fourth down, so I'll get rid of the down column\n* I need to test whether absoluteYardlineNumber measures from one team's end or a stadium-specific end [(see below)](#yardline).\n* I'm going to assume that who the kicker or returner is has no bearing on whether or not there was a penalty and get rid of the kickerId  and returnerId column; this is justifiable because I will be including data about each specific kick. I did a brief examination [below](#kickers-returners) but some kickers and returners have been involved with plays with a large amount of penalties. (Note: I'm going to do an exploration on which kickers and returners have been involved with the most plays with penalties. It's not done yet but I am going to link to it [here]()).\n* Going to use quarter as a proxy for the time and get rid of the gameClock column.\n* Such a small quantity of non-Nan's in the passResult column that I'm just going to remove it.\n\nIn addition. the returnYardage column has a bunch of NaN values, that I'll replace with 0. \n\nThe [special teams result](#specialTeamResult) column seems to a somewhat valuable predictor, so it will be kept and one-hot encoded. Some of the encoding of categorical features will need to be done after the dataset is split between kickoffs and punts, and some before. Click [here](#encoding) to jump to the encoding section.\n\nNext, I'm going to split the data into kickoffs and punts, as there are differences between them that should be handled.

Let's sum up the number of penalties for each.\n#### Kickers and Returners\nFor some reason, a few kickers have a huge number of penalties resulting from their kicks. This will be explored elsewhere and I'll link to it here when it's done. A surface level examination is below; click here to skip to below it. For example, we can see below that kicker 40113's kicks had 45 penalties; the average was 9.3 (red line) and the median was 8 (yellow line).\n\nThe situation for returners is similar.\n\nFor the time being, I'm going to assume the identity of the kicker or returner is irrelevant and remove it.\n\n[Back to Plays Data Navigator](#plays-data-nav)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def whatsup_with_the_kickers(plays_df):\n    \"\"\"Takes in the original plays DataFrame and returns the processed one.\"\"\"\n    \n    df = plays_df.copy()\n    \n    # add penalty flag column\n    df['penaltyFlag'] = df['penaltyCodes'].notnull().astype(int)\n    \n    kickers = df[['kickerId', 'penaltyFlag']]\n    kickers = kickers.groupby(['kickerId']).sum().sort_values('penaltyFlag', ascending=False)\n    kickers = kickers.reset_index()\n    \n    # plot the penalties for each kicker\n    plt.figure(figsize=(14,10))\n    ax = sns.barplot(x=kickers.index, y=kickers[\"penaltyFlag\"])\n    # horizontal lines for median, mean\n    ax.axhline(kickers.describe().loc['mean','penaltyFlag'], color='red')\n    ax.axhline(kickers.describe().loc['50%','penaltyFlag'], color='yellow')\n    ax.set_xticklabels(kickers.kickerId)\n    for item in ax.get_xticklabels(): item.set_rotation(90)\n    plt.show()\n    \n    \n    return kickers, kickers.describe()['penaltyFlag'], kickers.describe().loc['50%','penaltyFlag']","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-16T19:12:31.427403Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-16T19:12:31.427616Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-16T19:12:31.43719Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-16T19:12:31.427591Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-16T19:12:31.436292Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"whatsup_with_the_kickers(plays)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-16T19:12:31.438381Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-16T19:12:31.438594Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-16T19:12:33.002472Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-16T19:12:31.438571Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-16T19:12:33.001619Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=encoding></a>\n### Encoding\nI'm going to define a general one-hot encoding function that will take in a dataframe, the column to encode, and a prefix and return a new Dataframe with the column encoded.\n\n[Back to Plays Data Navigator](#plays-data-nav)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def onehot_encode(df, column, prefix):\n    df = df.copy()\n    \n    dummies = pd.get_dummies(df[column], prefix=prefix)\n    df = pd.concat([df,dummies],axis=1)\n    df = df.drop(column, axis=1)\n    \n    return df","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-16T19:12:33.003527Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-16T19:12:33.00372Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-16T19:12:33.008796Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-16T19:12:33.003698Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-16T19:12:33.008005Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"process_plays(plays)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-16T19:12:33.009707Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-16T19:12:33.010045Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-16T19:12:33.54074Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-16T19:12:33.010018Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-16T19:12:33.539898Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plays_data = onehot_encode(process_plays(plays), 'possessionTeam', 'team')\nplays_data","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-16T19:12:33.542083Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-16T19:12:33.542289Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-16T19:12:34.073102Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-16T19:12:33.542266Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-16T19:12:34.072227Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"scouting-data\"></a>\n## Scouting Data\n\nThe third and final dataset we'll bring in is the PFF scouting data.

Timing is taken from impact with foot to impact with the ground or a player. (numeric)\n* **kickType**: Kickoff or Punt Type (text).\n* * Possible values for kickoff plays:\n* * * D: Deep - your normal deep kick with decent hang time\n* * * F: Flat - different than a Squib in that it will have some hang time and no roll but has a lower trajectory and hang time than a Deep kick off\n* * * K: Free Kick - Kick after a safety\n* * * O: Obvious Onside - score and situation dictates the need to regain possession. Also the hands team is on for the returning team\n* * * P: Pooch kick - high for hangtime but not a lot of distance - usually targeting an upman\n* * * Q: Squib - low-line drive kick that bounces or rolls considerably, with virtually no hang time\n* * * S: Surprise Onside - accounting for score and situation an onsides kick that the returning team doesn’t expect. Hands teams probably aren't on the field\n* * * B: Deep Direct OOB - Kickoff that is aimed deep (regular kickoff) that goes OOB directly (doesn't bounce)\n* * Possible values for punt plays:\n* * * N: Normal - standard punt style\n* * * R: Rugby style punt\n* * * A: Nose down or Aussie-style punts\n* **kickDirectionIntended**: Intended kick direction from the kicking team's perspective - based on how coverage unit sets up and other factors (L: Left, R: Right, C: Center, text).\n* **kickDirectionActual**: Actual kick direction from the kicking team's perspective (L: Left, R: Right, C: Center, text).\n* **returnDirectionIntended**: The return direction the punt return or kick off return unit is set up for from the return team's perspective (L: Left, R: Right, C: Center, text).\n* **returnDirectionActual**: Actual return direction from the return team's perspective (L: Left, R: Right, C: Center, text).\n* **missedTacklers**: Jersey number and team code of player(s) charged with a missed tackle on the play. It will be reasonable to assume that he should have brought down the ball carrier and failed to do so. This situation does not have to entail contact, but it most frequently does. Missed tackles on a QB by a pass rusher are also included here. Multiple missed tacklers on a play are separated by a ; (text).\n* **assistTacklers**: Jersey number and team code of player(s) assisting on the tackle. Multiple assist tacklers on a play are separated by a ; (text).\n* **tacklers**: Jersey number and team code of player making the tackle (text).\n* **kickoffReturnFormation**: 3 digit code indicating the number of players in the Front Wall, Mid Wall and Back Wall (text).\n* **gunners**: Jersey number and team code of player(s) lined up as gunner on punt unit.

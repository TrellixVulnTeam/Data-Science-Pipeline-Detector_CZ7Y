Punts that result in a return only account for about 38% of punts from the 2018, 2019, and 2020 seasons. So while the plays are fairly infrequent, they could have a large impact on a game. \n\nTo do this, I modeled how many yards, on the x axis, that a returner would gain on a frameID level, for a play that was a punt and had a return. To get the data prepared for modeling, I went through a very thorough feature engineering process that is detailed below. With the data in hand, I was able to generate a very accurate model to predict how many yards that a punt returner would be expected to gain, given the current situation as of that frame. By \"current situation\" I mean the location of the returner, how fast they are moving, their direction and orientation, how far away kick return and kick defending players are from the returner and their movement attributes (speed, acceleration, etc), and game specific attributes (time, score, etc). The model was trained on data from 2018 and 2019 and the final model was ran on 2020 data to generate the metric results.\n\nTo create the metric, I subtracted the predicted yards gained in a frame from the actual yards gained in a frame (essentially the error/residual). A positive value would suggest that the returner gained more yards than \"expected\" whereas a negative value would suggest that the returner gained less yards than expected. I believe that this is appropriate given how accurate the model was. If it was less accurate, then I do not think this would have been worth the effort. Since this was done on a frame level, I aggregated the results by Game and Play to know the results for a given punt return play. \n\nWith the results in hand, evaluation could be done on a play level, a player level, and a team level. Please continue to read the notebook to learn more! \n\n\n*Note: Not all of the work was completed in python. In fact, all of the feature engineering was conducted in GCP's BigQuery. Links to all queries are provided in the appropriate sections.*","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<br>\n<br>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"***","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Load Data and EDA","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport numpy as np\nimport time\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nimport xgboost as xgb\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.metrics import r2_score,mean_squared_error, mean_absolute_error\n\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\npd.set_option('display.max_rows', None)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-02T17:30:40.314293Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-02T17:30:40.314822Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-02T17:30:41.80686Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-02T17:30:40.31471Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-02T17:30:41.805953Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load plays data and perform basic exploration of punt data\n\nplays = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2022/plays.csv')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-02T17:30:43.703237Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-02T17:30:43.703558Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-02T17:30:43.885217Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-02T17:30:43.703525Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-02T17:30:43.883826Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# What is the shape of the plays file (rows x columns)\n\nplays.shape","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-02T17:30:45.865356Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-02T17:30:45.865675Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-02T17:30:45.875058Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-02T17:30:45.865641Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-02T17:30:45.873836Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# What are the columns present?\n\nplays.columns","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-01-02T17:30:47.475019Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-01-02T17:30:47.476295Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-01-02T17:30:47.483946Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-01-02T17:30:47.476229Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-01-02T17:30:47.482819Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<br>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\"\"\"\nUsing this guide, we know what each of the columns are, but will provide a brief exploration (https://www.kaggle.com/c/nfl-big-data-bowl-2022/data)\n\nLet's evaluate a few key variables from the plays table\n\"\"\"\n# Evaluate playResult, but only on a punt.

However, in this section, I will detail my thought process and provide a data dictionary of the final features created. \n\n\nSince this project was focused on modeling returner yards on a punt return, I needed to have the rows contain as much detail as possible to create a robust enough model. With the level of granularity provided by the Tracking files, I knew that this is where I would spend the majority of my efforts. After vigorous exploration, I determined that only focusing on frameID level rows, with the returner's current tracking situation (x, y, s, etc) and each of the other players' data on the same row would be necessary for modeling. To clarify, I needed to know the returner's tracking data and each of the players' tracking data in relation to the returner's at the frameID level. I included some additional game situation variables (like score differential, time situation, etc) to add in context to the play. Below, I provide a high level overview of the process I took and below that, I will provide the file used for training and testing the model.  \n\nLink to Code: https://github.com/seanwsullivan1/NFL-Big-Data-Bowl-2022/blob/main/2022_NFL_BDB_SQL_DataPrep_FeatureEngineering.txt","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<br>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## SQL Feature Engineering Process:\n\n- **Aggregate all tracking data from 2018, 2019, and 2020 files that were associated with plays that were: SpecialTeamsPlayType = 'Punt' and specialTeamsResult = 'Return'**\n\n\n- **Determine frameID, by gameID and playID where the ball was snapped, where the final event (not a None event), and the frameID one past the final event frameID.** This is necessary because I needed the x value for the next frame after the final event so that I could determine yards gained.

Seeing that the most important features are ones that describe the state of the returner (direction, speed, x position, orientation, y position, and acceleration) makes sense. A returner's ability to gain yards certainly would appear to be dependent on their movement at that time. Additionally, seeing many kicking players' distance features show as highly important also passes the taste test. Having defenders near the returner would likely limit their ability to gain yards. It would work the other way too, where defenders being further away would make it more likely to enable a returner's ability to gain yards. I am a little surprised that the features that described the number of kicking team or returning team players within X yards of the returner did not show as more important. In conclusion, I am not totally surprised to see the results above. It has proven that the effort taken in the feature engineering stage was worth while.

As you already know, Jakeem Grant was one of the best returners in terms of total return yards gained and Kalif Raymond was one of the better, but not the best. We also already know that Raymond was the best punt returner based on PRYOE and Grant was one of the worst. \n\n\"Rec_to_Kick_5YRD_AVG_Diff_Rank\" is the difference of the average returning team member count within 5 yards of the returner and the average kicking team member count within 5 yards, but ranked amongst the players. Basically, on average (on a frame level), how many more returner teammates are within 5 yards of the returner than kicking team members. The higher the rank, the more, on average, teammates within 5 yards than opponents. Which, would suggest despite the crowdedness, that the returner had teammates providing blocking/resitance to the kicking team. In this case, Raymond was 30th out of 34 (filtered out to only include returners with 8 or more returns) and Grant was 7th out of 34. This tells us that Raymond typically had more defenders than teammates within 5 yards of him and Grant had the opposite. So, this would suggest that Grant had a better blocking situation whereas Raymond did not. This may hint at Raymond having superior returning \"vision\", but this can not be proven with this information. \n\n\"KB1_Frame_Per_Return\" is counting the number of frames, per play, with more than one kicking team player within 5 yards of the returner, but ranked amongst the players. This is providing insight to how much pressure a returner faces on a typical play. This is slightly inflated if a returner is known to \"run around\" quite a bit and accumulate more frames within a play, so take this with a grain of salt. But, with that said, Grant ranks 5th highest for frames with defenders within 5 yards per play and Raymond ranks 15th. \n\nThese two measurements present conflicting insight on a high level, but provide insight nonetheless. Grant typically had more teammtes than defenders within 5 yards than Raymond, but Grant typically had more defenders, on a frame level, within 5 yards of him. This may be an indicator into why Grant underperformed so badly when evaluated with PRYOE. On the other hand, Raymond typically had more defenders within 5 yards of him than teammates, but he was middle fo the pack regarding the number of frames with defenders within 5 yards of him. Given that Raymond tended to have a tougher \"situation\" and that he outperformed his expecation, it is reasonable to ponder what his punt returning performance would be with a better blocking scheme.

Using this criteria, **the Buffalo Bills** are one of the strongest punting units. Their PRYOE per play as a returning unit is slightly above 0.4 yards and as a kicking team, it is about -1.5 yards.

Should this metric take over in place of actual return yards gained? Probably not. But, I do think that it possess value for a few different areas of relevance. \n\n**Value Proposition 1: Post Performance Evaluation**\nPRYOE provides insight into how a returner (or kicking unit) performed relative to how they would be expected to perform given the situation of the punt return. As shown in the above section, insight can be given into if a returner was due more credit for their over performance or if their blocking unit provided a beneficial boost to the return. It is a method that begins to get to the individual contribution that the returner has on a play. \n\n\n**Value Proposition 2: In Game Strategy**\nTeams would be able to layer in this metric to help guide in game strategic decision making. For example, perhaps the Chicago Bears are playing the Buffalo Bills and know that the Bills have one of the best units on a kicking defense PRYOE per play basis. Knowing this, the Special Teams Coordinator may encourage their returner to take a fair catch or allow a punt to drop in order to maximize starting position for the ensuing drive. \n\n\nI also think that this PRYOE metric is a piece to a decision optimization problem: what is the optimal choice for a punt return (return, fair catch, let bounce)? By creating a very robust RYOE model, this tackles the first part of this decision making equation. Models would need to be developed to estimate how a punt would bounce and then provide the expected return yards, fair catch location, and bounced punt location on a given punt, in order to determine if a decision was optimal. I am aware of a few BDB projects doing this and am excited to see their finished products. ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<br>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Limitations and Next Steps\n\nAs I mentioned in the value discussion above, there is a limitation to the PRYOE metric due to how narrow its scope is. \n\nIn terms of a next step, I think it would be worth expanding some of the player tracking features. Perhaps including features that provide information on how close players are to each other (and not just the returner) would aid in the accuracy of the model. This sort of robust feature set could also be a launching point for quantifying impact of individual players' on a given play. For example, perhaps we'd be able to quantify a kicking team defender's impact on limiting return yards or we could quantify a player on the returning team's impact on blocking and creating more return yards. However, a discussion would need to be had on how much impact this would truly bring to a team and the sports analyics community. Essentially, is the juice worth the squeeze given the number of punt returns that happen within a given season? Reagrdless, it would set the wheels in motion for similar analyses that could be performed on other actions within a football game.

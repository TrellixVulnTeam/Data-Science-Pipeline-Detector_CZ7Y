Back in 2010, the San Diego Chargers had the #1 Offense AND the #1 Defense, yet failed to even make the postseason due to poor Special Teams play.

For most kickoffs, both teams are usually content to accept a \"touchback\" where the ball is kicked into the endzone and the return team chooses not to return it. A touchback places the ball at the 25-yard line, which we can use as the cutoff for \"good\" and \"bad\" coverage.\n\nOne way we can separate kickoffs is based on Kick Length. Kickers are not perfect, but they are professionals. If a kick travels less than 50 yards in the NFL, it's fairly safe to assume that it was not intended to be a 'full' kickoff, otherwise the return team could have only a very short distance to cover.\n\nOnce we have the data separated in this way, we can start sorting each dataframe by team. This will allow us to analyze each team's performance separately, before comparing side-by-side to see which Special Teams units perform the best (or worst).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"full_kicks = kickoffs.loc[kickoffs['kickLength'] >= 50]\n\nteams = kickoffs.possessionTeam.unique()\nteams\n\nteamData = pd.DataFrame()\nfor team in teams:\n    team_kicks = full_kicks.loc[full_kicks['possessionTeam'] == team]\n    total_kicks = team_kicks.shape[0]\n    touchbackPercentage = team_kicks.loc[team_kicks['specialTeamsResult'] == 'Touchback'].shape[0] * 100 / total_kicks\n    goodCoveragePercentage = team_kicks.loc[team_kicks['playResult'] > 40].shape[0] * 100 / total_kicks\n    badCoveragePercentage = team_kicks.loc[team_kicks['playResult'] < 40].shape[0] * 100 / total_kicks\n    teamVals = {'Team': team, 'Touchback %': touchbackPercentage, 'Good Coverage %': goodCoveragePercentage, 'Bad Coverage %': badCoveragePercentage}\n    teamData = teamData.append(teamVals, ignore_index = True)\n\n# sort by teams with the lowest percentage of bad coverage\nteamData = teamData.sort_values(by=['Bad Coverage %'])\nteamData\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-18T07:26:41.843156Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-18T07:26:41.843537Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-18T07:26:42.044215Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-12-18T07:26:41.843494Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-12-18T07:26:42.043314Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Looking at the data, some initial trends are apparent.

This 2022 NFL Big Data Bowl project is our attempt to do so.\n\nThe basic idea is as follows:\n### Model \nWe begin by regressing the tracking data of kick returns, as summarized by 100 features, onto the value of a kick return. Note that the _value_ of a yard line is the expected points of the next score if you start at that yard line, and so the value of a kick return is simply the value of the end yard line of the kick return. This regression yields a function $\\hat{f}$ which, given the tracking data of a kick return frame, returns the expected value of that kick return frame.\n\n### Predict\nGiven $\\hat{f}$ and the tracking data of all players on the field during a given kick return frame, we compute the kick returner's optimal next location by maximizing $\\hat{f}$ over a set of candidate next locations for the kick returner. With this, we can compute the optimal kick return location at any frame, and we can compute a complete optimal kick return path by repeating the procedure over sequential frames. \n\n### Evaluate players\nWe conclude our study by comparing actual kick return movements to our computed optimal movements, and by devising a metric to judge a kick returner's decision making.","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.006948,"end_time":"2022-01-05T04:15:27.587515","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-01-05T04:15:27.580567","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"id":"0975b9bd"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# The Regression\n\nWe use a multiple linear regression model primarily because we want control over an *explicit* model of kick return decision-making with interpretable and actionable weights associated with each input feature. We could instead use a neural network to (potentially) improve predictive power, but neural nets lack interpretability, and so we would not be able to say with any certainty *why* our model suggested certain return paths. Of course, predictive power is important, so this is a good area for future work. \n\n## Response Column\n\nOur response variable (dependent variable) is $V$, the \"value\" of the ending yard line of a kickoff return. We define the value of a yardline $z$, where $z$ means $z$ yards away from scoring a touchdown, as the expected number of points of the next score given that you start with a first down at yard line $z$. To find $V_z$ for each $z$, we simply take the average value of all points of the next score from every first down at yard line $z$ from 2010 to 2018. Then, we smooth these values. We performed this computation using `nflFastR` data in a separate project [1]. Below is a plot of $V_z$ as a function of $z$.\n\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1tbbTe1ws0iG02XtUi2VPHZGHWa64nur8)\n\nFor the remiander of the project, we use the $x$ coordinate of the $\\{(x,y)\\}$ grid representing the football field, where $x \\in [0,120]$ denotes the yard line, $y\\in [0,53.3]$ denotes the latitude, and the origin $(0,0)$ denotes the bottom left corner of the field. Thus the value of a kick return ending at yardline $x$ is $V_{110-x}$.\n\n## Feature: Kick Returner's Yardline\n\n$x_{kr}$, the $x$ yardline of the kick return in the current frame, is a feature because the value of a kick return frame depends on how close the kick returner is to the endzone.\n\n## Feature: $j^{th}$-Projected-Gap-Distance\n\nFor each $j \\in \\{1,...,11\\}$, we find the $y$-distance to the $j^{th}$ closest defender when the kick returner is projected onto the average $x$ location of the defenders. Mathematically, letting $kr$ be the index of the kick returner, $dj$ be the index of the $j^{th}$ closest defender, and $\\theta = -(dir_{kr} - 90)$, the feature is given by\n$$\\Delta y_{dj} = (y_{dj} - y_{kr}) + (\\frac{1}{11}\\sum_{j=1}^{11}x_{dj} - x_{kr})\\cdot \\tan(\\theta).$$\n\nHere is a picture which illustrates the feature.\n\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1RReSGzmIbjJ8-tV6SWtmBq1s2NrUJv0i)\n\n\n## Indicator Variable: $j^{th}$-Defender-Cannot-Catch-The-Kick-Returner \n\nLetting $dj$ denote the $j^{th}$ closest defender to the kick returner, we want an indicator variable\n\n$$C_j = \\unicode{x1D7D9}\\{ dj \\text{ cannot catch }  kr\\}.$$\n\nWe define $C_j$ as 1 if and only if $dj$ cannot get to the intersection $**$ in the explanatory image below before $kr$, which is calculated using the locations, speed, and direction of the $kr$ and $dj$. Note that $C_j$ itself is not a feature, but will be used in a feature below.\n\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1rJHev2T2Jn8FqJUkC3jwZKAPfvP_uiZv)\n\n## Indicator Variable: $j^{th}$-Defender-Is-Blocked \n\nLetting $dj$ denote the $j^{th}$ closest defender to the kick returner, we want an indicator variable\n\n$$B_j = \\unicode{x1D7D9}\\{ dj \\text{ is blocked} \\}.$$\n\nWe define $B_j$ as 1 if and only if a blocker can get to the intersection $*$ in the explanatory image below before $dj$, which is calculated using the locations, speed, and direction of the blockers and $dj$. $B_j$ itself is not a feature, but will be used in a feature below.\n\n**Note**: we assume that each blocker is only able to block a single defender. Defenders and blockers are considered in order of their proximity to the kick returner. For instance, we first consider the closest defender; if a blocker can intercept them, that blocker is ineligible when we consider the second closest defender. Thus, the $j$th defender is blocked if and only if their is an *available* defender that can reach intersection $*$ first. \n\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1o35rS5CHW0Cpk3pu83F88sJDvpfUcA29)\n\n## Feature: Segmented Distance to the $j^{th}$ Closest Defender\n\nFirst, let\n\n$$A_j = (1-B_j) \\cdot (1 - C_j)$$\n\nbe the $j^{th}$-_Able-to-Tackle_ indicator variable, which is 1 if and only if the $j^{th}$ defender can catch $kr$ and is not blocked. \n\nDenote the distance between the kick returner $kr$ and the $j^{th}$ closest defender $dj$ as\n$$d(kr,dj) := \\sqrt{(x_{kr}-x_{dj})^2 + (y_{kr}-y_{dj})^2}.$$\n\nLet $\\lambda_1$ and $\\lambda_2$ be hyperparameters encoding how close $kr$ and $dj$ are in terms of $x$-distance in yards. For now, we set $\\lambda_1 = 2$ and $\\lambda_2 = 2$. If inclined, we can do a cross validation to determine better values for these hyperparameters.\n\nThen, in our regression, we want terms indicating the distance of $kr$ to $dj$, with different coefficients depending on whether the defender is in front of or behind the kicker, whether the defender is blocked, and whether the defender can catch the kick returner. For example, a defender who is 5 yards away from the kick returner should be treated differently depending on whether he is blocked or not. Also, a defender who is 1 yard away from the kick returner should be treated differently depending on whether he is in front of or behind the returner. Defenders can have a vastly different impact on the outcome of the play depending on these conditions.\n\nSo, for the $j^{th}$ defender, we have 8 _segmented-distance_ features:\n\n\\begin{align*}\n  & d(kr,dj)  \\cdot \\unicode{x1D7D9}\\{ x_{kr} - x_{dj} \\in (\\lambda_1,\\infty) \\} \\cdot A_j \\\\\n  & d(kr,dj) \\cdot \\unicode{x1D7D9}\\{ x_{kr} - x_{dj} \\in (\\lambda_1,\\infty) \\} \\cdot (1-A_j)  \\\\\n  & d(kr,dj)  \\cdot\\unicode{x1D7D9}\\{ x_{kr} - x_{dj} \\in (0,\\lambda_1] \\} \\cdot A_j \\\\\n  & d(kr,dj)  \\cdot\\unicode{x1D7D9}\\{ x_{kr} - x_{dj} \\in (0,\\lambda_1] \\} \\cdot (1-A_j) \\\\\n  & d(kr,dj) \\cdot \\unicode{x1D7D9}\\{ x_{kr} - x_{dj} \\in (-\\lambda_2,0] \\} \\cdot A_j  \\\\\n  & d(kr,dj)  \\cdot \\unicode{x1D7D9}\\{ x_{kr} - x_{dj} \\in (-\\lambda_2,0] \\} \\cdot (1-A_j) \\\\\n  & d(kr,dj) \\cdot \\unicode{x1D7D9}\\{ x_{kr} - x_{dj} \\in (-\\infty, -\\lambda_2] \\} \\cdot A_j  \\\\\n  & d(kr,dj) \\cdot \\unicode{x1D7D9}\\{ x_{kr} - x_{dj} \\in (-\\infty, -\\lambda_2] \\} \\cdot (1-A_j)  \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\n## Run the Regression\n\nUsing these 100 features (1 $x_{kr}$ feature, 11 projected-gap-distance features, and 88 segmented distance features), and our response column $V$, we run an ordinary linear regression to obtain a function $\\hat{f}$ which, given the tracking data of all players on the field during a kick return, returns the expected value of the play.\n\nWe train the regression on all kick returns (removing touchbacks) from 2018 and 2019, leaving all kick returns from 2020 as testing data. The out-of-sample rmse is $0.51$, which is fine considering the magnitude of $V$ and how noisy kick returns are.","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.005548,"end_time":"2022-01-05T04:15:27.599239","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-01-05T04:15:27.593691","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"id":"3cc29359"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Algorithm: Choosing the Optimal Run Path for a Kick Returner\n\nThe result of our regression is a function $\\hat f$ which, given the $(x,y,s,dir)$ variables of each player on the field during a given kick return frame, outputs the expected value of this kick return. \n\nTo choose the optimal run path for a kick returner, we use a greedy algorithm. The basic idea is that, given the tracking data of all players on the field during the current frame of a kick return, we choose the kick returner's location for the next frame as the location which maximizes the value of $\\hat{f}$, keeping the variables for all the other players the same. \n\nMore specifically, suppose the kick returner's state at the current frame is given by $(x_{0,kr},y_{0,kr},s_{0,kr},a_{0,kr},dir_{0,kr})$. Let $\\mathcal{C}$ denote the set of candidate kick returner states for the next frame. $\\mathcal{C}$ consists of 16 equidistant points on the circle centered at $(x_{0,kr},y_{0,kr})$, having radius $s_{0,kr} \\cdot \\Delta t$, where $\\Delta t = 0.1$ seconds is the time difference between frames. Moreover, if $(x_{1,kr},y_{1,kr})$ is a kick returner's candidate location for the next frame, then his candidate next direction $dir_{1,kr}$ is given by the angle from $(x_{0,kr},y_{0,kr})$ to $(x_{1,kr},y_{1,kr})$, and his candidate next speed is given by $s_{1,kr} = s_{0,kr} + a_{0,kr}\\cdot \\Delta t.$ Note that his candidate next acceleration $a_{1,kr}$ is irrelevant because acceleration is not used in our features or in $\\hat f$. Moreover, we can't even compute $a_{1,kr}$ because we have no information about the kick returner's jerk (derivative of his acceleration). In symbols, a kick returner's optimal next state is given by\n\n$$(x_{*,kr},y_{*,kr}) := \\text{arg}\\max_{\\mathcal{C}} \\hat{f}(x_{1,kr},y_{1,kr},s_{1,kr},dir_{1,kr}).$$\n\nUsing our optimization framework, we can construct the kick returner's optimal return path during a kick return.

The distance $d_i$ between these 2 points is\n\n$$d_i = \\sqrt{(x_{i1}-x_{i*})^2 + (y_{i1}-y_{i*})^2}.$$\n\nWe define a kick returner's _average deviation from optimal movement_, or _ADOM_, as the distance between the observed and optimal next kick-returner locations averaged over all his kick-return frames,\n\n$$ADOM := \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{\\text{frames } i=1}^{n} d_i. $$\n\nA _lower_ $ADOM$ indicates better kick-return decision making.\n\nFor instance, the $ADOM$ of the example kick return shown above is $0.55$, indicating that the kick returner is on average about a half yard away from optimal movement during that kick return.\n\nAs we used all kick returns from 2018 and 2019 as training data for our regression, this leaves all 2020 kick returns as hold-out testing data. \n\nRather than evaluate every frame of every play, to increase our computational efficiency we found the optimal next kick-returner location for every $10^{th}$ frame of every kick return from 2020. We then computed $ADOM$ for every kick returner in this period, which produced the rankings of the 10 best kick return decision makers, for kick returners recording at least 15 kick returns. Note that a lower _ADOM_ corresponds to better decision making during returns.\n\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1_gVAdZ4l3wCvEdPqzApwELf2FIbM9lWV)\n\nTo understand how _ADOM_ relates to a more familiar metric used to judge kick returns, average return yardage, we plot _ADOM_ vs. avg. return yardage below.\n\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1CKkXoh8kWIdFoK0ZWnX9Q3kzk_htEqrw)\n\nThere is no clear relationship across returners between ADOM and Average Return Yardage. This is not necessarily surprising; ADOM is not directly an outcome-based metric, meaning that it only reflects how close the returner's decisions are to the optimal decisions - ADOM does not tell us anything about the yardage that those decisions earn. So, a lower ADOM does not necessarily directly correspond to higher return yardage. ADOM weighs all decisions equally, so it reflects which players make good decisions **consistently** - not which players make critical good decisions resulting in high yardage gains. Inconsistent players and so-called \"home run hitters\" who take high-variance strategies might have high yardage numbers but a low ADOM.\n\nTo evaluate which players make **critical, high-impact** decisions that result in large yardage gains, we develop another metric.\n\n## *AEBO*\n\nThe _expected value added_, or _EVA_, of moving from $(x_{i0},y_{i0})$ to the observed next location $(x_{i+1,1},y_{i+1,1})$ in the $i^{th}$ frame is \n\n$$EVA_{i,obs} = \\hat f( x_{i+1,1}, y_{i+1,1}) - \\hat f(x_{i0},y_{i0}).$$\n\nSimilarly, the _EVA_ of moving from $(x_{i0},y_{i0})$ to the computed optimal next location $(x_{i+1,*},y_{i+1,*})$ in the $i^{th}$ frame is \n\n$$EVA_{i,*} = \\hat f( x_{i+1,*}, y_{i+1,*}) - \\hat f(x_{i0},y_{i0}).$$\n\nWe define a kick returner's _average EVA below optimal_, or _AEBO_, as the difference in optimal EVA and observed EVA averaged over all his kick-return frames,\n\n$$AEBO := \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{\\text{frames } i=1}^{n} \\big( EVA_{i,*} - EVA_{i,obs} \\big).$$\n\nWe computed $AEBO$ on the same dataset on which we computed _ADOM_, producing another ranking of the 10 best kick return decision makers, for kick returners recording at least 15 kick returns.\n\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1unLj2w3u-IeYeEKHygQakSNBxLyweMuC)\n\nA _lower_ $AEBO$ indicates better **critical** kick-return decision making. AEBO accomplishes this because it evaluates the *difference in predicted outcomes* based on decisions, rather than the difference in the decisions themselves. Therefore, it does not value all decisions equally - decisions are effectively weighted by their importance (as measured by EVA). \n\nAs before, we plot _AEBO_ vs. avg. return yardage to gain insight on our metric.\n\n![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1FvPVxE2RuFD3aCNZL8mcABZ9z3JzcMV5)\n\nThe correlation between AEBO and Average Return Yardage is striking - clearly players with a lower AEBO (and therefore better critical decision making) earn more yards.\n\nThis result, which comes from held out data (not the data our model was trained on), provides evidence that our model and our approach are valid. Our approach led to a metric _AEBO_, which gave us a way to evaluate kick returners and produced a ranking that matched our intuition of what it means to be a good kick returner - highly ranked players have high average  return yardage. Hence we feel validated in our approach. \n\nMoreover, _AEBO_ is blind to the _final_ outcome of a kick return, yet players with a low _AEBO_ are the players with a high avg. return yardage! This is a fantastic insight because it gives us a way of finding **hidden value**. NFL teams want players who produce a high avg. return yardage. Unfortunately, the final outcome of a kick return is very noisy, because players can benefit from an exceptional block or a lucky missed tackle, for instace. _AEBO_ mitigates this noise by aggregating over _all_ of a kick returner's frames, not just his final outcomes. \n\nNFL teams should consider using _AEBO_ as a tool to evaluate a kick returner's value. Players with a low _AEBO_ might be undervalued - they may be due for an increase in yardage sooner rather than later. On the other hand, players with a high _AEBO_ may be overrated - perhaps they're just getting lucky and are due for a regression when their poor decision-making catches up with them. \n\n\n","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.005355,"end_time":"2022-01-05T04:15:27.643413","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-01-05T04:15:27.638058","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"id":"8befb542"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Conclusion\n\nWe devised a novel framework for computing the optimal return path for a kick returner.

During field goal and point after touchdown attempts, the snap is received by the holder, typically 7–8 yards away. During punts, the snap is delivered to the punter from 13–15 yards away. Following a punt snap, the snapper often executes a blocking assignment and then must cover the kick by running downfield and attempting to stop the opposing team's punt returner from advancing the ball in the opposite direction. If the punt goes uncaught, it is the snapper's responsibility to make sure the ball does not enter the end zone or bounce backward resulting in loss of yards. The majority of snappers at the highest levels of competition are specialized, meaning that they uniquely play the position of snapper, or have limited responsibilities elsewhere.  \nThe position of long snapper was not always a solid position. Until about 20 years ago, the position of long snapper would be filled by a random player or lineman who was not getting playing time. The thought to have a roster spot reserved for just a snapper was ridiculous. Over time, people started to realize how important the role was, as one bad snap could lose any game. In the past 20 years, teams have not only trained and recruited true long snappers, but they even offer scholarships because of the importance of the position.  \nOverall, Long Snappers (LS) need to be fast with the ability to accelerate and change directions quickly while also being tall and heavy to block strong Players from the opposite team. Therefore, a ranking among Long Snappers (LS) should consider mainly physical/fitness aspects of their performance.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **What are the relevant attributes a Long Snapper (LS) can be juged by?**\nThe hereby introduced Long Snapper Adjusted Fitness Total (LOAFT) score takes into consideration the following data:\n1. From the Player data:\n    - Height\n    - Weight\n    - Birth Date\n    - Position\n    - NFL-ID\n2. From the Tracking data:\n    - Speed in yards/second\n    - Acceleration in yards/second^2\n    - Distance traveled from prior time point (in yards)\n    \nInformation are filtered in such a way that only Players with the position \"Long Snapper\" are taken into consideration. The NFL-ID is needed to uniquly identify a single Long Snapper (LS).\n\n**Note: Other statistics from Play data or Scouting data is not taken into consideration since statistics/achievements concerning the entire Special Team cannot always be clearly assigned to a single Player, making it hard to keep a ranking objective. This underlines the fact that the LOAFT statistics are meant to specificly probe Long Snappers' Physical Fitness - not their overall behavior or integration into the game. Therefore, LOAFT statistics can help analysts to pick out Long Snappers by their velocity relativ to their height and weight or to find patterns in the way physical attributes influence Agility and Maneuverability, they cannot replace but rather supplement overall statistics.**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **Agenda**\n#### 1.

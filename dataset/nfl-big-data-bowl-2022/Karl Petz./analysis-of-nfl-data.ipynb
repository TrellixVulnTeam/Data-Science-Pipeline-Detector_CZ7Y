The goal of american football is to score as many points and to stop the opposing team from scoring points. There are essentialy 2 ways for scoring in american football. A field goal or a touch down. A touch down which is worth 6 points and enables the scoring team to gain extra points which is called conversion by either scoring another touchdown or a field goal from the 15 yard line. If a field goal is missed no points are given and the other team then starts on offence. Therefore it is integral that the success rate for an attempted field is as high as possible to increase the chance of winning.

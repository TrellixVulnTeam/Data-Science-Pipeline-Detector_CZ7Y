To summarize the use case of this metric, I will paraphrase a concept that we have all heard from coaches when giving praise to defensive players. “He has a nose for the football”, “She is always around the football disrupting the play”, or “They were ‘Johnny on the spot’” are often notable words of praise on players whose job it is to play defense. Their job is to make tackles, get fumble recoveries, assist teammates in the process or otherwise be disruptive by hunting down the football during the play. Ball Proximity Average (BPA) is defined as the average distance a player is away from the football during the relevant events of all “Live Kickoff” plays that only include touchdown, safety, tackle, fumble, and defensive fumble recovery. This statistic can be viewed objectively as a way to judge how close a kickoff coverage special teams player was to the ball on average when there was a “play to be made”. For each relevant event instance, players were awarded a distance value as measured by the differences in their coordinates and the football coordinates using the Euclidean Distance formula aka the Pythagorean Theorem. Over the course of each of the three sample seasons, BPA, tackles, assists, misses, and fumble recoveries were aggregated and compared using simple linear regression and comparative analysis. The resulting StoryBoard presentation was published in Tableau and made public for this competition. See link to the Tableau Dashboard here. [Our Tableau Dashboard](http://public.tableau.com/app/profile/taidje.tang/viz/NFLBigDataBowl2022BallProximityAnalysis/2018_Avg_BPAvs_Avg_TackleRatebyPosition)\n    \n## BPA Metric Use Case\n\nKickoff Coverage is an area of the game we believe we can improve and make more objectively measurable by using BPA when evaluating players. In this analysis, I will propose the idea of using BPA as a simple, yet articulate way to measure the performance of all non-kicking or quarterbacking players while defending against “Live” Kickoff Returns. This idea may also be useful for other phases of the game, however this analysis focuses on analyzing performance, in-game potential, and overall “hustle” while handling kickoff coverage duties.\n\nFirst imagine you are watching a “live” kickoff play where there was no touchback or out-of-bounds kick with the ball being returned or fielded by the receiving team. No matter the result of the play, the distance of the player from the ball is relevant to his performance because it represents one’s ability to make a play on the ball. Just as one can’t make a tackle from 15 yards away from the ball, he is also limited on his ability to recover a fumble or help a teammate who may have missed a tackle. From this perspective, the BPA metric can also be objectively used to judge a player’s “hustle” and “nose for the football”. For example, in the event that a player is beaten on an open field block that led to a touchdown for the receiving team, that player would have their BPA increase accordingly. By the same token, the player that narrowly missed catching the returner trailing the eventual touchdown would have their BPA much less affected than the weak link player who ended the play many yards away. In American football, proximity to the football matters tremendously, especially when there is a play to be made. \n\nThe potential use case and applications of the BPA metric are extensive. At the end of every game, season, or even career, BPA can be used to summarize players’ play making potential and hustle. While the metric doesn’t always translate into success on a play in the form of a tackle, assist, touch, or fumble recovery, it can certainly quantify the potential of a player to make the play. Much like Batting Average in baseball, this rolling average can be viewed against any number of factors such as field conditions, recency, or vs. certain opponents. I can imagine using this stat to analyze the impact of a player who may not show up in the traditional box score because it may be useful by giving credit to players who are “around the football”. In conclusion, the lower a player’s BPA, the closer they are to the football when a play needs to be made. \n\n## Data Preparation and Processing\n\nSince BPA was strictly defined to be applied to only non-kicker and non-quarterback Kickoff Coverage players, the metric needed to be created only using relevant tracking data for relevant play event instances. The process of the cleaning and refining necessary was meticulous and tedious, but essential to the objectivity of the stat. The following conditions were used to determine “relevant” plays:\n\n-specialTeamsPlayType was limited to ‘Kickoff’ only.\n\n-Relevant events on kickoff play events only included ‘tackle’, ‘fumble’, ‘fumble_defense_recovered’, ‘touchdown’, and ‘safety’. These were determined to be the “plays to be made” on kickoff coverage. \n\n-The set only included players on kickoff coverage, excluding players on the receiving team.\n\nOnce relevant plays and qualifying players were selected, many columns in the data set needed to be cleaned and transformed in order to accurately tally play success measurables such as tackle_rate, touch_rate, and fumble_recovery_rate. The details of the data processing are in the source code of this note book in the [Appendix](#Appendix). \n\n## BPA Analysis by Age\n\nWhen examining age as a factor, BPA tends to increase for players over 30 when compared to players in their 20s. Some outliers exist in the over 30 years old segment. This may be a result of the players who are still playing that postion have specialized and excelled which kept them there, as opposed to being cut for a younger player. \n\n## BPA Analysis by Position\n\nWhen examining position as a factor, avg. BPA tends to increase for players who are on offense as opposed to defense. Tackle rates reflect poorer performance as a result. \n\n## BPA Analysis by College\n\nWhen examining College as a factor, we found it difficult to draw insights from the college attended as a factor in BPA, other than perhaps players coming from smaller programs may be \"huslting\" more on plays because they were always underdogs coming into the league. When sorted in ascending order, most players from schools with the lowest average BPA often come from colleges with very few products in the NFL. \n\n## Analytical Conclusions\n\nUnfortunately, due to our limited Kaggle experience and current difficulties presenting our findings in python, we will have to make my analytical conclusions based on my findings in Tableau. After examining BPA vs. performance stats such as tackle rate, touch rate, and fumble recovery rate against such factors as Age, Postion, College, and BPA segment, we have evidence that BPA can be used as a measure for evaluting players in 2 ways: \n\n*We can use BPA to judge when a player has \"lost a step\" or is \"getting older\" as BPA clearly increases as a player enters their 30s. \n\n*We can use BPA to judge how close a player was to the ball during relevant events and measure their proximity as a metric for \"play making potential\" since there exists a broad inverse relationship between kickoff coverage performance and BPA. \n\nWith our findings, we think there is a good use case argument for Ball Proximity Average as a statistic to follow throughout a player's game, season, and even career. \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Appendix","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom datetime import datetime,

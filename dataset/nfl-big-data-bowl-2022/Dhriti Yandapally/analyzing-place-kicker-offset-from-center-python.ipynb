However, kickers typically attempt to place the ball directly between the uprights as that increases the chances of a succesful field goal or extra point. Thus, the place kicker's <b> offset from center </b> can be measured as the absolute difference between where the ball went through the uprights and the center of the uprights. The lower the offset from center, the more accurate the kick.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"ReadData\"></a>\n## Reading Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Loading and installing libraries\n!pip install joypy\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd\nfrom joypy import joyplot\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-28T20:34:39.159576Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-28T20:34:39.160184Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-28T20:34:50.212105Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-28T20:34:39.160064Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-28T20:34:50.210891Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"##reading in non-tracking data\n\n#includes play-by-play info on specific plays\ndf_plays = pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2022/plays.csv\")\n\n#includes background info for players\ndf_players = pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2022/players.csv\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-28T20:35:02.298223Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-28T20:35:02.298585Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-28T20:35:02.470103Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-28T20:35:02.298549Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-28T20:35:02.469105Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_plays.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-28T20:35:04.763381Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-28T20:35:04.763747Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-28T20:35:04.807526Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-28T20:35:04.763716Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-28T20:35:04.806644Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_players.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-28T20:35:07.667256Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-28T20:35:07.667587Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-28T20:35:07.681941Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-28T20:35:07.667556Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-28T20:35:07.680951Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"##Reading tracking data (needs to be done iteratively)\n\n#years of NFL seasons\nseasons = [\"2018\", \"2019\", \"2020\"]\n\n#blank dataframe to store tracking data\ndf_tracking = pd.DataFrame()\n\n#iterating through all seasons\nfor s in seasons:\n    \n    #temperory dataframe used for reading week for given iteration\n    df_trackingTemp = pd.read_csv(\"../input/nfl-big-data-bowl-2022/tracking\"+s+\".csv\")\n    \n    #storing temporary dataframe in full season dataframe\n    df_tracking = df_tracking.append(df_trackingTemp)                         ","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-28T20:35:11.485851Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-28T20:35:11.486687Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-28T20:37:47.305268Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-28T20:35:11.486623Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-28T20:37:47.303428Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_tracking.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-28T20:38:33.323939Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-28T20:38:33.325235Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-28T20:38:33.354978Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-28T20:38:33.32517Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-28T20:38:33.353669Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"CleanData\"></a>\n# Cleaning Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The tracking data is laid out in absolute coordinates and does not flip with the change of possession or end of quarter.

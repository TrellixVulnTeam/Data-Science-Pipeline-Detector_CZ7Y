A great model might get a bronze medal, but when it comes to getting a competitive score, especially in sports prediction problem, taking a calculated risk is worth the reward. The aim is to strategically betting on the outcome of a couple of games\n\n\n---\n# If you use this notebook, do leave an upvote!\n### (Work in Progress) To use this notebook, simply upload your submission file and choose one of the strategies in the config.

This does not work as well on Men's basketball as it does on women's basketball. I wouldn't recommend using it on NCAAM\n\n\n## 2. Better Safe than Sorry\nAlways predicting the probabilities between 0.5 and 0.95. Using this strategy prevents high log loss in case of unseen / black swan event. It can work well on the upcoming 2021 tournaments.\n\n## 3. High Risk High Reward\nUsing the 2 submissions to take a chance on 3 most closely matched games (~0.5 prediction by model). One submission always predicts the team with lower seed and other submission always predict the team with higher seed\n\n## 4. Higher Risk Higher Reward (2019 3rd Place)\nInstead of using the two submissions to flip one game (1 to 0), we can flip 32 most closely matched games (0.64 to 0.36). When the game is unpredictable (model prediction is around 0.5), we can pick the team with lower ID to win with 64% probability. In the second submission, we can predict that the other wins with 64% probability. Assuming that team IDs have nothing to do with winning, this is just random guessing. But if you get lucky, you can win big"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from dataclasses import dataclass \nimport pandas as pd \nimport numpy as np\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"your_submission_file_path = '../input/ncaam-predictions-v2/submission.csv'\nsubmission = pd.read_csv(your_submission_file_path)\nsubmission.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"MODERATE_RISK_MODERATE_REWARD = 'MODERATE_RISK_MODERATE_REWARD'\nBETTER_SAFE_THAN_SORRY = 'BETTER_SAFE_THAN_SORRY'\nHIGH_RISK_HIGH_REWARD = 'HIGH_RISK_HIGH_REWARD'\nHIGHER_RISK_HIGHER_REWARD = 'HIGHER_RISK_HIGHER_REWARD'\n\nSTRATEGY = BETTER_SAFE_THAN_SORRY #Paste your strategy here","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Better Safe than Sorry"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"preds = submission.Pred.values\nCLIP_AT = 0.95\nsafe_preds = np.where(preds > CLIP_AT, CLIP_AT, preds)\nsafe_preds = np.where(preds < 1 - CLIP_AT, 1 - CLIP_AT, preds)\nif STRATEGY == BETTER_SAFE_THAN_SORRY: \n    submission.Pred = safe_preds\n    submission.to_csv('safe_predictions.csv')\nelse: \n    print('I have not yet implemented the rest of the strategies on NCAAM.

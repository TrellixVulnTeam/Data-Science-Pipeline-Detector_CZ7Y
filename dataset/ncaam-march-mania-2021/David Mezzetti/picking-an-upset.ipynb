It's something special when a double digit team beats a highly ranked team, one of the most exciting events in sports.

A very good model may place in the top 10% but often it comes down to luck in terms of placing high in the leaderboard. Taking a calculated risk.\n\nWith the submission deadline coming, one strategy could be to take a chance on a couple different games to attempt to differentiate a submission.

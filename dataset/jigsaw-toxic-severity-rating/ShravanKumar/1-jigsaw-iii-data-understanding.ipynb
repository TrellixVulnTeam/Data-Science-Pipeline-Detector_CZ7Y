The competition target was a binarized version of the toxicity column, which can be easily reconstructed using a >=0.5 threshold.\n\ntoxicity_individual_annotations.csv - The individual rater decisions for toxicity questions.

These worker ids are shared between toxicity_individual_annotations.csv and identity_individual_annotations.csv.\n    \n    toxic - 1 if the worker said the comment was toxic, 0 otherwise.\n    severe_toxic - 1 if the worker said the comment was severely toxic, 0 otherwise. Note that any comment that was considered severely toxic was also considered toxic.\n    identity_attack, insult, obscene, sexual_explicit, threat - Toxicity subtype attributes. 1 if the worker said the comment exhibited each of these traits, 0 otherwise.\n    \nidentity_individual_annoations.csv - The individual rater decisions for identity questions.

Jigsaw I\n\n[Toxic Comment Classification Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge)\n\nIdentify and classify toxic online comments\n\nYou are provided with a large number of Wikipedia comments which have been labeled by human raters for toxic behavior. The types of toxicity are:\n\n* toxic\n* severe_toxic\n* obscene\n* threat\n* insult\n* identity_hate\n\nYou must create a model which predicts a probability of each type of toxicity for each comment.\n\nFiles : \n\n* /kaggle/input/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/sample_submission.csv\n* /kaggle/input/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/test_labels.csv\n* /kaggle/input/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/train.csv\n* /kaggle/input/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/test.csv\n\nFile descriptions\ntrain.csv - the training set, contains comments with their binary labels\ntest.csv - the test set, you must predict the toxicity probabilities for these comments. To deter hand labeling, the test set contains some comments which are not included in scoring.\nsample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format\ntest_labels.csv - labels for the test data; value of -1 indicates it was not used for scoring; \n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df3_train = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/jigsaw-toxic-comment-classification-challenge/train.csv\")\ndf3_train.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-25T15:37:44.359354Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-25T15:37:44.360969Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-25T15:37:46.729042Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-12-25T15:37:44.360869Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-12-25T15:37:46.728141Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df3_train.describe()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-12-25T15:38:45.025555Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-12-25T15:38:45.026891Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-12-25T15:38:45.089298Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-12-25T15:38:45.02684Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-12-25T15:38:45.088588Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n### Ruddit Dataset\n\n#### ruddit-comments\n\nRuddit Comments extracted from Reddit using Python Web Scraper PRAW.

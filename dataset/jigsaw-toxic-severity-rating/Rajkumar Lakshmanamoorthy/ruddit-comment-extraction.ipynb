Rather it provides the post ids and comment ids so that one can extract those comments. This notebook uses **[PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)**, a python library to extract comments from Reddit via **[Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/api)**.\n\nPlease find the Original Paper **[Ruddit: Norms of Offensiveness for English Reddit Comments](https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.210/)**\n\nPlease find the official repo [here](https://github.com/hadarishav/Ruddit)\n\nAcknowledgement:\n\n` @inproceedings{hada-etal-2021-ruddit,\n    title = \"Ruddit: {N}orms of Offensiveness for {E}nglish {R}eddit Comments\",\n    author = \"Hada, Rishav  and\n      Sudhir, Sohi  and\n      Mishra, Pushkar  and\n      Yannakoudakis, Helen  and\n      Mohammad, Saif M.  and\n      Shutova, Ekaterina\",\n    booktitle = \"Proceedings of the 59th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 11th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (Volume 1: Long Papers)\",\n    month = aug,\n    year = \"2021\",\n    address = \"Online\",\n    publisher = \"Association for Computational Linguistics\",\n    url = \"https://aclanthology.org/2021.acl-long.210\",\n    doi = \"10.18653/v1/2021.acl-long.210\",\n    pages = \"2700--2717\",\n    abstract = \"On social media platforms, hateful and offensive language negatively impact the mental well-being of users and the participation of people from diverse backgrounds. Automatic methods to detect offensive language have largely relied on datasets with categorical labels. However, comments can vary in their degree of offensiveness. We create the first dataset of English language Reddit comments that has fine-grained, real-valued scores between -1 (maximally supportive) and 1 (maximally offensive). The dataset was annotated using Best{--}Worst Scaling, a form of comparative annotation that has been shown to alleviate known biases of using rating scales. We show that the method produces highly reliable offensiveness scores. Finally, we evaluate the ability of widely-used neural models to predict offensiveness scores on this new dataset.\",\n}\n`\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![Python Reddit Scraping](https://d1y2qj23ol72q6.cloudfront.net/2021/01/Python-Reddit-Banner-2.jpg)\n> *[Image Source](https://d1y2qj23ol72q6.cloudfront.net/2021/01/Python-Reddit-Banner-2.jpg)*","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Clone the Repo","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# clone from the official repo\n!git clone 'https://github.com/hadarishav/Ruddit.git'","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-12T10:10:02.676598Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-12T10:10:02.676945Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-12T10:10:05.336379Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-12T10:10:02.676857Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-12T10:10:05.33558Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# what files are available?\n!ls ./Ruddit/Dataset/","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-12T10:10:05.338893Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-12T10:10:05.339217Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-12T10:10:06.08832Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-12T10:10:05.339176Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-12T10:10:06.087558Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Install PRAW library and create the environment","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# install Python Reddit API Wrapper\n!pip install praw","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-12T10:10:06.090305Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-12T10:10:06.090688Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-12T10:10:17.084905Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-12T10:10:06.090646Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-12T10:10:17.083791Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# import necessary modules and APIs\nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \nfrom time import time\nimport praw\nfrom tqdm.notebook import tqdm_notebook as tqdm\nfrom kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-12T10:59:13.487476Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-12T10:59:13.488201Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-12T10:59:13.493452Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-12T10:59:13.488149Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-12T10:59:13.492381Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Read data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# read the ruddit data file\nruddit = pd.read_csv('./Ruddit/Dataset/Ruddit.csv')\nprint(ruddit.shape)\nruddit.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-12T10:10:17.15544Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-12T10:10:17.156116Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-12T10:10:17.198079Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-12T10:10:17.156069Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-12T10:10:17.197213Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"`comment_id` is the Ruddit Comment ID, `post_id` is the Ruddit parent Post ID, `offensiveness_score` is the score value calculated by authors of the original paper cited above (target value, in case of model fine-tuning) \n\nWhile reading the `Thread_structure.txt` file (available in the Dataset directory), it can be understood that for a given `post_id`, there are one or more `comment_id`.

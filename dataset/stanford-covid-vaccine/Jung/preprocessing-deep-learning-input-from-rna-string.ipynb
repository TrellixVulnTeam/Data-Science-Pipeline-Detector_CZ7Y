Why bother with RNA properties prediction?\n\nRNA Technology is now a new promising hope in Health Science. In addtion to the global-scaled use of COVID19 mRNA-vaccines from BioNTech/Pfizer and Moderna, RNA drugs also provides [a new hint on how to cure important disease such as cancers](https://jhoonline.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13045-020-00951-w).\n\nSerious learners about RNA should take this [amazing course](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-to-biology-the-secret-of-life-3), or just look at this [cute video](https://youtu.be/JQByjprj_mA) (and the others in this channel) if you don't have much time. \n\nLeading labs including [BioNTech](https://biontech.de/how-we-translate/mrna-therapeutics), [Moderna](https://www.modernatx.com/mrna-technology/mrna-platform-enabling-drug-discovery-development) and [others](https://www.accenttx.com/our-scientific-focus/rmps-and-cancer/) state that RNA-related technology has an important advantage over DNA-technology such that it will not provide a **permanent effects** on a patient, i.e. if we modify our genes in DNA, the modification will permanently embed in the DNA, including any modification mistakes.\n\nIn contrast, injected RNA will do its job i.e. making protiens, and then completely disappeared, without leaving any permanent effects. Proteins made by RNA could prevent some\nimportant diseases such as in the case of mRNA vaccines. Intuitively, Moderna compares DNA as a life \"hardware\" while RNA as a \"software\" which can be safely injected to human body.\n\nTo design RNA drug or vaccine, some properties of RNA must be known. In the past, these properties have to be tested in bio labs which can be time and resource consuming.\nTherefore, it is difficult to conduct experiments in a large scale e.g. millions of RNAs. \n\nDeep learning technology then can help predicting specific properties of millions of RNAs in a flash. Even though, its predictions are not entirely 100% accurate, it can serve as a first filter\nfor biologists to select most promising samples to further make a small-scale intensive case in the next phase.\n\n\n## 1.1 About this Tutorial\nThis interactive tutorial notebook demonstrates how to preprocess RNA data into an input ready to feed into Deep Learning models.\nThe processed data will be similar to the ones provided by [Kaggle's mRNA OpenVaccine competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/stanford-covid-vaccine/overview).\nSo that once you finish processing your own RNA data, you can use any of the [great public codes](https://www.kaggle.com/c/stanford-covid-vaccine/code?competitionId=22111&sortBy=voteCount) \nto make a prediction. We will provide a simplified SOTA top-solution, which will be easily reproducible and adapt to your own work in the near future, so stay tune!!\n\nFigure 1 shows the overall big picture of this notebook. \n\nHere, we assume that the user has a list of \"RNA strings\" as input where an RNA string is a string consisting of only 4 characters 'ACGU'.\nThe true RNA structure of a given string is unknown as can be illustrated in Figure 1 (bottom-left).\nThe user wants to extract this unknown structure and represents it in the format which is ready-to-use on a Deep Learning model, e.g. a neural network.\n\n\nIn this tutorial, this unknown structure will be estimated using various python and bioinformatics libraries. \nTo feed into a deep learning model, the estimated structure will be best represented by \"Graph data\" $G = (X, E)$ where\neach node in the graph corresponding to each character in a string.\n\nNote that this **Graph Representation** generalizes **Sequential Data Representation** so while you can still use well-known\nsequential layers/models such as '1D Convolution', 'Transformers' or 'Recurrent Neural Networks', you can also use a new frontier\nlike 'Graph Neural Networks' which is actually shown effective in this RNA data.\n\n$X$ is a sequence of **node feature vectors**,\nand $E$ is an adjacency matrix specifying linkages for each pair of nodes whether the pair is connected in the true structure.\n\nIn general, each element in an adjacency matrix can be a real number (e.g. specifying a \"probability\" whether a pair is connected).\nMoreover, there can be more than one adjacency matrices (e.g. differently estimated from various libraries). \n\nIn this general setting of having a list of several adjacency matrices, we will shortly call $E$ as a list of **edge features**.\n\n**Acknowledgement** this tutorial is built on amazing works of many kagglers especially [@its7171](https://www.kaggle.com/its7171/how-to-generate-augmentation-data) and [@group16](https://www.kaggle.com/group16/generating-bpps-with-arnie). However, the URLs and packages used in their notebooks are already outdated. This tutorial fix the problems, ensure complete reproducibility using static Kaggle's dataset, as well as providing full detailed explanation with minimum requirements on the input data.\n","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.047093,"end_time":"2022-02-16T04:28:16.548012","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-02-16T04:28:16.500919","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<!-- ![Data preprocessing from an RNA string](https://i.ibb.co/8mkQ1vh/RNA-data-preprocessing.png) -->\n<img src=https://i.ibb.co/8mkQ1vh/RNA-data-preprocessing.png width=\"1024\">\nFigure 1.

Here, we will use Kaggle's OpenVaccine dataset containing 6,000 RNA strings. Note that in OpenVaccine, the dataset already contained some of node and edge features. We will not use them in this tutorial but will show how to extract features even beyond ones in OpenVaccine.\n\n**Node Features.** Each character in an RNA string is represented by its character \"A, C, G or U\" and its loop-type as shown in Figure 1 \"Exterior, Bulge, Stem, Multibranch or Hairpin\". We will represent each character by 1-hot vector $R^4$ and will represent the loop-type vector in $R^6$ since there are 6 possible loop types. \n\nNote that RNA structure can be very complex and have a wide variety as shown in Figure 2.\n\n![](https://i.ibb.co/swD1DBF/rna-folding-examples.png)\nFigure 2. RNA can have a variety of structure due to folding.\n\nTherefore, due to complexity of the RNA folding structure, exact loop-type property is unknown (already mentioned in Figure 1), the `CapR` library we used can estimate loop-type probability. Therefore, it will return a probability vector in $R^6$.\n\nTherefore, by concatenating the two vectors, our node features will lies in $R^{10}$. Note that it's certainly possible that to also employ other libraries to extract more node features so that our node-feature vector lies in a higher dimensional than $R^{10}$.\n\n\n**Edge Features.** Similar to loop-type features, exact link between a pair of nodes is unknown. Therefore, **\"base-pair probabilities matrix (bpps)\"** is extracted instead. Suppose that an RNA string is length of $N$, bpps then is in $R^{N \\times N}$.\n\nThis tutorial show how to extract edge features using bpps libraries such as `vienna`, `contrafold` and `rnastructure`. From bpps of these libraries, we can also get \"most probable\" structure, which can also be further extracted as either node or edge feature.\n\nAfter the node and edge features are extracted, they can be input directly to deep learning models as shown in Figure 3. See The [RNA Deep Learning notebook tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/ratthachat/tutorial-pretrained-sota-deeprna-model-made-easy) for how to apply pretrained SOTA RNA model into general RNA prediction problem.\n\n<img src=https://i.ibb.co/r3WB24R/RNA-feature-and-model.png width=\"750\">\nFigure 3.

Advanced Node-Feature Extraction\n\nWe are done, but what else? We can actually go beyond to explore some feature engineering like SOTA [models](https://www.kaggle.com/group16/covid-19-mrna-4th-place-solution), which also was inspried by [this](https://www.kaggle.com/its7171/gru-lstm-with-feature-engineering-and-augmentation) and this [notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/its7171/dangerous-features). Yes, SOTA models were those who got gold medals in the very-intense OpenVaccine competition!\n\nAdvanced node features that we are going to extract further in this section are\n\n* The ratio of Dot-Bracket prediction `'(', '.',` and `')'` predicted by 3 packages (`vienna`, `contrafold` and `rnastructure`) -- instead of depending only on one package like we did in previous section\n* Some of bpps for each base\n* Maximum probability with respect to bpps for each base\n* Number of non-zeros on bpps for each base\n* Codon's (triplet) position for each base which is simply 012012012012... for every RNA string.\n* (Optional: Problem-specific, but conceptually applicatble) Sample-weight which is standard in model fitting. In OpenVaccine problem, we could use \"signal-to-noise\" ratio as sample weight whereas in other contexts, you can consult expert for appropriate specification.\n* (Optional: Problem-specific) Error-bar of each labels (problem specific and is provided in OpenVaccine). We could use this feature for advanced \"sample_weight\" where the weights are different for each base/label (whereas the standard sample_weight, one weight is used for all bases/labels).  This feature set may not obtainable from other problems, so we can switch on or off\n\nThe last-two optional features can be further boosted the prediction performance of a deep learning model. For example, [RNA Deep Learning notebook tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/ratthachat/tutorial-pretrained-sota-deeprna-model-made-easy) will employ the error-bar features.","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.125736,"end_time":"2022-02-16T06:20:50.958853","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-02-16T06:20:50.833117","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# we will save these advanced node features separated from basic node features, so that users can choose either of them\nADV_NODE_DIR = '/kaggle/working/advanced_node_features/'\nos.mkdir(ADV_NODE_DIR) ","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.133447,"end_time":"2022-02-16T06:20:51.218882","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-02-16T06:20:51.085435","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-18T06:35:30.769592Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-18T06:35:30.77026Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-18T06:35:30.778496Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-18T06:35:30.770207Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-18T06:35:30.776379Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"rna_id_list = structure_df.id.unique()\nstructure_df.head(2)","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.149788,"end_time":"2022-02-16T06:20:51.493252","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-02-16T06:20:51.343464","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-18T06:35:30.780686Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-18T06:35:30.781571Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-18T06:35:30.822641Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-18T06:35:30.781499Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-18T06:35:30.820518Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Choose whether to extract \"sample_weight\" and/or \"error_bar\" features here\nSAMPLE_WEIGHT_FEAT = False #

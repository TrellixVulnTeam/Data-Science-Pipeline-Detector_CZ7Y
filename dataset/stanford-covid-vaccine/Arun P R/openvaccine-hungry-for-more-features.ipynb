I will not be posting any more notebooks on OpenVaccine till competition end as we are nearing deadlines. So kindly bear with me for one more time."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## No Code Notebook\nThis is a no code notebook. This notebook is meant to give ideas to explore for all the data wizards out there hungry for new features. Exploit the ones that work for you and eliminate the weeds and use at your own risk."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## OpenVaccine Starter Kit:\n\nThis notebook along with the following notebooks form an ideal starter kit for OpenVaccine. The material in this notebook builds upon my [Literature Survey](https://www.kaggle.com/arunprathap/openvaccine-literature-survey). Be sure to check it out if you need some more info regarding the presented features. The features are presented in no particular order of importance. You can try out if they perform well using my notebook [Feature Importance](https://www.kaggle.com/arunprathap/openvaccine-feature-correlation-importance). For EDA, I would recommend my [JSON to CSV](https://www.kaggle.com/arunprathap/openvaccine-json-dataset-to-csv-dataset) notebook to convert competition data to CSV format so that you can then directly apply common EDA methods to the data. Also check out my [flatten json data](https://www.kaggle.com/arunprathap/openvaccine-flatten-json-data) notebook on an alternate way to convert json data to pandas dataframe. Don't forget to check out the notebooks by [tito](https://www.kaggle.com/its7171/gru-lstm-with-feature-engineering-and-augmentation), [Tucker Arrants](https://www.kaggle.com/tuckerarrants/openvaccine-gru-lstm), [xhlulu](https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu/openvaccine-simple-gru-model) for tensorflow based models. Last but not the least, check out my tensorflow and keras based [Transformer Encoder Starter](https://www.kaggle.com/arunprathap/transformer-encoder-implementation) to try out these features for real. I would also suggest [Pytorch](https://www.kaggle.com/c/stanford-covid-vaccine/discussion/183518) starter if you are not in to tensorflow. I believe together these form a complete starter kit for OpenVaccine competition."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Also checkout other recent notebooks covering the features: [Dangerous Features](https://www.kaggle.com/its7171/dangerous-features) and [EDA & Additional Features](https://www.kaggle.com/allohvk/eda-some-additional-features-rc-pair-distance). I will assume that myself as well as you have not gone through those, so we both don't know what is in there."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Feature 1\n\nAs provided in the dataset : Sequence\n\nRationale : The specific base determines the predictions for sure as this is the one thing in the dataset that is not a predicted quantity. This is my ground fact (corresponding to my ground truth values - beware more biased facts are coming...). Consider adding adjacent base pair also if you are not using a sequence based model."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Feature 2\n\nAs provided in the dataset :BBPS\n\nDerived Features:Various\n\nRationale: This looks good. Ready to feed in to a convolutional/image decoder. But is it all? We have seen notebooks exploiting this in all imaginable ways. I personally use 1-sum(bbps), some notebooks use sum(bbps), max(bbps), count(bbps>0), and what not. I even tried with more dangerous ones like avg(bbps)... Which one of these to go for. [Dangerous Features](https://www.kaggle.com/its7171/dangerous-features) linked above may show you the way out of this. Sorry, I forgot that we didn't read that in the first place. Sorry for cheating."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Feature 3\n\nAs provided in the dataset :Predicted Loop Type\n\nRationale: Though this is a prediction, it gives some means of differentiating between unpaired bases (Note that all paired bases are of type S, if you haven't noticed that earlier)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Feature 4\n\nAs provided in the dataset:Structure\n\nRationale: Include this only if you want redundancy in you training data. Why? All (,) in structure are of type S in Predicted Loop Type. So correlation between Predicted loop type S and structure is -1. I think you might have realised where I am going....else, do a little google search of you own why that matters."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Feature 5\n\nDerived Feature:Pair distance (from structure)\n\nRationale: match ( and ) in structure to get pair positions, get the absolute difference to get this feature. But be sure to checkout [Dangerous Features](https://www.kaggle.com/its7171/dangerous-features) before you decide to include this. Sorry for cheating again."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Feature 6\n\nDerived Feature:Pair distance from stem ends (from structure)\n\nRationale: Pairs in the middle of the stem are less reactive compared to those in the ends. How to compute this? It was a bit tricky. You match all pairs as in previous features. Now find pairs that are part of the same stem (beware that there can be multiple stems in a sequence). One trick I applied is using a queue to match (some public notebooks have done this) and a stem is complete when my queue is empty. Thus find the stems. Then take min of relative position from either end for each pair of the stem and you get the feature."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Feature 7\n\nDerived Feature:Pair type(from structure and sequence)\n\nRationale: Interactions with adjacent pair determine my stability. If you are not using some sequence network, consider adding adjacent pair types also to the feature set."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Feature 8\n\nDerived Feature:Adjacent Pair type(see above feature for details)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Feature 9\n\nDerived Feature:Adjacent Base Type (see feature 1 for details)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Feature 10\n\nDerived Feature:Distance to nearest paired base\n\nRationale:Still thinking of one"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Feature 11\n\nDerived Feature:Position in the sequence (from sequence)\n\nRationale:Some notebooks report positive impact. But be careful of using this, as the performance of this feature depends on the type of model you are using."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Feature 12\n\nDerived Feature: Distance to nearest base for each type in loop type\n\nRationale:Nothing, just in case you want to try out more dangerous, unexplainable features to prevent overfitting probably."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Feature 13\n\nDerived Feature:Distance to nearest unpaired base\n\nRationale: If I can use distance to nearest paired base, then distance to nearest unpaired base may also work. After all its just a feature with two more letters."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Conclusion\n\nWhy stop at 13? Quoting Wikipedia, \"Some believe this is unlucky because one of those thirteen, Judas Iscariot, was the betrayer of Jesus Christ.\" So we may find minimum one betrayer here and more betrayers will hurt more. The LB scores are bleeding already and I have improved(?) my rank from 3 to 103 in the past one week trying out these features (not necessarily). So I will not give you any more info. I am just another selfish guy round the corner of your street after all."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Endnote\n\nIf you have more interesting features to share, post it in comments section.

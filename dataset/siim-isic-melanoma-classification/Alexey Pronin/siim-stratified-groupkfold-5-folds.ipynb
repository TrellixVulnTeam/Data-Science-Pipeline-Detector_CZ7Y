On one hand, we have a very imbalanced dataset, so some sort of stratification seems to be in order here. On the other hand, we know that some of the patients present in the dataset are represented by multiple images and it is probably a good idea not to mix images corresponding to the same `patient_id` in our training and validation sets. The latter can be achieved by using sklearn Group K-Fold split. Unfortunately, sklearn does not have an implementation of Stratified Group K-Folds, so we have to make one from scratch. Fortunately, one such implementation of Stratified Group K-Folds was already developed in the PetFinder competition (see the \"Acknowledgement\" section), so we can just take it and use it here. This is what we do in this notebook.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Setting the number of folds\n\nTo illustrate the main idea we will be using an example of 5 folds.

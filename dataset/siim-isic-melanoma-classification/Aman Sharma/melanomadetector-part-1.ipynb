Melanomas typically occur in the skin but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines or eyes.\nAbout 25% of melanomas develop from moles. Changes in a mole that can indicate melanoma include an increase in size, irregular edges, change in color, itchiness or skin breakdown.\n\nThe primary cause of melanoma is ultraviolet light (UV) exposure in those with low levels of the skin pigment melanin. The UV light may be from the sun or other sources, such as tanning devices. Those with many moles, a history of affected family members and poor immune function are at greater risk. A number of rare genetic conditions such as xeroderma pigmentosum also increase the risk.Diagnosis is by biopsy and analysis of any skin lesion that has signs of being potentially cancerous.\nâ€” Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanoma#:~:text=Melanoma%2C%20also%20known%20as%20malignant,or%20eye%20(uveal%20melanoma).)\n\nAlso check out [this page on SkinCancer.org](https://www.skincancer.org/skin-cancer-information/melanoma/) to know more about melanoma.\n***\n\nMelanoma is one of the most aggressive forms of skin cancer. Hence, a highly efficient model capable of early detection of melanoma can prove to be a life saviour.\n\n***","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Importing Project Dependencies\n---\n\nThis notebook will be dedicated to the EDA of the training data.

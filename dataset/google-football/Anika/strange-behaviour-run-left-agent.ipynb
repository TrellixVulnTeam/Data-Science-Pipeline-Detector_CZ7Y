In this notebook I let two run_left agents play against eachother. One run_left agent runs towards his own goal and disappears from the field. The other player also a run_left agent runs towards the ball, gets the ball, turns around and puts the ball in his own goal!?? At this moment I cannot explain its behavior, maybe someone else has an explanation.\n\n[Football](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football) is a game played with two teams of eleven players, including one goalkeeper. The object of the game is to outscore the opposition by moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing goal. The team with the higher number of goals wins the game. The game is played on a retangular field with a length between 100 and 110 meters and a width between 64 and 75 meters.\n\nBefore we can play football we need to install required tools:"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Install:\n# Kaggle environments.\n!git clone https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-environments.git\n!cd kaggle-environments && pip install .\n\n# GFootball environment.\n!apt-get update -y\n!apt-get install -y libsdl2-gfx-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev\n\n# Make sure that the Branch in git clone and in wget call matches !!\n!git clone -b v2.3 https://github.com/google-research/football.git\n!mkdir -p football/third_party/gfootball_engine/lib\n\n!wget https://storage.googleapis.com/gfootball/prebuilt_gameplayfootball_v2.3.so -O football/third_party/gfootball_engine/lib/prebuilt_gameplayfootball.so\n!cd football && GFOOTBALL_USE_PREBUILT_SO=1 pip3 install .","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Exploring the GFootball environment\n\nThe next step is setting up the environment.

# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import tensorflow as tf

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
print(os.listdir("../input"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

# This is similar to the implementation used in 
# https://www.kaggle.com/iezepov/fast-iou-scoring-metric-in-pytorch-and-numpy
# except that:
# we handle the empty mask case correctly.
# We don't need a smoothing constant.
# iou is computed image per image.

Just like pictionary.\nIn 2017, the Magenta team at Google Research took that idea a step further by using this labeled dataset to train the [Sketch-RNN](https://magenta.tensorflow.org/assets/sketch_rnn_demo/index.html) model, to try to predict what the player was drawing, in real time, instead of requiring a second player to do the guessing. The game is [available online,](https://quickdraw.withgoogle.com) and has now collected over 1 billion hand-drawn doodles!"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"63905e199f979fa5d3d4087bc7d0880ae9f3f5b1"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# &#128220; Overview Of Quick Draw DataSet\nThe team has open sourced this data, and in a variety of formats.

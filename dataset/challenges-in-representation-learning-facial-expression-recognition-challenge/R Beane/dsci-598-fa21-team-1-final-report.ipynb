Technologies adapt to human needs, and artificial intelligence makes this adaptation possible between technology and human beings. \n\nThere are AI techniques very present in algorithms for the recognition of human expressions. When human beings try to communicate with other people, a very high percentage is represented by communication, not verbal. Many studies show that facial expressions have a link with human emotions. The capacity of human beings to detect and identify these emotions makes it possible for us to understand each other. The main objective of this part of artificial intelligence is to use learning techniques so that the machine can identify these emotions.\n\nFacial expression recognition is a part of intelligence whose main objective is to recognize primary affective expression forms on people's faces. But can we offer Machine learning and Deep learning techniques to identify these efficient enough facial expressions? \n\nIn this project, we will apply the mechanisms these technologies offer us to recognize feelings or emotions in people. We will first process and obtain the information we want from a database to do this. This database is a series of pixels from images of people showing different feelings.

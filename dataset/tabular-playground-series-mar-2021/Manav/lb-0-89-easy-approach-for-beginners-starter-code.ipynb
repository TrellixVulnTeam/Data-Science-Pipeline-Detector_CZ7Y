{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Approach:-\nMy advice to beginners will be to follow the following workflow for approaching any tabular data for competition:-  \n1. Read the Problem Statement and understand the requirements carefull.\n2. READ THE PROBLEM STATEMENT AND REQUIREMENTS AGAIN.\n3. Look carefully at the Data and do EDA (It will help largely during feature engineering and Inference). It is worth the time.\n4. Decide the poroblem category (Classification/Regression).\n5. Spit data into Kfolds before doing Feature engineering. Because it's very easy to leak data/contaminate the validation set during Feature Engineering. Then the validation set is no longer representative of real data.\n6. Build Basic model and record the performance.\n7. Try to improve the performance by Feature engineering, better encoding, synthetic feature creation etc.\n8. Do feature selection to only use the important/relevant features.\n9. If that saturates or starts to drop, go back and try using other models and see whichone works better.\n10. Tune the hyperparameters for the models which seem to work good as per your observations.\n11. Select some of the best models from previous step and do an ensemble/stacking-blending.\n12. Submit to the leaderboard and gaze the difference in CV and LB. If it is huge, then most likely there was some overfitting and leakage across folds. Try to identify and rectify the same.\n13. When done, resubmit and you should see a close result.\n14. Not satisfied with result/Trying to get better rank? Head over to the Discussion Forum and read through interesting discussions and see what others are trying to do. If happy, implement them and gradually start improving your scores and skills.\n\n**Happy Kaggling!**\n\n# Why this Competition?\nThis competition provides an unique oppertunity for Data Science begiiners to participate in a Hackathon style challenge for Data Science. It also provides the unique oppertunities for beginners to get their hands dirty and indulge is practical application of ML and do one of the basic tasks machine learning algorithms are capable of doing:- **Classification**.  \n\nThis competition has the right mix to Catergorical and Numerical features we might expect in a practical problem and this helps us know how to leverage both of thhem in conjugation for a Classification task.\n\n# Problem Statement\nThe goal of this competition is to provide a fun, and approachable for anyone, tabular dataset. These competition will be great for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and a Featured competition.  \n\nThe dataset used for this competition is synthetic but based on a real dataset and generated using a CTGAN. The original dataset deals with predicting the amount of an insurance claim. Although the features are anonymized, they have properties relating to real-world features.  \n\nSo we are sort of dealing with a variation of actual real-world data and here as Data Scientists are expected to predict the Binary Classification based on these features.\n\n## Data Description:-\nWe have 19 Categorical Features and 11 Continuous Features in the data.\n\n## Expected Outcome:-\n* Build a model to predict the probability of binary class given the information above.\n* Grading Metric: **ROC_AUC_SCORE**\n\n## Problem Category:-\nFrom the data and objective its is evident that this is a **Binary Classification Problem** in the **Tabular Data** format.\n\nSo without further ado, let's now start with some basic imports to take us through this journey:-"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Asthetics\nimport warnings\nimport sklearn.exceptions\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore', category=DeprecationWarning)\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore', category=FutureWarning)\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\", category=sklearn.exceptions.UndefinedMetricWarning)\n\n# General\nimport pandas as pd\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\nimport numpy as np\nimport os\nfrom scipy.optimize import fmin as scip_fmin\n\n# Visialisation\nimport matplotlib as mpl\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set(style=\"whitegrid\")\n\n# Machine Learning\n\n# Utils\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedKFold, cross_validate\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score, train_test_split, KFold\nfrom sklearn import preprocessing\nimport category_encoders as ce\n\n#Feature Selection\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import chi2, f_classif, f_regression\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import mutual_info_classif, mutual_info_regression\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, SelectPercentile, VarianceThreshold\n# Models\nimport xgboost as xgb\n\n#Metrics\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data_dir = '../input/tabular-playground-series-mar-2021'\n\ntrain_file_path = os.path.join(data_dir, 'train.csv')\ntest_file_path = os.path.join(data_dir, 'test.csv')\nsample_sub_file_path = os.path.join(data_dir, 'sample_submission.csv')\n\nprint(f'Train file: {train_file_path}')\nprint(f'Train file: {test_file_path}')\nprint(f'Train file: {sample_sub_file_path}')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"RANDOM_SEED = 42","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def seed_everything(seed=RANDOM_SEED):\n    os.environ['PYTHONHASHSEED'] = str(seed)\n    np.random.seed(seed)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"seed_everything()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# EDA\nLet's have a basic look around the data we have at hand first"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df = pd.read_csv(train_file_path)\ntest_df = pd.read_csv(test_file_path)\nsub_df = pd.read_csv(sample_sub_file_path)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's see what columns we have in the training data."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df.sample(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df.columns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The naming scheme makes it obvious which column has what datatype."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df.describe().T","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can see that all of the continuous features are almost on a similar scale of magnitude.

"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## What is KNN? \n\nKNN stands for K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm. It belongs to a subclass of machine learning algorithms known as \"instance-based learning\".\nIn instance-based algorithms, no real \"learning\" takes place during the training phase. But rather, the instances are just stored in a suitable format. During the testing phase, the new unseen data point is compared with the stored training data and a result is generated, based on some similarity metric.\n\n![](http://res.cloudinary.com/dyd911kmh/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto:best/v1531424125/KNN_final1_ibdm8a.png)\n\nIn KNN, we compare each new test data with all the training data and fetch the top-K closest data points. We then check the classes of these top-K neighbours and return the majority label as the prediction for the test data.  The above visual gives us a good idea of how KNN works. \n\nIn this notebook, we store each tweet as a vector and then use **cosine similarity** for calculating the distance between vectors. \n\nImage Source: [Datacamp](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/287425/why-do-you-need-to-scale-data-in-knn)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## What is Approximate KNN?\n\nApproximate KNN is a variation of KNN that seeks to limit the number of training samples that each new test point is compared with before returning a result. As you can imagine, if we had a set of 1 Million training samples, then for each new test data point, we would have to compute the cosine similarity with 1M training samples, to find the top-K closest labels. This can be computationally expensive. \n\n\n### Algorithm  \n1. Randomly initialize a set of hyperplanes in the same vector space as the vectors \n2.

To accomplish this, we calculate the hash as follows:\n\n##### Consider the set of random hyperplanes given by their normal vectors \"P\" and vector \"v\" \n#### Sign(P)\n1. Sign(p,v) = 1, if v lies on or in front of the plane p, 0 otherwise\n2. The position of v with respect to p is given by the sign of their dot product.\n3. If the dot product is 0, v lies on the plane described by normal p, return 1 \n4. If the dot product is positive, v lies in the direction of the normal p, return 1\n5. If the dot product is negative, v lies in the opposite side of the normal p, return 0  \n\n#### Calculate Hash\n1. For each p in P, calculate Sign(p,v)\n2. Step 2 yields an array of 0's and 1's with the length = number of planes \n3. Interpret this array as a binary number and convert to decimal. \n4. Return this decimal as the hash value for v with respect to set of planes P\n\nFor example, if we have 5 random planes and the vector v lies in front of plane 1, 3, 4, on plane 5 and behind plane 2, we get the array [1,0,1,1,1].\n\n![](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?hash%3D2%5E4%20*%201%20&plus;%202%5E3%20*0%20&plus;%202%5E2%20*1%20&plus;%202%5E1%20*%201%20&plus;%202%5E0%20*%201%20%3D%2023)\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def get_sign(p, v):\n    # get the sign of vector v with respect to normal p \n    dot_product = np.dot(p, v)\n    sign = np.sign(dot_product)\n    sign = 1 if sign >= 0 else 0\n    return sign\n\ndef get_multi_planar_hashes(planes, v):\n    # calculate the hash of v with respect to set of planes\n    h = [get_sign(plane, v) for plane in planes]    \n    hash_value = sum([2**i * x for i, x in enumerate(h)])\n    return hash_value\n\ndef build_hash_table(corpus, planes):\n    # build a hashtable and assign each training data point to a hash value\n    hash_table = defaultdict(list)\n    for c, vec in corpus.items():\n        hash_value = get_multi_planar_hashes(planes, vec)\n        hash_table[hash_value].append(c)\n    return hash_table\n\ndef get_classmates(vec, planes, hash_table, n=None):\n    # return the IDS of the vectors that have the same hash as v\n    hash_val = get_multi_planar_hashes(planes, vec)\n    idx = hash_table.get(hash_val) \n    neighbor_idx = idx if idx is not None else []\n    if n is not None:\n        neighbor_idx = neighbor_idx[:n]\n    return neighbor_idx\n\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Challenge 2\n\nWhat if there are not enough samples per subspace? This can happen when the random planes split the vector space in such a way that a new test sample does not have any other train samples that have the same hash. \n\nTo overcome this and also make the algorithm more robust, we initialize multiple sets of random hyperplanes and find out the neighbours for the vector v in each of the subspaces that it resides in (one subspace per set). We then use the combined set of training samples with the same hash as v in each of these subspaces as the neighbours of v. \n\n\nFor example, if we have the set of planes P1, P2, P3. \nFor each P, we calculate the hash table and find the neighbours of v with respect to P. \n\nConsider, we get the following neighbors for v:\n* P1 -> [A, B , D , E]\n* P2 -> [C, D, F]\n* P3 -> [D, E , F, G] \n\nThen the set of neighbours for v will be [A, B, C, D, E, F, G]. \n\nThere is still chance that we might end with no neighbours, meaning all the random sets of hyperplanes ended up isolating v from the rest. This would most likely be indicative of an outlier, rare word or a typo. Provided that our training data is large enough and is a good representation of real data, this would be quite unlikely. But yet, we need to be prepared for it.

Conclusion\nTo wrap things up, let's go over our key takeaways from this notebook:\n\n1. Using tweet-preprocessor and spaCy to clean up textual data \n2. Using Pre-trained word embeddings to save time and effort \n3. Understand what KNN is and how to implement it from scratch \n4. Understand what is Approximate KNN and how it differs from KNN \n5. Understand Locality Sensitive Hashing \n6. Perform Cross-Validation to get reliable results \n7. Perform Grid Search to get the optimum hyperparameters\n\nWhile the impact of these results may not be evident with this small dataset, it scales quite well to larger data, resulting in fast predictions. In the end, the choice of one over the other would ultimately boil down to the use-case in which you wish to apply it. Different applications value the trade-off between speed and accuracy quite differently. So a comparative study often helps to get a better idea of the available options. \n\n\n\n# 7. Future Work \nThroughout this notebook, we applied only a few simple preprocessing steps since achieving a top score was not the focus of this notebook. Some of the ways you could expand on this model to generate better results are: \n\n1. There is a strong signal present in the \"keywords\" column of the dataset. Find some way to include this information in the document embeddings. \n2. Use custom word embeddings (using Keras Embedding Layers) so that we do not lose data \n3. Scale the word vectors by their corresponding TF-IDF values to better represent important words  \n4. Use sentence transformations using models that can capture contextual information. Simple word embeddings do not. \n\n*This was my second ever notebook on Kaggle and I worked hard on it, so thanks for stopping to give it a read! I'm always trying to improve myself so I would love your hear your feedback and criticism on my work so please feel free to leave some comments below.

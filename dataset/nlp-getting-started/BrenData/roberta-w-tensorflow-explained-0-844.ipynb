These are the top two links below.

This tokenization method can be thought of as three steps.\n\n- Text Normalization\n    - The first part of the tokenizer converts the text to lowercase (given that we are using the uncased version of roBERTa), converts whitespace to spaces, and strips out accent markers.\n    ```\n    \"Alex Pättason's, \"  -> \"alex pattason's,\"\n    ```\n    <br></br>\n- Punctuation splitting\n    - This next step adds spaces on each side of all \"punctuation\". Note that this includes any non-letter/number/space ASCII characters (ie including \\$, \\@). See more of this in the Docs. \n    ```\n    \"Alex Pättason's, \"  -> \"alex pattason ' s ,\"\n    ```\n    <br></br>\n- WordPiece tokenization\n    - This step applies what is called whitespace tokenization to the output of the process above, and apply's WordPiece tokenization to each word separately. See the example below.\n    ```\n    \"Alex Pättason's, \"  -> \"alex pat ##ta ##son ' s ,\"\n    ```\n   \n### tags\nThe next part of the function reduces the length of the text by the max_length that we have specified and adds [CLS] and [SEP] tags to the end of the array. The [CLS] tag is short for classification and indicates the start of the sentence. Similarly, the [SEP] tag indicates the end of the sentence.\n\n### convert_tokens_to_ids + pad_masks\n\nWe then use the tokenizer method to replace the string representation of words with integers. We also create the input mask (AKA pad_masks), and the segment id's. Note that we are not fulfilling the segment_ids full benefits below as we are only passing an array of zeros. More on the tokens, pad_masks, and segment_ids further in the notebook.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def bert_encode(texts, tokenizer, max_len=512):\n    all_tokens = []\n    all_masks = []\n    all_segments = []\n    \n    for text in texts:\n        text = tokenizer.tokenize(text)\n            \n        text = text[:max_len-2]\n        input_sequence = [\"[CLS]\"] + text + [\"[SEP]\"]\n        pad_len = max_len - len(input_sequence)\n        \n        tokens = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(input_sequence)\n        tokens += [0] * pad_len\n        pad_masks = [1] * len(input_sequence) + [0] * pad_len\n        segment_ids = [0] * max_len\n        \n        all_tokens.append(tokens)\n        all_masks.append(pad_masks)\n        all_segments.append(segment_ids)\n    \n    return np.array(all_tokens), np.array(all_masks), np.array(all_segments)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-22T04:24:01.55526Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-22T04:24:01.555982Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-22T04:24:01.563531Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-22T04:24:01.555943Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-22T04:24:01.56283Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## <center>build_model function</center>\n\nThe first three components of the function are basically preprocessing plain text inputs into the input format expected by the roBERTa model.\n\n### input_word_ids\n- Basically maps each word to its token id.

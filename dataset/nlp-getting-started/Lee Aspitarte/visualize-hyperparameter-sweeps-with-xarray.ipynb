The xarray package builds upon pandas to work with and quickly analyze datasets with an arbitrary number of dimensions. We can use this to understand the effect of each hyperparameter into our model.\n\nI will keep the actual NLP methods used in this notebook to a basic gridsearchCV using a standard sklearn pipeline. The original contribution of the notebook is a conversion of of the gridsearchCV results to an xarray dataset, and an overview of how to use the xarray package to visualize the results. If you are familiar with doing a gridsearch with sklearn you should skip to that part.

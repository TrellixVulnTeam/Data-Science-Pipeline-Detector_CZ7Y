The aim of this notebook is not to only share my solution of the NLP Disaster Prediction problem. I also want to show all the results that I got when I tried to improve the model.\n\nYou will se that all my tries were not better than the basic BERT and that's OK. We must remember that we are talking about Data **Science** and the \"Science\" part of the name is also composed by misleading results that can be reported to help in further studies :).\n\nSo, this guide is presented in the form of a really basic tutorial, as I usually like to do. It's also an opportunity to present the basic concepts of NLP and Transfer Learning to people who want to learn or review these concepts. So, let's start. But, before...\n\n**An Important Acknowledgement to xhlulu:** [His notebook was really, REALLY useful for me](https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu/disaster-nlp-keras-bert-using-tfhub) - In his notebook, the minimal BERT model is presented and he shows that it's possible to get an excellent result by using the original Google's Article BERT model, with the same parameters.\n\nSo, this notebook is composed by $5$ steps:\n1. I show (again) the basic BERT model with a small guide to the concept of transfer learning and natural language processing, following the guideline proposed by xhulu.\n2.

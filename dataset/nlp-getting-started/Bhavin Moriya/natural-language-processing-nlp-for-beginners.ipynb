Count how many times does a word occur in each message (Known as term frequency)\n> 2. Weigh the counts, so that frequent tokens get lower weight (inverse document frequency)\n> 3. Normalize the vectors to unit length, to abstract from the original text length (L2 norm)\n\n> Let's begin the first step:\n\n> Each vector will have as many dimensions as there are unique words in the SMS corpus.

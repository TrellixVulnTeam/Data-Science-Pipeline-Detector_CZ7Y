{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Disaster tweets with RoBERTa"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this notebook we tackle the [disaster tweets](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started) Kaggle competition using ðŸ¤— Huggingface's transformers. Given a tweet, the task is to predict whether it is about a disaster or not. We will leverage an implementation of RoBERTa to solve this task, a language model based on the transformer architecture.\n\nThe challenge is to predict if a tweet refers to an ocurring disaster or if it is about something else. Language is full of figuritave expressions, so it is not straightforward to come up with a rule to classify text as belonging to one or other category that works every time. Even for a human, a message can be difficult to interpret without the appropriate context, which can lead to, sometimes funny, misunderstandings.\n\nAs this is a binary classification task, in principle, any type of classifier can be used, such as logistic regression, SVM, random forest and feed-forward neural networks. These methods make use of the bag of words (BOW) approach to create numerical features, where the order of the words in the text and ther relations are ignored. However, language is a sequential phenomenon and words in a sentence have complex relations between them. More sophisticated language models must be used to capture these relations and extract meaningful information from textual data. The present analysis makes use of RoBERTa, a type of transformer language model put forward by [Facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/roberta-an-optimized-method-for-pretraining-self-supervised-nlp-systems/). RoBERTa is a version of BERT which has been trained on a larger corpus for a longer time to achieve better performance in NLU (natural language understanding) tasks. BERT, in turn, is a transformer model originally proposed by [Google Research](https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/11/open-sourcing-bert-state-of-art-pre.html). A short technical introduction is in order now before we start the analysis.\n\nA [transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) is a type of artificial neural network that consists of an encoder and a decoder, these are processing blocks that are composed of 'attention' layers. In this context, 'attention' can be thought of as a mechanism to relate inputs and outputs through time. The encoder constructs a high-dimensional numerical representation of textual data. In this form, documents are converted into numeric tensors. The decoder produces an output which depends on both the information from the encoder and on all the previous outputs of the decoder. An example of this type of architecture is [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805v2) (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), a highly-complex model composed of stacks of bi-directional transformers and trained on the BooksCorpus (800M words) and English Wikipedia (2,500M words). BERT can be used for many NLU (natural laguage understanding) tasks, including document classification. RoBERTa is a version of BERT that has been trained on a slightly modified task and with a larger corpus, including news articles, outperforming BERT on all GLUE tasks.\n\nA publicly available implementation of this model (and many more) is offered by a popular python library called [transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) created by ðŸ¤— [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/). The models are available both as PyTorch and Tensorflow models, and checkpoints are available which allow easy access to trained models ready for use. This notebook will show step by step how to use this library to solve a classification task with relevant explanations in place."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Contents\n\n1.

Loading the model and tokenizer"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The 'transformers' library contains many architectures useful for NLU. What makes this library particularly useful is that model checkpoints are available for a wide variety of models. This means that we don't have to train a new model from scratch but can instead load a pre-trained model and fine-tune it for whatever task we want. This is known as transfer learning and allows users to reuse previous knowledge, which is a more efficient way of advancing research. Within RoBERTa, different implementations are available, including a model returning the last hidden states of RoBERTa as-is, and one with a classification head stacked on top which is useful for sentiment analysis and document classification. This notebook will make use of the version that is already prepared for classification as a Tensorflow model. For an analyses that make use of a transformer model as-is and stacks a customer-made classification head on top, see [this approach (BERT)](https://www.kaggle.com/dhruv1234/huggingface-tfbertmodel).\n\nWe also need to load the tokenizer that was used to originally train the model.

Moreover, one could also consider DistilBERT, [a compact version of BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108) with 40% less parameters than BERT-base. The difference in score in this competition when using DistilBERT-base compared to BERT-large was of about 0.02 points, however training and inference were much more faster.

We will shortly see that the tokenizer can separate the special characters and read the tags and names as a word. It's not clear whether tags and names consisting of multiple words and special characters without space would repesent additional difficulties for the model. An option could be to remove these altogether. However, in this exercise, we keep tags and mentions as they appear.\n\nNext, note that the datasets do not contain unicode codes, which could stand for emojis, for example. This means this data already underwent some type of pre-processing before being published, as tweets often feature emojis in some form. In any case, we wont't have to worry about them in this example."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Contains unicode codes (e.g. emojis)?\nfor t in tweets:\n    if 'U+' in t:\n        print(t)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"However, the tweets contain some HTML character entities, these are text representations of special characters for HTML.

For instance, people often use slang, abbreviations and alternative spellings in their tweets, which are unlikely in the data set that RoBERTa was trained on. For instance, consider the common abbreviations in the following cell"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"for t in tweets:\n    if any([x in t for x in [' btw ',' omg ',' lol ',' thx ']]):\n        print(t)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Although we could replace these expressions for their word equivalents (e.g. \"tbh\": \"to be honest\"), we can immediately see that there are only a handful of examples that contain these irregularities.

In fact, these may be consider as adding some noise, which may help to prevent overfitting.\n\nNote that it is not immediately clear that we would benefit from more intrusive transformations, such as removing punctuation, numbers, undoing contractions or adding special tokens, because RoBERTa has been trained on text that contains all of these elements. Thus, the model should already be able to capture these basic elements of language as it has already seen them before. Misspelings are different, of course, however, we make no effort to fix them in this approach.

Since the last layer of this model contains 2 units, while our training targets (y) are given as a single value per example (i.e. indices, [0] or [1]), the function we must call from Tensorflow is SparseCategoricalCrossentropy. If our targets were given as two values per example (i.e. one-hot encoded, [0,1] or [1,0]), we would use CategoricalCrossentropy; and if the model had only one output, same as our targets, then we would use BinaryCrossentropy.

In modern Natural Language Processing (NLP), there are many different algorithms and techniques used to gain significant accuracy in text classification tasks.\n\nIn this notebook, we will cover three of the most popular methods for text classification: TF-IDF, Word2Vec, and transfer learning. For each of the three methods, we will also show their effectiveness based on the amount of preprocessing that is done to the text beforehand, leaving us with a total of nine measurements at the end.\n\nWe will see that transfer learning is by far the superior method for the task in terms of ease of use and accuracy.\n\nThe data that we will be using comes from [Kaggle's \"Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets\"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started) competition, where the user is tasked with predicting which tweets are about real disasters, and which ones are not.\n\nIn the competition, leaderboard position is based on the model's F1 score.

However, if we split the words up (while maintaining original order), we get: \"New York\", \"York Times\", \"New\", \"York\", and \"Times\". These separate words and phrases can occur in many contexts other than those in which the full phrase \"New York Times\" is found, skewing the phrase's true meaning in the data.

You can think of a word vector as a 1-dimensional matrix of numbers of some arbitrary length computed by neural networks. Word similarity is then determined by the [cosine distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) between two vectors.\n\nWord vectors, interestingly, can encode linguistic regularities and patterns. Therefore, many of these patterns can be represented as linear translations. For example `vector(king) - vector(man) + vector(woman)` is going to very close to `vector(queen)`. This is surprising!\n\nLet's see how word vectors do at predicting disaster tweets."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Word2Vec Preprocessing"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We'll be using gensim's Word2Vec module, which processes text using a `min_count` parameter.

This will cause problems later on when trying to classify the tweets in the validation set because some of the words will have occurred less than the `min_count` parameter, throwing an \"out-of-vocabulary\" (OOV) error.\n\nIn order to remedy this, we have two options:\n1. Train the Word2Vec model and then remove the words from the validation tweets that are not in the trained vocabulary.\n2. Preemptively change the words in our corpus that occur less than the expected `min_count` number of times with some sort of \"unknown\" character.\n\nBoth of these methods alter the original tweet that we'll be classifying, but the latter option seems to adhere closer to the original meaning of the tweet. If we drop words, we could make an entirely new sentence with an enitrely new grammatical structure and meaning. Whereas if we replace the words that occur less than `min_count` amount of times with an unknown character, the original grammatical structure of each sentence is held in tact, creating a closer tie to the tweet's original meaning.\n\nTo do this efficiently, I've created a function `replace_unknowns()` that replaces the words in a text which occur less than a specified `min_count` number of times with `'UNK'`.

It may also serve as an introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP), since it covers several data cleaning techniques and classification algorithms in order to conclude which combinations are the most succesfull.The spirit of this notebook is not to obtain a top LB score, but to learn how to deal with text data, decide which techniques are more suited for this project and why others are not recommended from a beginner perspective. \n\nHope you enjoy it and, if you like this work, I'll be glad if you upvote it.

The style is very generic for text cleaning and vectorization. The choice of model is based on cross validation and how a simple model with no bells and whistles can lead to a good f1-score. Try out various other models if you find this approach suitable. The key is not to be overwhelmed by the amount of regex operations one would like to do. This is kept minimal in this notebook where regex is applied only to get rid of the urls.

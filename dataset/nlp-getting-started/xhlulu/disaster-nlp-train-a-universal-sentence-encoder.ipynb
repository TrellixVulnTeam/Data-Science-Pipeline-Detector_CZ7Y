Built in Tensorflow, it was trained to embed any type of sentences or short paragraphs so that the meaning is as much preserved as possible; so that it can be finetuned for classification tasks specifically.\n\nThis implementation is extremely pleasant to use, since the input is simply the string, and the output is just the 512-dimensional encoded sentence; no preprocessing is needed. It is also fully-trainable, and uses an almost state-of-the-art architecture (namely, pre-BERT transformers (nice [comparison in this blog post](https://blog.floydhub.com/when-the-best-nlp-model-is-not-the-best-choice/)).\n\nSince this competition is dedicated for beginners to get started, I feel this is a perfect example of using a novel technology, but packaged in a gentle and correctly abstracted API (as opposed to the horrors of [1000 lines of tensorflow code](https://github.com/google-research/bert/blob/master/modeling.py) that needs to be understood before modifying BERT). Here, instead, **I'm only showing you some 50 lines of codes to get all up and running**; and only ~15 lines to setup the model!\n\n## Summary\n\nThis kernel serves as a short and straightforward introduction to the process of:\n1. Loading a trained model from [Tensorflow hub](https://tfhub.dev/).\n2. Building a `Sequential` Keras model by using the trained model as a layer.\n3. Training the newly created Keras model, and perform inference."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport tensorflow as tf\nimport tensorflow_hub as hub\nfrom tensorflow.keras.optimizers import Adam, SGD\nfrom tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense, Input, BatchNormalization, Dropout, Concatenate\nfrom tensorflow.keras.models import Model, Sequential\nfrom tensorflow.keras.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Load data and model"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First load all the CSV files we will need"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/nlp-getting-started/train.csv\")\ntest = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/nlp-getting-started/test.csv\")\nsubmission = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/nlp-getting-started/sample_submission.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Create convenient names for the variables we will be using for training and inference."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_data = train.text.values\ntrain_labels = train.target.values\ntest_data = test.text.values","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Finally, load the Universal Sentence Encoder from tfhub.dev (make sure Internet is enabled!)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\nmodule_url = 'https://tfhub.dev/google/universal-sentence-encoder-large/5'\nembed = hub.KerasLayer(module_url, trainable=True, name='USE_embedding')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Train the model"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Build a simple sequential model in Keras, with just a few lines.

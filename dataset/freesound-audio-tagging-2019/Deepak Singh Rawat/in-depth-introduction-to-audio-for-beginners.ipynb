If we just add it all together we get a meaningless jumble of information. \n\nRemember that the end result of our spectrogram had both time and frequency information. The color of the image at pixel (x,y) represented the magnitude of frequency y at time x. The raw signal/waveform has all time and no frequency. The fourier transform has all frequency and no time. We need something in between. \n\nWhat we really want to do is compute the fourier tranform at different points in time so that we can see the breakdown of frequencies of the sound at that time. The way to do this is through the short-time fourier transform, or STFT we saw earlier.

The STFT is taking your signal and splitting it into those chunks. Hop_length is the size (in number of samples) of those chunks. If you set hop_length to 100, the STFT will divide your 52,480 sample long signal into 525 chunks, compute the FFT (fast fourier transform, just an algorithm for computing the FT of a discrete signal) of each one of those chunks. \n\nThe output of each FFT will be a 1D tensor with n_fft # of values, each value is the magnitude of the energy for a particular range of frequencies, at that chunk of time. For example, if our min and max frequencies (something we havent covered yet) are set to 0hz and 8000hz, and my n_fft is 100, every FFT will chop that frequency range into 100 baskets, 0-80hz, 80-160hz, 160-240hz...7920hz-8000hz, and will then perform an fft on each chunk of 100 samples, and will return a 1D tensor where the first value is the magnitude of the energy in the 0-80hz range for the first 100 samples, the second value is the energy in the 80-160hz range for the first 100 samples and so on. That tensor is then rotated and becomes the first column of our STFT image. If you are not using the mel_scale, you will have n_fft as the height of your images, but if you are using the mel-scale, the height of your image will be determined by the number of mel filters you use, the parameter `n_mels`, something that is much simpler than it sounds, and that we will discuss next"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## n_mels"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Each melspectrogram in the last section was 128 pixels tall.

Let's set that to 2^10 = 1024. What should our hop be? Let's do 2^8 = 256 for now until we figure out what impact n_mels has.

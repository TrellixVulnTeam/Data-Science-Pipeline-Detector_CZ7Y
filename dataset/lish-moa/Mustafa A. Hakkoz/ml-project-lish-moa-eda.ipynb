Primary key for the dataset which links it to train_targets_scored dataset\n\n**Gene Expression** - Contains variables with g- prefix which store gene expression related information. There are about 775 gene expression variables. These variables generally have a mean around zero and range of -10 to 10\n\n**Cell Viability** - Contains variables with c- prefix which store cell viability information. There are about 100 cell viability variables. These variables also tend have a mean around zero and range of -10 to 5. The data contains negative values for Cell Viability as well, which does not make sense. We will investigate into this later\n\n**Drug Dosage** - Has distinct values for D1 & D2, signifying low and high dosage\n\n**CP Time** - Has three distinct values of 24, 28 and 72 hours\n\n**CP Type** - Indicates whether a sample has been treated with a compound or control perturbation\n\n### train_targets_scored -\nDataset containing the output variables for training data. There are about 206 binary output variables showing MoAs triggered for a specific sig_id.

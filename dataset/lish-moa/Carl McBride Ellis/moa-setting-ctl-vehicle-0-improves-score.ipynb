The \"controls\" are samples with no compounds (and hence no MoAs). In real applications, they can be used as a baseline to assess the effect of a compound treatment. Here, the best you can do is to set the probability of MoA to 0.*\"\n\non the post [About \"Controlled Perturbations\"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa/discussion/180304) by [Dorukhan Afacan](https://www.kaggle.com/afajohn).","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

Typically, a drug should have 6 records (or a multiple thereof, if it was tried in multiple experiments) one for each combination of dose (two levels) and time (3 levels), but for various reasons some of these records may not exist leading to record numbers that are not a multiple of 6.\n\nKnowing which records are from the same drug enables different forms of cross-validation (e.g. always keeping all records of a drug within the same CV fold) that might more closely match the actual prediction task. \n\nSo, let's load this data and have a look at it."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"mydir = '../input/lish-moa/'\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport seaborn as sns\n\ndrugs = pd.read_csv(mydir + 'train_drug.csv')\nscored = pd.read_csv(mydir + 'train_targets_scored.csv')\nnot_scored = pd.read_csv(mydir + 'train_targets_nonscored.csv')\n\ny_names_scored = scored.set_index('sig_id').columns.to_list()\ny_names_not_scored = not_scored.set_index('sig_id').columns.to_list()\n\nalltargets = pd.merge(\n    pd.merge(drugs, \n             scored, \n             on='sig_id', how='inner'),\n    not_scored, \n    on='sig_id', how='inner')\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So, what does the new file look like?"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"drugs","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As we can see, the file provides a link between the unique record IDs (sig_id) on the training data to a unique drug ID (drug_id).

The goal of this competition of is to advance drug development through improvements to MoA prediction algorithms. Let's first understand what is **Machanism of Action (MoA)**?\n\n## What is Mechanism of Action (MoA)?\n\nIn medicine, a term used to describe how a drug or other substance produces an effect in the body. For example, a drug‚Äôs mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment. Also called MOA. For more information check [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa/overview).\n\n## Competition Data\n\nWe have access to a unique dataset that combines gene expression and cell viability data. The data is based on the 100 different types of human cells responses to various drugs. We are provided with separate predictor(train_features.csv) and targets(train_targets_scored.csv) CSVs. Our data has - \n\n   * train_features.csv - Features for the training set. Features g- signify gene expression data, and c- signify cell viability data. cp_type indicates samples treated with a compound (cp_vehicle) or with a control perturbation (ctrl_vehicle); control perturbations have no MoAs; cp_time and cp_dose indicate treatment duration (24, 48, 72 hours) and dose (high or low).\n   \n   * train_targets_scored.csv - The binary MoA targets that are scored.\n   \n   * train_targets_nonscored.csv - Additional (optional) binary MoA responses for the training data. These are not predicted nor scored.\n   \n   * test_features.csv - Features for the test data. You must predict the probability of each scored MoA for each row in the test data.\n   \n   * sample_submission.csv - A submission file in the correct format.\n\n\n## What we are predicting? \n\n**Our goal is to classify drugs based on their biological activity**. Since drugs can have multiple MoA annotations, the task is formally a **multi-label classification problem**. Given various gene expression and cell viability features we have to predict multiple targets of the Mechanism of Action (MoA) responses of different samples."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2. <a id='2'>Import Packagesüìö</a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# import packages\nimport os, gc\nimport numpy as np\n\n# data manipulation\nimport pandas as pd\nimport pandas_profiling \n\n# visualization\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn import manifold\nimport cufflinks as cf\nimport plotly.offline\n\n# Settings\ncf.go_offline()\ncf.set_config_file(offline=False, world_readable=True)\nplt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\nplt.show()\n\n%matplotlib inline\n\nos.listdir('../input/lish-moa/')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 3. <a id='3'>Data Overviewüîç</a>\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# root directory\nROOT = '../input/lish-moa/'\n\n# files\ntarget_scored = pd.read_csv(f'{ROOT}train_targets_scored.csv')\ntarget_nonscored = pd.read_csv(f'{ROOT}train_targets_nonscored.csv')\ntrain_features = pd.read_csv(f'{ROOT}train_features.csv')\ntest_features = pd.read_csv(f'{ROOT}test_features.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3.1 <a id='3-1'>Train Data</a>\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_features.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(f'We have {train_features.shape[0]} rows and {train_features.shape[1]} columns in train_features.')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* sig_id is unique id for each sample.\n* We have **cp_type**, **cp_time** and **cp_dose** which indicates sample treated with a compound, treatment duration and dose levels respectively.\n* **\"g-\"** means gene expression data and **\"c-\"** means cell viability data."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 3.2 <a id='3-2'>Train Targets</a>\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"target_scored.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(f'We have {target_scored.shape[0]} rows and {target_scored.shape[1]} columns in target_scored.')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* We have 207 target variables.

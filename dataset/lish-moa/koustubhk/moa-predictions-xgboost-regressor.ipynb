For example, a drugâ€™s mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment. Also called MOA.\n\n\nIn this notebook, we'll predict multiple targets of the **Mechanism of Action (MoA)** responses of different samples. Samples are drugs profiled at different time points and doses. The dataset consists of various group of features and there are more than two hundred targets of enzymes and receptors.\n\nWe'll use XGBoost Regressor with specific parameter values to make our predictions.

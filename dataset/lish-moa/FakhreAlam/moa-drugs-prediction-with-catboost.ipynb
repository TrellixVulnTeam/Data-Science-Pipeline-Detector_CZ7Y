Introduction to CatBoost \n\nTable of Contents\n\nCatBoost documentation says that-\n\n\"CatBoost is a high-performance open source library for gradient boosting on decision trees.\"\"\n\nSo, CatBoost is an algorithm for gradient boosting on decision trees.\nIt is a readymade classifier in scikit-learn’s conventions terms that would deal with categorical features automatically.\nIt can easily integrate with deep learning frameworks like Google’s TensorFlow and Apple’s Core ML.\nIt can work with diverse data types to help solve a wide range of problems (described later) that businesses face today.\nIt is developed by Yandex researchers and engineers, and is used for search, recommendation systems, personal assistant, self-driving cars, weather prediction and many other tasks.\nAlso, it provides best-in-class accuracy.\nIt is especially powerful in two ways:\n1.It yields state-of-the-art results without extensive data training typically required by other machine learning methods, and\n\n2.Provides powerful out-of-the-box support for the more descriptive data formats that accompany many business problems.\n\n“CatBoost” name comes from two words - “Category” and “Boosting”.\nIt works well with multiple categories of data, such as audio, text, image including historical data.\n“Boost” comes from gradient boosting machine learning algorithm as this library is based on gradient boosting library. Gradient boosting is a powerful machine learning algorithm that is widely applied to multiple types of business challenges like fraud detection, recommendation items, forecasting and it performs well also. It can also return very good results with relatively less data, unlike DL models that need to learn from a massive amount of data.\nIt is in open-source and can be used by anyone.\n\n### 2. Advantages of CatBoost library \nTable of Contents\n\nAdvantages of CatBoost library are as follows:-\n\nPerformance: CatBoost provides state of the art results and it is competitive with any leading machine learning algorithm on the performance front.\nHandling Categorical features automatically: We can use CatBoost without any explicit pre-processing to convert categories into numbers. CatBoost converts categorical values into numbers using various statistics on combinations of categorical features and combinations of categorical and numerical features.\nRobust: It reduces the need for extensive hyper-parameter tuning and lower the chances of overfitting also which leads to more generalized models. Although, CatBoost has multiple parameters to tune and it contains parameters like the number of trees, learning rate, regularization, tree depth, fold size, bagging temperature and others.\nEasy-to-use: We can use CatBoost from the command line, using an user-friendly API for both Python and R.\n\n### 3. Comparision of CatBoost and other Boosting algorithms \nTable of Contents\n\nWe have multiple boosting libraries like XGBoost, H2O and LightGBM and all of these perform well on variety of problems.\n\nCatBoost developer have compared the performance with competitors on standard ML datasets.\n\nThis comparision is depicted in the following diagram:\n\nComparision of CatBoost and other Boosting algorithms\n\nThe comparison above shows the log-loss value for test data and it is lowest in the case of CatBoost in most cases. It clearly signifies that CatBoost mostly performs better for both tuned and default models.\n\nIn addition to this, CatBoost does not require conversion of data set to any specific format like XGBoost and LightGBM.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Importing Dataset"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"test_features =

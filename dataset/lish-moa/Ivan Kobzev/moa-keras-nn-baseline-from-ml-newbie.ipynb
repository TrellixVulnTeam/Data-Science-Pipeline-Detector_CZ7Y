The competition is about mechanisms of drugs action. First steps, such as basic info and EDA, you can find here:\n* [Insights](http://www.kaggle.com/c/lish-moa/discussion/184005)\n* [EDA](https://www.kaggle.com/isaienkov/mechanisms-of-action-moa-prediction-eda)\n\nBoth of those links might be extremely useful for you."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Briefly about my way in MoA competition \n\nI guess, everyone should have started doing his first solution based on some basic ML algorithms. Of course, me too. So, my first submission was based on logistic regression. I was training it for every label alone, and then concatenating predictions to get the submission dataframe. Unfortunately, results were frustrating. \n\nThe next step was to change LR model to something more complicated. I chose XGBClassifier. It was doing much better, but it took a couple of my life hours to tune its hyperparameters, and it's not worth the results.\n\nFinally, I was told that all the best results are based on neural networks. Until that moment I was just living with kinda small NN inside my head, but never did any NN by myself. So, everything I had was Google and motivation.\n\nI decided to share my results here with you to probably help someone else, who is also newbie, and maybe get some useful advices from someone :)\n\nGood luck with MoA competition! If you find this notebook somehow useful for you, please thumbs up :)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Code Time"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The only one library, that might confuse you, is iterstrat.

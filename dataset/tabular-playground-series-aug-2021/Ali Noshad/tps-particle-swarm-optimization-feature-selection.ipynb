The beginning of the PSO Algorithm\n\n* **Introduction**\n\nAt First, I'm going to give you a quik and basic introduction about this algorithm.\n\nParticle Swarm optimization is first attributed by Kennedy, Eberhar and Shi in their 1995 paper 'Particle Swarm Optimization'. It locates the minimum of a function by creating a number of 'particles'. These particles store their best position as well as also storing the global best position. It is this combination of local and global information that gives rise to 'swarm intelligence'.\n\nWithin an iteration, a particle will update it's position slightly towards both the swarm best and slightly towards it's personal best. With eventually the particles converging on (hopefully) the global minimum.\n\nMathematically this position update is defined as follows:\n\n$ v_i^{t + 1}=\\omega v_i^t + \\phi_br_b(x_{i_b}-x_i) + \\phi_gr_g(g_b-x_i) $\n\n$ x_i^{t + 1}=x_i^t + v_i^t $\n\nInitially every particle is given a random velocity *vi*, and the function is evaluated for every particle. Each particle is now 'aware' of it's previous best position as well as the global best position. On the first iteration it's previous best position is obviously it's current position so this term doesn't come into play until the second iteration.\n\nIt's current velocity is first scaled by a factor of w in order to ensure particle velocities don't grow exponentially over each iteration.\n\nThe term $ \\phi_br_b(x_{i_b}-x_i) $ then represents the vector from the particles position, towards it's previous best position. It is scaled by a constant $ \\phi_b $ (Here I've referred to this as c1) and a random value $ r_b $ between 0 and 1 (uniformly distributed). This random scaling provides the stochastic element of this optimization scheme.\n\nLikewise $ \\phi_gr_g(g_b-x_i) $ represents the vector from the particles position towards the swarms best position, again scaled by a constant $ \\phi_g $ and a random variable $ r_g $. Varying these phi (or c) parameters effect how locally or globally the particle explores the search space. A higher value will provide a larger vector and therefore the particle will take into account that aspect more than another.\n\nNow in the next part I'm going to explain how we can generalize this algorithm for selecting features.\n\n* **PSO Algorithm for Feature Selection**\n\nI will break down this implementation for better understanding.\n\nSo in this implementation we have 7 following functions:\n\n**1. Error Rate Function:**\n\nThis is a simple function for measuring the error for a subset of selected features.\nwe have four inputs: \n1. xtrain \n2. ytrain \n3. x: \n\nx is an array equal to number of features, this array have value of 0 and 1, 0 indicating that features are not selected based on the indexs and 1 indicating that features are selected. you can see an example of this array below:\n\nX: [1 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1\n 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0\n 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0]\n \n 4. opts:\n is a dictionary contaning required variables and parameters which I will explain further.\n \nSo, in general in this function we are going to create xtrain and ytrain based on the subset of features (x) and then we going to train a model with this features and measure its error (for Regression and Classification) and accuracy (Classification). This competition is based on error so I measured the error.\n\n**2. Fun Function:**\n\nIn general this function get error based on the selected features using the error function and then it calculates the objective function.\n\n**3. init position Function:**\n\nAs I mentioned above every index of feature has the value of zero (0) or one (1) (selected or not selected). So, how do we decide which one to set 1 (as selected) and which to set 0 (as not selected)? randomly, Of course!  (Based on the definition of the Algorithm that I've given above)\n\nSo, in this function, we are going to build N (number of population) array with the size of the features, and then, we going to initialize it with a random value between 0-1.\n\nDon't worry as we move forward it makes more sense.\n\n**4. init velocity Function:**\n\nVelocity in the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO) is one of its major features, as it is the mechanism used to move (evolve) the position of a particle to search for optimal solutions. ... This velocity regulation aims to achieve a balance between exploration and exploitation.\n\nSo, in this function we are going to initialize vlocity of each particle randomly between [-Vmax, Vmax]\nWe choose maximum and minimum velocity based on the our lower and upper bound which it is zero (0) or one (1) (selected or not selected) for selecting features.\n\n**5. binary conversion Function:**\n\nIf you remember in the init position function we randomly put value between 0-1 for each dimension of particles (N particles), as you can see the index of each feature should the value of zero or one, according to this we are going to convert these random values to 0 and 1 by seting a threshold (I set thresh to 0.5).\n\n**6. boundary Function:**\n\nIn this function we are going to check that every index value not be greater than our upper bound (which is 1) smaller than our lower bound (which is 0). (for index features)\nand the same function is also going to use for vlocity values (upper: Vmax, lower: Vmin)\n\n**7. jfs Function:**\n\nSo, lets put all of these together and run the algoritm using above functions.\nI've put comment in each line that you can see whats happening.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# error rate\ndef error_rate(xtrain, ytrain, x, opts):\n    # parameters\n    fold = opts['fold']\n    xt = fold['xt']\n    yt = fold['yt']\n    xv = fold['xv']\n    yv = fold['yv']\n    # number of instances\n    num_train = np.size(xt, 0)\n    num_valid = np.size(xv, 0)\n    # Define selected features\n    xtrain = xt[:, x == 1]\n    ytrain = yt.reshape(num_train)\n    xvalid = xv[:, x == 1]\n    yvalid = yv.reshape(num_valid)\n    # Training\n    mdl     = LinearRegression()\n    mdl.fit(xtrain, ytrain)\n    # Prediction\n    ypred   = mdl.predict(xvalid)\n    error   = mean_squared_error(yvalid, ypred, squared=False)\n    \n    return error","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-29T05:18:58.457921Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-29T05:18:58.458347Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-29T05:18:58.476266Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-29T05:18:58.458282Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-29T05:18:58.474497Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Error rate & Feature size\ndef Fun(xtrain, ytrain, x, opts):\n    # parameters\n    alpha = 0.99\n    beta = 1 -

In the past, we've launched many Playground competitions that are more approachable than our Featured competitions and thus, more beginner-friendly.\n\nIn order to have a more consistent offering of these competitions for our community, we're trying a new experiment in 2021. We'll be launching month-long tabular Playground competitions on the 1st of every month and continue the experiment as long as there's sufficient interest and participation.\n\nThe goal of these competitions is to provide a fun, and approachable for anyone, tabular dataset. These competitions will be great for people looking for something in between the Titanic Getting Started competition and a Featured competition. If you're an established competitions master or grandmaster, these probably won't be much of a challenge for you. We encourage you to avoid saturating the leaderboard.\n\nFor each monthly competition, we'll be offering Kaggle Merchandise for the top three teams. And finally, because we want these competitions to be more about learning, we're limiting team sizes to 3 individuals.\n\nThe dataset is used for this competition is synthetic, but based on a real dataset and generated using a CTGAN. The original dataset deals with calculating the loss associated with a loan defaults. Although the features are anonymized, they have properties relating to real-world features.\n\nGood luck and have fun!\n\nFor ideas on how to improve your score, check out the Intro to Machine Learning and Intermediate Machine Learning courses on Kaggle Learn.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Data Desicription**\n\nFor this competition, you will be predicting a target loss based on a number of feature columns given in the data.

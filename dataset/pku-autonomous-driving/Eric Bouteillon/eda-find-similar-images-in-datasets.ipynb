[imagededup](https://github.com/idealo/imagededup) is a powerful tool in your toolbox for various tasks like finding similar images in your dataset, find duplicated images to avoid leaks from train to test dataset...\n\n2. The test dataset has duplicated images. Some image filters were applied to hide this duplication.\n\n3. The test dataset also contains highly correlated images because they were taken at the same location within a short period of time.\n\nThanks for reading!

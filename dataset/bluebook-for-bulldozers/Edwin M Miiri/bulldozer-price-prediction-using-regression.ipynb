Data\n\nThe data is downloaded from the Kaggle Blue Book for bulldozers \ncompetition:https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data\n\nThere three main datasets:\n\n* Train.csv is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.\n* Valid.csv is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012 You make predictions on this set throughout the majority of the competition. Your score on this set is used to create the public leaderboard.\n* Test.csv is the test set, which won't be released until the last week of the competition. It contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012. Your score on the test set determines your final rank for the competition.\n\n## 3. Evaluation\n\nThe evaluation metric for this competition is the RMSLE (root mean squared log error) between the actual and predicted auction prices.\n\nFor more on the evaluation of this project check:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/overview/evaluation\n\nNote: The goal for most regression evaluation metrics  is to minimize the error.For example ,our goal for this project will be to build a machine learning model which minimises RMSLE.\n\n## 4. Features\n\nKaggle provides a data dictionary detailing all of the features of the dataset.You can view this data dictionary here:\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/download/Data%20Dictionary.xlsx\n\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport

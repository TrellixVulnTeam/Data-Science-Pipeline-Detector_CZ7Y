Namely, after asking and answering the questions, we can say the item belongs to the same group as all the other training data items that yielded the same set of answers to the questions. But what good is this? The goal of our model is to predict values for items, not to assign them into groups from the training dataset. The value is that we can now assign a prediction value for each of these groups—for regression, we take the target mean of the items in the group.\n\nLet's consider how we find the right questions to ask. Of course, we wouldn't want to have to create all these questions ourselves—that's what computers are for! The basic steps to train a decision tree can be written down very easily:\n\n1. Loop through each column of the dataset in turn.\n1. For each column, loop through each possible level of that column in turn.\n1. Try splitting the data into two groups, based on whether they are greater than or less than that value (or if it is a categorical variable, based on whether they are equal to or not equal to that level of that categorical variable).\n1. Find the average sale price for each of those two groups, and see how close that is to the actual sale price of each of the items of equipment in that group. That is, treat this as a very simple \"model\" where our predictions are simply the average sale price of the item's group.\n1. After looping through all of the columns and all the possible levels for each, pick the split point that gave the best predictions using that simple model.\n1. We now have two different groups for our data, based on this selected split. Treat each of these as separate datasets, and find the best split for each by going back to step 1 for each group.\n1. Continue this process recursively, until you have reached some stopping criterion for each group—for instance, stop splitting a group further when it has only 20 items in it.\n\nAlthough this is an easy enough algorithm to implement yourself (and it is a good exercise to do so), we can save some time by using the implementation built into sklearn.\n\nFirst, however, we need to do a little data preparation."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# my attempt at above algorithm\n# https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/10/all-about-decision-tree-from-scratch-with-python-implementation/\n\n# picking categorical and non categorical\n# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35826912/what-is-a-good-heuristic-to-detect-if-a-column-in-a-pandas-dataframe-is-categori\nlikely_cat = {}\nfor i in df.columns:\n    #print(i)\n    likely_cat[i] = 1.*df[i].nunique()/df[i].count() < 0.05 \n    \n# also handled by cont_cat_split","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"likely_cat\n\n# these are columns that mightbe categorical","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"len(df)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import math\n\n# 1 level of dcision tree split \n# with randomly chosen 1 category\n\n# looping through each column\nfor i in df.columns:\n    # looping through levels\n    #print(\"levels for \" , i)\n    #print(df[i].nunique())\n    \n    # splitting into groups\n    if(df[i].dtype.kind in 'biufc' and df[i].nunique() > 20):\n        # it means that the value is continous\n        print(\" FOR CONTINOUS \", i)\n        print(\" SPLIT AT \", df[i].mean())\n        split_mean = df[i].mean()\n        \n        # splitting dataframe based on df[i].mean()\n        df_left = df[df[i] < split_mean]\n        df_right = df[df[i] > split_mean]\n        \n        print(\" SALEPRICE FOR LEFT NODE \", df_left[dep_var].mean())\n        print(\" SALEPRICE FOR RIGHT NODE \", df_right[dep_var].mean())\n        print(\" ACTUAL SALEPRICE FOR NODE \", df[dep_var].mean())\n        \n        print(\"\\n\")\n        \n    else:\n        # it means that the value is categorical\n        print(\" FOR CATEGORICAL \", i)\n        # lets split at random unique column\n        print(\" SPLIT AT \", df[i].unique()[math.floor(len(df[i].unique())/2)])\n        split_cat =  df[i].unique()[math.floor(len(df[i].unique())/2)]\n        \n        df_cat = df[df[i] == split_cat]\n        print(\" SALEPRICE FOR SPLIT NODE \", df_cat[dep_var].mean())\n        print(\" ACTUAL SALEPRICE FOR NODE \", df[dep_var].mean())\n        \n        print(\"\\n\")\n    \n\n# we are not doing it recursively nor looping through all columns\n# but seems like it gives a better understanding about what decision tree does","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### handling dates in dataset"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Since date can be treated as ordinal value, however its format presents a unique challenge. \n\nIn fastai we convert the date into a multiple columns like holiday, day of the week, month etc. through `datepart function`"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from fastai.tabular.all import add_datepart","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = add_datepart(df, 'saledate')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# same for test\ndf_test = pd.read_csv(path/'Test.csv', low_memory=False)\ndf_test = add_datepart(df_test, 'saledate')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"[o for o in df.columns if o.startswith('sale')]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Using TabularPandas and TabularProc"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We need to handlethe missing data and strings.

As we saw, when this is applied to decision trees, this is called a random forest.\n\nThere is another important approach to ensembling, called boosting, where we add models instead of averaging them. Here is how boosting works:\n\nTrain a small model that underfits your dataset.\nCalculate the predictions in the training set for this model.\nSubtract the predictions from the targets; these are called the \"residuals\" and represent the error for each point in the training set.\nGo back to step 1, but instead of using the original targets, use the residuals as the targets for the training.\nContinue doing this until you reach some stopping criterion, such as a maximum number of trees, or you observe your validation set error getting worse.\nUsing this approach, each new tree will be attempting to fit the error of all of the previous trees combined. Because we are continually creating new residuals, by subtracting the predictions of each new tree from the residuals from the previous tree, the residuals will get smaller and smaller.\n\nTo make predictions with an ensemble of boosted trees, we calculate the predictions from each tree, and then add them all together. There are many models following this basic approach, and many names for the same models. Gradient boosting machines (GBMs) and gradient boosted decision trees (GBDTs) are the terms you're most likely to come across, or you may see the names of specific libraries implementing these; at the time of writing, XGBoost is the most popular.\n\nNote that, unlike with random forests, with this approach there is nothing to stop us from overfitting. Using more trees in a random forest does not lead to overfitting, because each tree is independent of the others. But in a boosted ensemble, the more trees you have, the better the training error becomes, and eventually you will see overfitting on the validation set.\n\nWe are not going to go into detail on how to train a gradient boosted tree ensemble here, because the field is moving rapidly, and any guidance we give will almost certainly be outdated by the time you read this. As we write this, sklearn has just added a HistGradientBoostingRegressor class that provides excellent performance. There are many hyperparameters to tweak for this class, and for all gradient boosted tree methods we have seen. Unlike random forests, gradient boosted trees are extremely sensitive to the choices of these hyperparameters; in practice, most people use a loop that tries a range of different hyperparameters to find the ones that work best.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Combining embeddings with orher methods\n\nif you first train a neural network with categorical embeddings, and then use those categorical embeddings instead of the raw categorical columns in the model. In every case, the models are dramatically improved by using the embeddings instead of the raw categories.\n\nThis is a really important result, because it shows that you can get much of the performance improvement of a neural network without actually having to use a neural network at inference time. You could just use an embedding, which is literally just an array lookup, along with a small decision tree ensemble.\n\nThese embeddings need not even be necessarily learned separately for each model or task in an organization. Instead, once a set of embeddings are learned for some column for some task, they could be stored in a central place, and reused across multiple models. In fact, we know from private communication with other practitioners at large companies that this is already happening in many places."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Conclusion"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* We have dicussed two approaches to tabular modeling: decision tree ensembles and neural networks. We've also mentioned two different decision tree ensembles: random forests, and gradient boosting machines. Each is very effective, but each also has compromises:\n\nRandom forests are the easiest to train, because they are extremely resilient to hyperparameter choices and require very little preprocessing. They are very fast to train, and should not overfit if you have enough trees. But they can be a little less accurate, especially if extrapolation is required, such as predicting future time periods.\n\nGradient boosting machines in theory are just as fast to train as random forests, but in practice you will have to try lots of different hyperparameters. They can overfit, but they are often a little more accurate than random forests.\n\nNeural networks take the longest time to train, and require extra preprocessing, such as normalization; this normalization needs to be used at inference time as well. They can provide great results and extrapolate well, but only if you are careful with your hyperparameters and take care to avoid overfitting.\n\nWe suggest starting your analysis with a random forest. This will give you a strong baseline, and you can be confident that it's a reasonable starting point. You can then use that model for feature selection and partial dependence analysis, to get a better understanding of your data.\n\nFrom that foundation, you can try neural nets and GBMs, and if they give you significantly better results on your validation set in a reasonable amount of time, you can use them. If decision tree ensembles are working well for you, try adding the embeddings for the categorical variables to the data, and see if that helps your decision trees learn better."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

Typically, in a *bottom-up* approach, you first learn all the separate components you will be using, and then you gradually build them up into more complex structures.  The problems with this are that students often lose motivation, don't have a sense of the \"big picture\", and don't know what they'll need.\n\nIf you took the fast.ai deep learning course, that is what we used.  You can hear more about my teaching philosophy [in this blog post](http://www.fast.ai/2016/10/08/teaching-philosophy/) or [in this talk](https://vimeo.com/214233053).\n\nHarvard Professor David Perkins has a book, [Making Learning Whole](https://www.amazon.com/Making-Learning-Whole-Principles-Transform/dp/0470633719) in which he uses baseball as an analogy.  We don't require kids to memorize all the rules of baseball and understand all the technical details before we let them play the game.  Rather, they start playing with a just general sense of it, and then gradually learn more rules/details as time goes on.\n\nAll that to say, don't worry if you don't understand everything at first!  You're not supposed to.  We will start using some \"black boxes\" such as random forests that haven't yet been explained in detail, and then we'll dig into the lower level details later.\n\nTo start, focus on what things DO, not what they ARE."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Your practice"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"People learn by:\n1. **doing** (coding and building)\n2. **explaining** what they've learned (by writing or helping others)\n\nTherefore, we suggest that you practice these skills on Kaggle by:\n1.

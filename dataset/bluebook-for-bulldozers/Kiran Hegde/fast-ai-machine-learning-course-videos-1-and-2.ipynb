However, random forests have a very clever trick called out-of-bag (OOB) error which can handle this (and more!)\nThe idea is to calculate error on the training set, but only include the trees in the calculation of a row's error where that row was not included in training that tree. This allows us to see whether the model is over-fitting, without needing a separate validation set.\nThis also has the benefit of allowing us to see whether our model generalizes, even if we only have a small amount of data so want to avoid separating some out to create a validation set.\nThis is as simple as adding one more parameter to our model constructor. We print the OOB error last in our print_score function below.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"c75dea3f065898c2c6c33bc935503ae9ba9f7544"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Possible explanation as to why the oob score is better here than the R2 score of the validation set, whereas Jeremy says that it should generally be lower\n#https://forums.fast.ai/t/oob-then-and-now-2017-11-vs-2018-10/23913\n#The below OOB score also proves that the validation set time difference is making a difference here.

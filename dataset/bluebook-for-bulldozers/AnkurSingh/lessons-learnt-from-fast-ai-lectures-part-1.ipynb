I really liked the teaching methodology as its completely application oriented, in oppose to other theorotical approaches in academic course. I learnt a lot of practical things,  like how to actually work with categorical features, how to normalize continuous data, how to handle missing values in your dataset, how to make the best use of timestamps in your dataset, best practices while creating trainning, validation and test datasets, what actually random forest do (intuitionally) and realized how easy it is to tuning hyperparameters and many more things.\nYou might have noted that I have used \"how to\" in front of almost all the things that I learnt because this is what I actually learnt: \"how to do something\", instead of plain theory.\n\nThis notebook is **meant for people's who want to learn all these thing but cannnot manage time to watch 1-1:30 hrs long videos** (there are 7 lectures in the ML course, in total). I tried my best:\n- To put in as much stuff as possible.\n- To keep it simple and intuitional.\n- To avoid using fastai library (I personally think it requires you to learn a lot of context).\n    \nI have taken the trouble (rather, I enjoyed doing it) of going through the code and tried replicating the codes as normal python functions. So, you can see how the things are actually implemented instead of looking at some random function name, knowing what it does but not having any clue of how its implemented.\n \n> Note: This notebook is not complete and exhaustive, I have not implemented everything that was covered in the course but I tried my best to make the notebook as end-to-end as possible.\n\n> Note: This is pretty long notebook, you might want to bookmark it.

The data is sourced from auction result postings and includes information on usage and equipment configurations.\"\n\nThis is a very common type of dataset and prediciton problem, and similar to what you may see in your project or workplace.\n\n\n\nKaggle provides info about some of the fields of our dataset; on the [Kaggle Data info page](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data) they say the following:\n\nFor this competition, you are predicting the sale price of bulldozers sold at auctions. The data for this competition is split into three parts:\n\n- **Train.csv** is the training set, which contains data through the end of 2011.\n- **Valid.csv** is the validation set, which contains data from January 1, 2012 - April 30, 2012 You make predictions on this set throughout the majority of the competition. Your score on this set is used to create the public leaderboard.\n- **Test.csv** is the test set, which won't be released until the last week of the competition. It contains data from May 1, 2012 - November 2012. Your score on the test set determines your final rank for the competition.\n\nThe key fields are in train.csv are:\n\n- SalesID: the uniue identifier of the sale\n- MachineID: the unique identifier of a machine.

With the existing information we've shown, we can't tell. However, random forests have a very clever trick called out-of-bag (OOB) error which can handle this (and more!)\n\nThe idea is to calculate error on the training set, but only include the trees in the calculation of a row's error where that row was not included in training that tree. This allows us to see whether the model is over-fitting, without needing a separate validation set.\n\nThis also has the benefit of allowing us to see whether our model generalizes, even if we only have a small amount of data so want to avoid separating some out to create a validation set.\n\nThis is as simple as adding one more parameter to our model constructor. We print the OOB error last in our print_score function below.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"11f65a7b2436d2338c9cf66fdaa344237f968792","trusted":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"## Also a BASELINE MODEL to which all the other models will be compared.\nm = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=40, n_jobs=-1, oob_score=True)\nm.fit(X_train, y_train)\nprint_score(m)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"b3ca5243665eb71335a29018402d60d6c5ef41ac"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There's a huge difference between validation_score and oob_score.

So, more than a test for model's performance, oob_score is test for \"how representative is your Validation_set\".\n\nYou should always make sure that you have a good representative validation_set, because it's score is used as an indicator for our model's performance.

You should be proud of yourself for doing it. We have briefly talked about the following:\n- How to extract features from timestamps\n- How to work with categorical features\n- How to work with continuous features\n- How to handle missing values in both continuous and categorical features\n- Need to have a validation set\n- OOB score and its importances\n- How we can fine tune parameters of random forest\n\nIn practice, random forest is the best model for most data because most data is not random. A random-forest decision tree works for almost every structured-data problem. You just have to tune it properly for the data in-hand.\n\nWe have [Part-2](https://www.kaggle.com/ankursingh12/lessons-learnt-from-fast-ai-lectures-part-2) of this notebook lined up.

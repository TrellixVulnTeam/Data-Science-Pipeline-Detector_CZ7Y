Ion channels are pore-forming proteins present in animals and plants. They encode learning and memory, help fight infections, enable pain signals, and stimulate muscle contraction. \n\nWhen ion channels open, they pass electric currents. Existing methods of detecting these state changes are slow and laborious. In this competition, we will use ion channel data to better model automatic identification methods.\n\n![Pic](https://storage.googleapis.com/kaggle-media/competitions/Liverpool/ion%20image.jpg)\n\n### Notebook Objective\n\nObjective of the notebook is to explore the given data and find any useful insghts along the way.\n\n### Dataset Summary\n\nFirst let us look at the files that are given to us."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.patches as patches\n\nfrom plotly import tools, subplots\nimport plotly.offline as py\npy.init_notebook_mode(connected=True)\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport plotly.express as px\npd.set_option('max_columns', 100)\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We have been given three files - train, test and sample submission.

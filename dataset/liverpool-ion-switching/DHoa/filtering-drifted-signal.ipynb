The idea is conceived when I came across this notebook https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/one-feature-model-0-930 .The author manually model the drifted signal (take some points from the graph then fit a polinomial) and it is very natural in this case because the signal is just 1st and 2nd order. But how about in a real case when it is not that evident.\n\nIn signal processing, people normally try to use a high pass filter to remove this low frequency signal"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom scipy import signal\nfrom scipy.fft import fftshift","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/liverpool-ion-switching/train.csv')\ntest_df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/liverpool-ion-switching/test.csv')\nsample_sub = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/liverpool-ion-switching/sample_submission.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The original signal is plotted as below.

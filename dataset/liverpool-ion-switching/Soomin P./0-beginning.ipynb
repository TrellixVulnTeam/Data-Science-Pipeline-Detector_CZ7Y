They encode learning and memory, help fight infections, enable pain signals, and stimulate muscle contraction. If scientists  ion ccould better studyhannels, which may be possible with the aid of machine learning, it could have a far-reaching impact. <br>\n> When ion channels open, they** pass electric currents**. ... Scientists hope that technology could enable **rapid automatic detection of ion channel current events in raw data.** <br>\n> ... use **ion channel data** to better model **automatic identification** methods. If successful, youâ€™ll be able to **detect individual ion channel events in noisy raw signals.** The data is simulated and injected with real world noise to emulate what scientists observe in laboratory experiments.\n\n#### Evaluation\n- [macro F1 score](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html)\n- In \"macro\" F1 a separate F1 score is calculated for each open_channels value and then averaged.\n- Submission: **For each time value** in the test set, you must **predict open_channels**.

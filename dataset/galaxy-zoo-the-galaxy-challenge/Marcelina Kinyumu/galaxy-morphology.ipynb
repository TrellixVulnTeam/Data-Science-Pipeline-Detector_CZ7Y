The galaxies are classified following the Hubble classifications as either spirals, ellipticals or irregulars if they do not fit in any of the previous classifications. Traditionally, galaxies are classified by visualy inspecting galaxy images. With the increase in the number of observed samples, visual classification is not only time consuming or labour intensive, but nearly imposible to classify large galaxy samples. Their is a need to automate the classifications that can replace the visual classifications with high accuracy . \n\nThe Galaxy Zoo Project 2 classfied around 200,000 galaxy images obtained from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), DR7 and other similar surveys. The images are classified into respective categories (37) following a set of 11 questions with the help of the public (citizen scientist).\n\nThe project used the Galaxy Zoo dataset from kaggle consisting of 61,578 galaxy images in the training dataset and 79,973 images for the test dataset.","metadata":{"id":"Ftad4UBF6JUt"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Overview\n\nThe main aim of this project is to build a model that can automate the galaxy classification in to two main categories (spirals and ellipticals) with very high accuracy.\n\nThis notebook contain the following sections,\n- Data Exploration\n- Selection Method\n- Data Preprocessing\n- Methodology\n- Model Training \n- Model Visualization\n- Conclusions and Recommendations\n\n\n\n## Exploring and Understanding the Dataset\n\nWhile the traing dataset contain 61,578 images, the training_solution_rev1.csv file has the information regarding the probablities of a galaxies belonging to the respective classes. From the 37 classes, the main categories of interest are classes 1.1 and 1.2. Based on the first classification question, class 1.1 give the probability of a galaxy being smooth (elliptical) and class 1.2 gives the probability of it having features or disk(spirals). \n\nFor a more clean sample, we used the images classified with a more than 0.8 probability as belonging to the two classes and labeling then appropriatly. Out of all the traing dataset images, only 24,273 satisfied our requement (>= 0.8 probability in either class 1.1 or 1.2). We separated the data that satisfied our requarements into a new dataframe. When inspecting the new dataframe, no duplicates or missing values were found.\n","metadata":{"id":"klhj05kk7DqI"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#importing required libraries for data exploration\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np","metadata":{"id":"TGRwSYr7-72m","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-12T03:05:32.585016Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-12T03:05:32.585677Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-12T03:05:32.58981Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-12T03:05:32.585639Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-12T03:05:32.589225Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#reading the training csv file and displaying the first 5 row \n#to have a better understanding of the classes\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"../input/galaxy-zoo-the-galaxy-challenge/training_solutions_rev1.zip\",\n                   compression=\"zip\")\n\n#data = pd.read_csv('training_solutions_rev1.csv')\ndata.head(5)","metadata":{"id":"jQmhuGCuCx0s","outputId":"3e7e1d58-fd0e-4505-f435-965c4ebe40eb","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-12T03:05:33.60941Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-12T03:05:33.6097Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-12T03:05:34.178446Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-12T03:05:33.609665Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-12T03:05:34.177423Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#looking for the number of rows and colunm in the dataframe\ndata.shape","metadata":{"id":"oKrXhjE2EHv5","outputId":"4c4dcb76-117e-4783-c103-0e2d5c76a2ea","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-12T03:05:35.25352Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-12T03:05:35.253833Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-12T03:05:35.259671Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-12T03:05:35.253805Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-12T03:05:35.258925Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We define a fuction that will be used to add the image type extection to the GalaxyID.

Methodology\nFor the mvp, the 1000 cropped images were used to train the model while trying both gray scale and the RGB scale. The models trained with the RGB scale performed better which showed the importance of colour in galaxy classifcations. Unfortunately, it was harder to get a good performance with such a small sample. We later included the earlier selected sample of 16,000 galaxies in RGB colour as the training sample and tried optimizing on the number of layers, filters and other parameters to improve the model performance.\n\nTo prepare the data for model training we used the ImageDataGenerator and the training dataframe for the image id and the class columns to lable the images. We resized the image size to 212 x 212, used the RGB colour and a batch_size of 32. The training (80%) and the validation (20%) datasets were separated by the 80-20 rule. We randomly shuffled the images so that the model will not learn to classfy one category more. The elliptical galaxies have the zero lable (0) while the spiral galaxies have the one (1).\n\nThe model that gave us an optimum performance was a cnn model with seven layers which include an input layer, three fully connected layers and the final three dense layers with relu activation functions for all layers as shown in the model summary. We used the categorical_crossentropy loss function, Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.001 and measured the accuracy. Checkpoints and early stoppings where used to prevent the model from overfitting and only saving the best model.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Model

Conclusion and Recommendations\n### Conclusion\nThe model architecture seem to perform considerably well for our sample with an optimized  validation and test accuracy within the range (96 - 98)%. More augmentation is needed for the model to generalise well. However,from random image predictions and plotting the heat maps form the model, it seemed that most of the galaxies well classified as spiral galaxies were the disk like spiral galaxy type (See the first image and the corresponding image heat map in the Model Visualization). Surprisingly, galaxies with very well defined and observed arms are strongly mis-classified as elliptical. But going back to the images, it was evident that our selected sample of spriral galaxies was heavily bias towards the disk like structures. The small number of spiral galaxies were maybe consided outliers by our model.\n\n### Recommendations\n- Based on the type of galaxies classifed as spiral glaxies, it maybe important for the sample of spiral galaxies to be balanced between the two or more classifications added for an improvement in the classifications.\n- The traing data could be increased by including the galaxies with a lower percentage fraction in our selection criteria.\n- Linear based models can be used to compare our model perfomance with.","metadata":{}}]}

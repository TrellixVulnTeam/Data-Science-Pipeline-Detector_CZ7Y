Typically, in order to improve model performance, we can either pursue hyperparameter tuning in order to find the best set of hyperparameters corresponding to data or we can pursue model ensembling - bagging, boosting and stacking.\n\nHowever, performing an exhaustive search among a large space of hyperparameters can be highly time-consuming. At the same time, if your training data changes, the best set of hyperparameters you found out may no longer be the best, and so you would have to find them again.\n\nThis is the reason why AutoGluon focuses on building highly stacked ensembles, believing that you can still achieve optimal model performances without tuning hyperparameters at all.\n\nTutorials: https://auto.gluon.ai/dev/tutorials/tabular_prediction/index.html\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/awslabs/autogluon/","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install --upgrade mxnet-cu100\n!pip install autogluon","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-13T17:28:32.232473Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-13T17:28:32.2328Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-13T17:29:37.881063Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-13T17:28:32.232728Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-13T17:29:37.880148Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load the dataset\nfrom autogluon.tabular import TabularDataset, TabularPredictor\ntrain_data = TabularDataset('../input/tabular-playground-series-jun-2021/train.csv')\ntest_data = TabularDataset('../input/tabular-playground-series-jun-2021/test.csv')","metadata":{"id":"VHqLNcQUe8Ib","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-13T17:29:37.884457Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-13T17:29:37.884715Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-13T17:29:42.067464Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-13T17:29:37.884687Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-13T17:29:42.066492Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_data.head(5)","metadata":{"id":"nUCJqUJ_IuLn","outputId":"692e8adf-3aea-4203-ba9c-42a29856ebf7","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-13T17:29:42.070967Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-13T17:29:42.071244Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-13T17:29:42.103461Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-13T17:29:42.071217Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-13T17:29:42.10242Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"test_data.head(5)","metadata":{"id":"9MWC5AFPbdMf","outputId":"ef261379-e2f7-4a04-8f7c-2de14b6225ad","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-13T17:29:42.680747Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-13T17:29:42.681117Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-13T17:29:42.70088Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-13T17:29:42.681079Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-13T17:29:42.699705Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Some pointers to note about AutoGluon:\n1.

It is very important to specify the time limits.

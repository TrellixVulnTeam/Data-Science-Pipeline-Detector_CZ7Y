I'm a baby Kaggler who joined Kaggle 4 years ago but never participated in a Competitions or wrote any code. Let's start Kaggle with this 'Tabular Playground Series - Jun 2021'! \n\nIt's not enough yet, but I want to share a really, really, really simple code so that a baby Kaggler who is starting out like me can just submit. \n\nIt's my first time sharing code, but I'm really looking forward to being able to write more beautiful codes as I grow.\n\nWith this code sharing as an opportunity, I'm going to try to go from writing really easy code so that many beginners like me can come in, to the code to submit with a gold medal in the competition, although I don't know when. \n\nLet's work hard together!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image:

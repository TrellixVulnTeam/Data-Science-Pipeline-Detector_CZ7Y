Most of the features are anonimized as chars (characteristics) but weâ€™ll try to see how they are related to the outcome.\n\nClassification performance measured in AUC."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Initial Hypotheses:\n\n1.

Each person has a unique people_id. Contains characteristis of people.\n\n_ Activity.csv:\nThe activity file contains all of the unique activities (and the corresponding activity characteristics) that each person has performed over time. Each row in the activity file represents a unique activity performed by a person on a certain date. Each activity has a unique activity_id. \n\nThe activity file contains several different categories of activities. Type 1 activities are different from type 2-7 activities because there are more known characteristics associated with type 1 activities (nine in total) than type 2-7 activities (which have only one associated characteristic)."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport os\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"activities_train = pd.read_csv('../input/predicting-red-hat-business-value/act_train.csv.zip', parse_dates=['date'])\nactivities_test = pd.read_csv('../input/predicting-red-hat-business-value/act_test.csv.zip', parse_dates=['date'])\nppl = pd.read_csv('../input/predicting-red-hat-business-value/people.csv.zip', parse_dates=['date'])\n\ndf_train = pd.merge(activities_train, ppl, on='people_id')\ndf_test = pd.merge(activities_test, ppl, on='people_id')\ndel activities_train, activities_test, ppl","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(df_test.shape)\nprint(df_train.shape)\nprint(df_train.shape[0]/df_test.shape[0])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_train.head(5)\ndf_test.head(5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_train.info(null_counts=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"print(df['SalePrice'].describe())\nplt.figure(figsize=(9, 8))\nsns.distplot(df['SalePrice'], color='g', bins=100, hist_kws={'alpha': 0.4});"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"Data Analysis\n\n\nThere are 189k potential customers and 2.1M customer activities in the training set.\nThe test set contains 498k customer activities (train/test split of activities 18.5% in test)\n\npotential typos/mistakes in mixed-type fields:\npeople: ppl_group, ppl_char_1 - 9\nactivity: act_category, act_char_10\n\nMissing data\nppl: No missing data detected by pandas\nactivities: act_char_1-9 have same number of missing values.

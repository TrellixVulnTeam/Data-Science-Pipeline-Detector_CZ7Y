But primarily becasue I am familiar with it, and it's part of Rapids library, whcih I am all too eager to promote. ;) Unfortunately, cuGraph is still not available in Kaggle Docker, so I have to install it from skrach here from Chris Deotte's dataset."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import sys\n!cp ../input/rapids/rapids.0.18.0 /opt/conda/envs/rapids.tar.gz\n!cd /opt/conda/envs/ && tar -xzvf rapids.tar.gz > /dev/null\nsys.path = [\"/opt/conda/envs/rapids/lib/python3.7/site-packages\"] + sys.path\nsys.path = [\"/opt/conda/envs/rapids/lib/python3.7\"] + sys.path\nsys.path = [\"/opt/conda/envs/rapids/lib\"] + sys.path \n!cp /opt/conda/envs/rapids/lib/libxgboost.so /opt/conda/lib/","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import cugraph","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import cupy as cp\nimport cuml, cudf\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split \n\nfrom cuml.metrics import mean_squared_error\nfrom tqdm.notebook import tqdm","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"WRSCResults = cudf.read_csv('../input/ncaaw-march-mania-2021/WDataFiles_Stage2/WRegularSeasonCompactResults.csv')\nWTeams = cudf.read_csv('../input/ncaaw-march-mania-2021/WDataFiles_Stage2/WTeams.csv')\nWRSCResults.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"WTeams.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"WRSCResults_2021 = WRSCResults[WRSCResults['Season'] == 2021]\nWRSCResults_2021.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"G1 = cugraph.Graph()\nG1.from_cudf_edgelist(WRSCResults_2021, source='LTeamID', destination='WTeamID')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pr1 = cugraph.pagerank(G1, alpha = 0.85, max_iter = 500, tol = 1.0e-05)\npr1.columns = ['pagerank', 'TeamID']\npr1 = pr1.merge(WTeams)\npr1 = pr1.sort_values(by='pagerank',  ascending=False).reset_index(drop=True)\npr1.head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We see that some of the top teams are all relatively unknown, and not really otherwise that highly ranked.

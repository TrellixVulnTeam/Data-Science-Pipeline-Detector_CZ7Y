Since most machine learning models only accept numerical variables, preprocessing the categorical variables becomes a necessary step. We need to convert these categorical variables to numbers such that the model is able to understand and extract valuable information.\n\n\nIn the 1940s, Stanley Smith Stevens introduced four scales of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio. These are still widely used today as a way to describe the characteristics of a variable. Knowing the scale of measurement for a variable is an important aspect in choosing the right statistical analysis.\n#  \n\n![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/7jyxzQ2ObysJGLFcGB6Zc25AHAswexk68SbOh_KYa4if2P9yRe7lIC8NDUgZEcSGspqpRIGQcMx_qCmrG6sjHegFHy9Sqhp_1z3PFido6d19TKYFq0pMTHDs4OV9l6pP-MTNmeKu)\n[image ref: What is the difference between ordinal, interval and ratio variables? Why should I care?](https://www.graphpad.com/support/faq/what-is-the-difference-between-ordinal-interval-and-ratio-variables-why-should-i-care/)\n\n#  \n\nUsually there are 2 kinds of categorical data:\n\n- Ordinal Data: The categories have an inherent order\nlike: socio economic status (“low income”,”middle income”,”high income”), education level (“high school”,”BS”,”MS”,”PhD”), income level (“less than 50K”, “50K-100K”, “over 100K”), satisfaction rating (“extremely dislike”, “dislike”, “neutral”, “like”, “extremely like”)\n- Nominal Data: The categories do not have an inherent order \nlike: blood type, zip code, gender, race, ethnicity\n\nAlso binary data could be nominal or ordinal.\n\nGenerally, In Ordinal data, while encoding, one should retain the information regarding the order in which the category is provided. While encoding Nominal data, we have to consider the presence or absence of a feature. In such a case, no notion of order is present. \n\n\n\n","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.06778,"end_time":"2020-12-27T19:57:11.657091","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-12-27T19:57:11.589311","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So how should we select encoding methods is depends algorithm(s) we apply :\n        \n- Some algorithms can work with categorical data directly e.g CatBoost , or For example, a decision tree can be learned directly from categorical data with no data transform required (this depends on the specific implementation).\n\n- Many machine learning algorithms cannot operate on label data directly. They require all input variables and output variables to be numeric.\n\n- Some implementations of machine learning algorithms require all data to be numerical. For example, scikit-learn has this requirement.\n\n- If we categorize algorithms to linear and tree based models we sholuld consider that generally linear models are sensitive to order of ordinal data so we should select appropriate encoding methods. \n\n\n\n","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.065608,"end_time":"2020-12-27T19:57:11.78981","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-12-27T19:57:11.724202","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":">## **Content:**\n>    \n>#### 1.

Hashing is the transformation of arbitrary size input in the form of a fixed-size value. We use hashing algorithms to perform hashing operations i.e to generate the hash value of an input. Further, hashing is a one-way process, in other words, one can not generate original input from the hash representation.\n\nHashing has several applications like data retrieval, checking data corruption, and in data encryption also. We have multiple hash functions available for example Message Digest (MD, MD2, MD5), Secure Hash Function (SHA0, SHA1, SHA2), and many more.\n\nJust like one-hot encoding, the Hash encoder represents categorical features using the new dimensions. Here, the user can fix the number of dimensions after transformation using n_component argument. Here is what we mean – A feature with 5 categories can be represented using N new features similarly, a feature with 100 categories can also be transformed using N new features. \n\nBy default, the Hashing encoder uses the md5 hashing algorithm but a user can pass any algorithm of his choice.

The distribution of parameters before seeing any data is called prior distribution. This distribution is updated based on the new data to become a posterior distribution. The prediction on the unseen data can be derived by marginalizing over the parameter space. To avoid intractable integrals, Bayesian practitioners often use Conjugate Priors.

This is the case for gender (male/female), bought a product (yes/no), attended a course (yes/no). When a category has several levels, as with nationality, assigning numbers to each level implies an order of the levels. This means that one level of the category has a lower rank than another level. While this makes sense for ordinal variables (e.g., preferences of food items or educational degree), it is a wrong assumption for nominal variables such as color preferences, nationality, residential city specially when we use linear Algorithms. Algorithms like CatBoost have different perspective to solve this problem.  \n\nWe can use CatBoost without any explicit pre-processing to convert categories into numbers. CatBoost converts categorical values into numbers using various statistics on combinations of categorical features and combinations of categorical and numerical features.\n\nIn detail , Catboost calculates for every category of a nominal variable , a value (target-based statistic). This is done using a number of steps:\nWe begin with one categorical feature (e.g., Nationality). This is called x.\nIn one randomly chosen row (k-th row in the training data set), we exchange one random level of this categorical feature (i-th level of x) with a number (e.g., Dutch by 5)\nThis number (in our example 5) is usually based on the target variable (the one we want to predict) conditional on the category level. In other words, the target number is based on the expected outcome variable.\nA splitting attribute is used to create two sets of the training data: One set that has all categories (e.g., German, French, Indian etc) who will have greater target variable than the one computed in step 3, and the other set with smaller target variables.\n\n![catb](https://developer-blogs.nvidia.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/catboost_hero.png)\n\nIn their [paper](http://learningsys.org/nips17/assets/papers/paper_11.pdf) authors describe how catboost is dealing with categorical features. The standard way is to compute some statistics, such as median, based on the label values of the category. However, this creates problems if there is only one example for a label value. In this case, the numerical value of the category would be the same than the label value. For example if in our example with nationalities, the category Belgian is assigned the value 2, and there is only 1 Belgian student, this student would get the value 2 for nationality. This can create problems of overfitting.\n\nTo avoid this problem, the authors designed a solution which involves randomly changing the order of rows in the complete data set. We perform a random permutation of the data set and for each example we compute average label value for the example with the same category value placed before the given one in the permutation .In their paper they also describe how different features are combined to create a new feature. Think about it, every individual observations of categorical and numerical data points describe one observation. The chances that two observations are exactly identical is slim. Hence, different categorical values and numerical values could be combined to create a unique merged categorical variable which contains all the different individual choices. While this might sound easy, doing this for all potential types of combinations will be computational intensive.\nAnother way to combine different features is to do a greedy search at every tree split. Catboost does this by combining all categorical and numerical values at the current tree with all categorical values in the data set.\n\nTransforming categorical features to numerical features methods are:\n\n\n- Borders\n- Buckets\n- BinarizedTargetMeanValue\n- Counter\n\n\n You can read more about it [here](https://catboost.ai/docs/concepts/algorithm-main-stages_cat-to-numberic.html).","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.104283,"end_time":"2020-12-27T19:57:54.996847","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-12-27T19:57:54.892564","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train = tr_orig.copy()\ntest = ts_orig.copy()\n\ntarget = train.pop('target')\ncategorical_features_indices = np.where(train.dtypes == 'object')[0]\ncategorical_features_indices","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-12-27T19:57:55.217088Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-12-27T19:57:55.216341Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-12-27T19:57:55.252262Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-12-27T19:57:55.251686Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.148628,"end_time":"2020-12-27T19:57:55.252405","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-12-27T19:57:55.103777","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\ncat_score = []\n# Split data with kfold\nkfolds = KFold(n_splits=3, shuffle=True, random_state=2018)\ntrain_features = train.columns\n# Make importance dataframe\nimportances = pd.DataFrame()\n\noof_preds = np.zeros(train.shape[0])\nsub_preds = np.zeros(test.shape[0])\n\nfor n_fold, (trn_idx, val_idx) in enumerate(kfolds.split(train, target)):\n    X_train, y_train = train.iloc[trn_idx], target.iloc[trn_idx]\n    X_valid, y_valid = train.iloc[val_idx], target.iloc[val_idx]\n    \n    # CatBoost Regressor estimator\n    model = cb.CatBoostRegressor(\n        learning_rate = 0.1,\n        iterations = 2000,\n        eval_metric = 'RMSE',\n        allow_writing_files = False,\n        od_type = 'Iter',\n        bagging_temperature = 0.8,\n        depth = 6,\n        od_wait = 20,\n        silent = False\n    )\n    \n    # Fit\n    model.fit(\n        X_train, y_train,\n        cat_features=categorical_features_indices,\n        eval_set=[(X_train, y_train), (X_valid, y_valid)],\n        verbose=100,\n        early_stopping_rounds=100\n    )\n    \n    # Feature importance\n    imp_df = pd.DataFrame()\n    imp_df['feature'] = train_features\n    imp_df['gain'] = model.get_feature_importance()\n    imp_df['fold'] = n_fold + 1\n    importances = pd.concat([importances, imp_df], axis=0, sort=False)\n    \n    oof_preds[val_idx] = model.predict(X_valid)\n    cat_score.append(np.sqrt(mean_squared_error(y_valid, oof_preds[val_idx])))\n    test_preds = model.predict(test)\n    sub_preds += test_preds / kfolds.n_splits\n    \nprint(np.mean(cat_score))\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-12-27T19:57:55.482629Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-12-27T19:57:55.477421Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-12-27T19:59:35.478493Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-12-27T19:59:35.477591Z"},"papermill":{"duration":100.118647,"end_time":"2020-12-27T19:59:35.478662","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-12-27T19:57:55.360015","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"importances['gain_log'] = importances['gain']\nmean_gain = importances[['gain', 'feature']].groupby('feature').mean()\nimportances['mean_gain'] = importances['feature'].map(mean_gain['gain'])\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(20, 8))\nsns.barplot(x='gain_log', y='feature', data=importances.sort_values('mean_gain', ascending=False), palette='vlag')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2020-12-27T19:59:35.993457Z","iopub.status.busy":"2020-12-27T19:59:35.975061Z","iopub.status.idle":"2020-12-27T19:59:36.738856Z","shell.execute_reply":"2020-12-27T19:59:36.738295Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.890892,"end_time":"2020-12-27T19:59:36.73899","exception":false,"start_time":"2020-12-27T19:59:35.848098","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## **8.

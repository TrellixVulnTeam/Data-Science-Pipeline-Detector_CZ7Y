In few figures, curve had a litte twist around the date of orders, however the changes are too ambiguaous to be judged as a significant connection. Does this mean that enforing quarantine, closing schools, shutting down public place, limiting gathering and close none essential business are useless? Of cause not, from what we heard and watched in news throughout the pendemic, it is known that not everyone is following the guide. Administative orders are declarations. It depends on each person to put them in to action.    \n\nCOVID-19's character of spread before showing symptom tests our responsibility to our community. When we do not have syptom, will we still willing to restrict our activity to protect others. When we look at two countries that bend the curve Hubei, China and South Korea. China has strong administative action power which we can assume that quarantine order was enforced. That is staying home, shutting down none essential, social distancing. Therefore the curve bend later on. South Korea only had a closing school order. But we know they are rigorously follow the guide from the news. They bend the curve too. The take away here is that it's not what we say but do that matters. And one irresponsible carrier can infect a bunch. \n\nAnother thing is that this gonna be a long fight. Even under strong measures South Korea hasn't reach the flat point. And it tooks a long time after the quarantine order did Hubei, China reach the flat point. It takes some while for people's action to take effect.   \n\nTo sum up, everyone needs chip in following the guide of local or global health authority. Please think a little more about others when you can't stand the boring and loneliness of staying home. Make some change to your social habit for the sake of others. Lastly let's have more patience and persistency, because we will win this fight eventually.\n\n##### Stay safe everyone. Good luck on the competition and I will see you in the next analysis."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

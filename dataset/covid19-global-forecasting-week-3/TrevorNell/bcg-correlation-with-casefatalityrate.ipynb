And by decent I mean we can calculate how many observations should be in each group.\n\nLet us say that we hypothesize that there is a higher fatality rate in countries who never had a universal BCG policy than their counterparts who do have a universal one. A test of hypothesis will be conducted to compare fatality rates of the countries who never had a universal BCG policy with the countries who did. If we deem that a 3 fold increase would be clinically meaningful(from 3% (the average in those countries with universal policy and who are IncomeLevel = 3 or 4)  to 9% (Italy for instance)) then how many countries should be enrolled in the study to ensure that the power of the test is 80% to detect this difference in the groups? A two sided test will be used with a 5% level of significance.  \n\nWe first compute the effect size by substituting the proportions of cases in each group who are expected to pass away from the disease, p1=0.09 (i.e., 0.03*3.0=0.09) and p2=0.03 and the overall proportion, p=0.06 (i.e., (0.09+0.03)/2):"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from math import sqrt\nr=0.03\np1=r*3\np2=r\np=(p1+p2)/2.0\nES = (p1-p2)/sqrt(p*(1-p))\nES","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So now that we have calculated the effect size, let us go ahead and calculate the sample size required in each group:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# estimate sample size via power analysis\nfrom statsmodels.stats.power import TTestIndPower\n# parameters for power analysis\neffect = ES\nalpha = 0.05\npower = 0.8\n# perform power analysis\nanalysis = TTestIndPower()\nresult = analysis.solve_power(effect, power=power, nobs1=None, ratio=1.0, alpha=alpha)\nprint('Sample Size: %.3f' % result)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"it would seem that we need 246 observations in each group.

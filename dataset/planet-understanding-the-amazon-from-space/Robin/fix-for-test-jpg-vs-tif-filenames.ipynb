These files are named \"file_XXXX.tif\", and the corresponding jpg and tif files have been out of sync. So `file_10.jpg` doesn't look anything like `file_10.tif`. For the curious, this was caused by overaggressive filename randomization. [facepalm]\n\nThis kernel highlights the issue, and shows how to fix it using the new `test_v2_file_mapping.csv`. No need to download data again! N.B. you could also easily just use `test_v2_file_mapping.csv` and shell commands to manipulate the files.\n\nThanks to @hengck23 and others for pointing this out.

The spread of COVID-19 has sent shockwaves across the globe. \n\nSome countries have introduced short-term support measures such as providing digital learning devices, financial support for students and schools and funds for safety and cleaning equipment. Online platforms were used in countries through: (a) educational content, (b) real-time lessons on virtual meeting platforms, and (c) self-paced formalised lessons.  \n\nOne of the limitations of emergency remote learning is the loss of intructional time delivered in a school setting and the lack of personal interaction between teacher and student.\n\nIn this study, we investigate the different modes of learning and the socioeconomic factors that may contribute to the engagement level amongst students.

Conclusion & Proposed Recommendations**\n* **Over Time:** The mean engagement index had improved over the course of 2020, with a significant dip between April and July before picking up again in August. This could be attributed to the 10/11-week summer break in USA beginning between May and June and ending between August and September. Notably, September was the month with the highest mean engagement index. \n* **Digital Learning Tools:** Amongst the different learning tools, Learning & Curriculum (LC) had achieved the highest adoption. Specifically, the digital learning platform was the subcategory that yielded the highest take-up rate. Despite the high adoption rate of LC/digital learning platforms, the mean engagement level is the highest in the school & district operations (SDO), followed by classroom management (CM), LC and a combination of the three. Therefore, more could be done to boost the  adoption of SDO tools to increase engagement index.\n* **Sectors:** In addition, the sector with the highest adoption rate was PreK-12. By contrast, corporate and higher ed sectors made up the minority of the demand for learning tools. The mean engagement level is highest in the Prek12, higher ed and corporate sector, followed by prek-12; corporate; prek12, higher ed; and higher ed and corporate. \n* **Expenditure:** The expenditure data are school-by-school, and we use the median value to represent the expenditure of a given school district. By locales, the rural and suburb areas have ramped up its total-pupil total expenditure compared to the city and town areas. The rural and suburb are also the areas with higher engagement index.\n* **One page-load event:** The percentage of students in the district that have at least one page-load event of a given product and on a given day is the highest in the rural and suburb areas, followed by town and city. This may imply that the higher the percentage of students that have at least one page-load event of a given product on a given day, the higher the engagement level in rural and suburb areas. This hypothesis was also validated. \n* **% of Blacks/Hispanics/Lunch Subsidies:** As the minimum percentage of blacks/hispanics increases, the greater the minimum percentage of students in the districts that is eligible for free or reduced-price lunch based on 2018-19 NCES data. The engagement index is consistent across the different communities with different minimum percentage of blacks/hispanics and those eligible for free/reduced-price lunch. This may imply that the engagement index is independent of socioeconomic factors.\n* **Strength of Internet Connection:** ratio (residential fixed high-speed connections over 200 kbps in at least one direction/households) based on the county level data from FCC From 477 (December 2018 version). From Jan 2020 to Dec 2020, the mean minimum connection ratio and mean maximum connection ratio remain constant.\n* Further investigation would be required to ensure that the findings above are conclusive.","metadata":{}}]}

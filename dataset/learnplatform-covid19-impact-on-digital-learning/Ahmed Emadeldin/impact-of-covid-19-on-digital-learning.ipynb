District information data\r\n\r\nThe district file `districts_info.csv` includes information about the characteristics of school districts, including data from [NCES](https://nces.ed.gov/) (2018-19), [FCC](https://www.fcc.gov/) (Dec 2018), and [Edunomics Lab](https://edunomicslab.org/). In this data set, we removed the identifiable information about the school districts. We also used an open source tool [ARX](https://arx.deidentifier.org/) [(Prasser et al. 2020)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/spe.2812) to transform several data fields and reduce the risks of re-identification. For data generalization purposes some data points are released with a range where the actual value falls under. Additionally, there are many missing data marked as 'NaN' indicating that the data was suppressed to maximize anonymization of the dataset. \r\n\r\n| Name | Description |\r\n| :--- | :----------- |\r\n| district_id | The unique identifier of the school district |\r\n| state | The state where the district resides in |\r\n| locale | NCES locale classification that categorizes U.S. territory into four types of areas: City, Suburban, Town, and Rural. See [Locale Boundaries User's Manual](https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED577162) for more information. |\r\n| pct_black/hispanic | Percentage of students in the districts identified as Black or Hispanic based on 2018-19 NCES data |\r\n| pct_free/reduced | Percentage of students in the districts eligible for free or reduced-price lunch based on 2018-19 NCES data |\r\n| county_connections_ratio | `ratio` (residential fixed high-speed connections over 200 kbps in at least one direction/households) based on the county level data from FCC From 477 (December 2018 version). See [FCC data](https://www.fcc.gov/form-477-county-data-internet-access-services) for more information. |\r\n| pp_total_raw | Per-pupil total expenditure (sum of local and federal expenditure) from Edunomics Lab's National Education Resource Database on Schools (NERD$) project. The expenditure data are school-by-school, and we use the median value to represent the expenditure of a given school district.

While 14% of all households with school-aged children don’t have internet at home, the percent increases by four percentage points to 18% for households in rural areas. The rural/urban internet divide is an issue of concern for governments. The US Department of Agriculture has invested in rural broadband for decades and the federal government announced the American Broadband Initiative in 2019.\r\n\r\nAccess also varies by race. For both internet and computers, white and Asian children have higher than average access, whereas Black, Hispanic, and American Indian and Native Alaskan children have lower than average access. Access is particularly low for American Indian and Native Alaskan children, with 65% with access to a computer and 63% with home internet.\r\n\r\nTechnology availability isn’t the only barrier to remote learning. Some children may not have access to a quiet place to learn; remote learning will be particularly difficult for the 1.5 million homeless students in the US. At present, there are no statistics on where children are living during coronavirus shutdowns. However, news outlets reported some children are staying outside their parental home with grandparents or other caretakers who may have slow speeds or no internet altogether. Lastly, the Department of Education is helping schools address remote learning challenges for students with disabilities.\r\n\r\nPolicies to expand universal home internet access may receive renewed attention in response to coronavirus shelter in place orders. In the meantime, some school districts are getting creative to provide access to digital learning. South Bend, Indiana is deploying buses as wifi hotspots and New York City is distributing 300,000 Apple iPads to students. Responses vary based on a school district’s ability to provide resources.\r\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<font

Evidences also reviewed by the researched that has emerged during the crisis on the multiple challenges that children, their teachers, schools, families, and communities face, all of which exacerbate opportunity gaps. Indeed, the evidence points to disparities in opportunities that exacerbate existing inequities and place major stress on low-income students and their teachers, in particular. Due to the digital divide and many other factors, these children are most likely to lose more substantial learning time. And their families are also most likely to experience compounded stresses—such as job loss, the loss of health care, the lack of paid sick leave, the lack of child care, and the need to work on site in “essential” jobs that put them at health risks: all these factors make it much harder for these families to attend to children who are suddenly home schooling and struggling with ad-hoc efforts at remote learning.\r\n\r\nThe lessons learned point to the need to enact an agenda that lifts up children and reduces educational inequities after the interruption to schooling due to the coronavirus is over. The agenda must also rebuild the system so that lifting up children and reducing inequities in education become the new norm. To accomplish this, we outline a three-stage response. The first stage is immediate relief for students and educators so they can function better , as remote learning continues in some form for many children. The second stage is significant short-term investments during the recovery that will enable students whose education was interrupted by the coronavirus crisis to catch up and continue their development. The third stage is longer-term reforms to rebuild the education system so that the challenges documented here are corrected and the system finally delivers an excellent, equitable education to all children.\r\n\r\nIn the rebuilding phase, it is essential to establish an education system that embraces a whole-child approach, addresses the impacts of poverty and inequality on students’ capacity to learn and on teachers’ abilities to do their jobs, offers a flexible set of wraparound supports to mitigate the impacts of the inequities that are built into the system, values education and educators, and creates viable contingency plans for future crises.\r\n\r\nIn closing, the ultimate consequences of the pandemic for K–12 education in the United States will indeed be a function of the quality, intensity, and comprehensiveness of our response to counter the pandemic’s negative lasting effects. Indeed, our call for relief, recovery, and reform has a historical precedent. As Darren Walker, president of the Ford Foundation, recently noted:\r\n\r\nThis societal reimagination certainly encompasses a reimagination of our education system. With the right vision, we can actually ensure that public education plays a critical role in restoring the human and social capital in our country and in readying us for the next challenges, big or small, that we may confront in the future. Our children and our future depend on it.","metadata":{}}]}

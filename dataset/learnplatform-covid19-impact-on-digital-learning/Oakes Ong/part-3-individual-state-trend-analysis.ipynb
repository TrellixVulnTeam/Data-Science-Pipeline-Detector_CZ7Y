Hence, we hypothesized that the trend reversal observed near the period July 2020 (Monthly Mean) and August 2020 (Monthly Median) may be due to differing practices by different states, especially for states with high districts frequencies in this dataset (namely Utah and California) which made it mandotory for students to access their learning remotely. Due to their high frequencies in the dataset provided, it results in a trend reveral. \n\nFrom the results obtain through this sample, it seems that there are insufficient evidence in supporting our hypothesis that <b><i>the difference in State practices had affected the trend starting from July 2020</i></b>. The trends above show similarity to the trend observed on the national level. Contrary to our expextation,even trends like the Massachuset, which we expect it to behave in a continuous declining trend based on our assumption and hypothesis, behaved in a similar manner to the trend observed on the national level. The only discrepancy observed from this sample to the national level trend, is the trend for the monthly mean occur only in August 2020 instead of July 2020. However, this discrepancy spotted is within our expectation since the pattern had already been picked up on the monthly median graph for the trend observed on national level.\n    \nAll in all, the results obtained suggest that the political factor (difffering practices amongst the States) may not be a cause for the increase in engagement of learning tools and digital platforms amongst the students in the United States. This still leave us the intriguing observation starting from the period August 2020. Deeper analysis may be needed to be done to find out the answer for this observation. Perhaps, engaging other features in the dataset may provide us with the answer we are looking for.....","metadata":{}}]}

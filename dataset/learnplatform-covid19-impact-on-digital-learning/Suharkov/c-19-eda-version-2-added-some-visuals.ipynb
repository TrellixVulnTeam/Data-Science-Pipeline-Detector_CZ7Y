The categories listed in this file are part of LearnPlatform's product taxonomy. Data were labeled by our team. Some products may not have labels due to being duplicate, lack of accurate url or other reasons.\n\n| Name  | Description |\n|:-----:|:-----------:|\n| LP ID | The unique identifier of the product |\n| URL   | Web Link to the specific product |\n| Product Name | Name of the specific product |\n| Provider/Company Name | Name of the product provider |\n| Sector(s) | Sector of education where the product is used |\n| Primary Essential Function | The basic function of the product. There are two layers of labels here. Products are first labeled as one of these three categories: 1. LC = Learning & Curriculum, 2. CM = Classroom Management, and 3. SDO = School & District Operations. Each of these categories have multiple sub-categories with which the products were labeled |\n\n#### District information data\nThe district file **districts_info.csv** includes information about the characteristics of school districts, including data from NCES (2018-19), FCC (Dec 2018), and Edunomics Lab. In this data set, we removed the identifiable information about the school districts. We also used an open source tool ARX (Prasser et al. 2020) to transform several data fields and reduce the risks of re-identification. For data generalization purposes some data points are released with a range where the actual value falls under. Additionally, there are many missing data marked as 'NaN' indicating that the data was suppressed to maximize anonymization of the dataset.\n\n| Name | Description |\n|:----:|:-----------:|\n| district_id |\tThe unique identifier of the school district |\n| state | The state where the district resides in |\n| locale | NCES locale classification that categorizes U.S. territory into four types of areas: City, Suburban, Town, and Rural.

See FCC data for more information |\n| pptotalraw | Per-pupil total expenditure (sum of local and federal expenditure) from Edunomics Lab's National Education Resource Database on Schools (NERD$) project. The expenditure data are school-by-school, and we use the median value to represent the expenditure of a given school district |\n\n#### Engagement data\nThe engagement data are aggregated at school district level, and each file in the folder **engagement_data** represents data from one school district.

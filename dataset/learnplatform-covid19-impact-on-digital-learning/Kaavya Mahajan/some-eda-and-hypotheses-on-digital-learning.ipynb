\n\nAlthough we analysed more products related to LC and CM than we did SDO, it is evident that school planning was the major utiliser of online platforms and resources to continue education, followed by classroom management, and then curriculum. I think this shows that the institutions were the ones who had to take up drastic changes, with rethinking the entire way of managing schedules, classes, clubs etc., then comes the teachers managing their classes, who had to go through monumental changes as well, but the change wasn't as drastic (probably becuase Google Classroom and things like that are already used in countries like America, not sure if this is true, ut I think it is), and finally the thing that changed the least is the curriculum, which is to be expected, as most teachers (atleast in my experience), continued to teach the same curriculum, only in the online mode.

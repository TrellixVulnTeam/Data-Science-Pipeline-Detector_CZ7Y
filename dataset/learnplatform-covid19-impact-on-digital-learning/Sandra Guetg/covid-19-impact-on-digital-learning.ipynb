In response to the fast spread of the desease, personal contacts were reduced to an absolute minimum and schools have been closed for extended periods of time, allowing the students to learn almost exclusively through digital learning. In this analysis I present some insight into the state of digital learning in 2020 in the United States and how digital learning depends on various factors.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Summary\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 on digital learning is extremely variable among products and districts. While the pandemic did not boost the average access rate, it lead to an increase in average student engagement. However, digital learning behaviour depends most on the product, then on the district and less than that, although not negligibly, on the pandemic. Therefore, it is important to look into individual products to investigate the influene of the pandemic as well as district characteristics. I looked into a number of products that were most widely used. From those products it becomes clear that virtual classroom learning as well as some individual learning platforms gained impact, whereas other learning platforms and, surprisingly cyber security lost impact. I found the video conference platform Zoom to be the big winner of the pandemic, which might partly be explained by its value to overcome social distancing in general next to its value for student-teacher contacts. \nOverall I do not find an impactful global dependency for digital learning on any of the district characteristics like state, amount of black or hispanic people, poverty or money invested in students. Rather, the information on digital learning behaviour contained in knowing the district is not present in any of the district characteristics alone. Digital learning being independent of distric characteristics is particularly true for many products when looking at the engagement of the fraction of students that did access digital learing products. In other words, students that used digital learning platforms were engaged similarly, independent of their sociocultural background, and got tendentially more engaged when the pandemic hit.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Loading and cleaning the data\nAs a first step, I look at the three datasets provided for analysis in this competition to get an overview and do some cleaning of the data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"path = '/kaggle/input/learnplatform-covid19-impact-on-digital-learning/'\nproducts = pd.read_csv(path + 'products_info.csv')\nproducts = products.astype({'LP ID': 'str'})\nproducts = products.rename({'LP ID': 'lp_id'}, axis=1)\nprint('Overview over the products data\\n')\nproducts.describe(include='all')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-29T08:27:12.199292Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-29T08:27:12.199759Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-29T08:27:12.303217Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-29T08:27:12.199725Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-29T08:27:12.302089Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"districts = pd.read_csv(path + 'districts_info.csv')\ndistricts = districts.astype({'district_id': 'str'})\nprint('Overview over the districts data\\n')\ndisplay(districts.describe(include='all'))\n\nprint(\"Values present for pct_black/hispanic and pct_free/reduced, respectively:\")\nprint(districts['pct_black/hispanic'].unique())\nprint(districts['pct_free/reduced'].unique())","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-29T08:27:12.305092Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-29T08:27:12.305448Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-29T08:27:12.354032Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-29T08:27:12.305414Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-29T08:27:12.353034Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Given that the county connections ratio in the districts dataset takes on only two values, one of them only one single time, there is too little information in the dataset to investigate any influence of this parameter on digital learning behaviour.

The time of school closure is marked by a darker background.\n\nThese plots show that there is a large variability in digital learning behaviour between school districts. Looking at the average, we can see from these plots that point access basically remained at the same level when the pandemic hit, dropped during summer break, recovered after the break but slowly decreased in fall. The engagement index, however, ramped up early in the year and remained at a higher level throughout the year, except for summer break (which was expected) and a slow decrease in fall. The engaged student engagement index jumped end of February and remained at a higher level throughout the year, even through summer break, however, it seems to be slightly lower during fall again. For all three measures, school closures did not appear to lead to more use of digital learning platforms. If anything, point access seems to be slightly lower during that time.\n\nThis suggests that when the pandemic hit, students that were already engaged in digital learning got more engaged, whereas students that did not use digital platforms prior to the pandemic did not start doing so after the pandemic hit, not even when schools were closed.\n\nI personally had hoped to find the oppisite, that students that used to learn in school independent of digital platforms would switch to digital learning when access to schools got restricted, indicating that they had continued their education. The above findings could mean that students not used to digital learning missed out on their eductation when they could not be in school. What is not covered by this data, however, are other means of compensating lack of school, like for example parents or private tutors teaching the students or learning material on paper given out by schools.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.catplot(data=engagement, x='weekday', y='engagement_index', hue='circumstances',\n           kind='bar', aspect=2/1, ci='sd');","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-29T08:34:56.928241Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-29T08:34:56.928837Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-29T08:36:32.098761Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-29T08:34:56.928777Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-29T08:36:32.097306Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.catplot(data=engagement, x='weekday', y='engagement_index', hue='circumstances',\n           kind='bar', aspect=2/1, ci=None);\nsns.catplot(data=engagement, x='weekday', y='pct_access', hue='circumstances',\n           kind='bar', aspect=2/1, ci=None);\nsns.catplot(data=engagement, x='weekday', y='eng_stud_engagement_index', hue='circumstances',\n           kind='bar', aspect=2/1, ci=None);","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-29T08:36:32.101027Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-29T08:36:32.101652Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-29T08:41:11.151347Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-29T08:36:32.101467Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-29T08:41:11.150384Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Looking at the data broken down by weekday for the various circumstances (pre-corona, corona, break times) there is a huge standard deviation among districts and/or products (note that here in contrast to the previous plots data has not been averaged over products for each district). \n\nOn average, the engagement index clearly increased on all weekdays when the pandemic hit as compared to the time before corona.

Also here, spring break had much less of an impact than summer break.\n\nInterestingly, the increase of the engaged student engagement index due to the pandemic is much less pronounced than the engagement index overall and especially shows that engaged students stayed engaged also during summer break. This finding somewhat contradicts the intuitive expectation resulting from looking at the ratio between average engagement and average point access that the increase in engagement would be more pronounced here, but this can be easily explained mathematically by the fact that the ratio of averages is not the same as the average of ratios, especially in situations with high variability.","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-16T06:17:35.010189Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-16T06:17:35.010651Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-16T06:20:35.667113Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-16T06:17:35.010605Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-16T06:20:35.665919Z"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Which products have been used and how was this influenced by the pandemic?\n\nThere are more than 1000 products in the engagement dataset, however, average point access rates have been found to be below 1 percent.

Digital learning behaviour depends most on the product, then on the district and less than that, although certainly not negligibly, on the pandemic. Access rates had not been boosted consistently when the pandemic hit, but rather there was a shift from some products towards others, which averaged out overall. Overall engagement increased in response to the pandemic and for almost all investigated products engagement of engaged students clearly increased when the pandemic hit, independent of district properties. Interestingly, while state ordered school closures seemed to have little influence (on top of the pandemic situation), in terms of digital learning spring break did not happen in 2020, except for a slightly longer weekend. Possibly this results from schools beeing closed anyhow during this time, so the break ceased being special for the students.\n\nThere are only a few products that are widely used and only 5 that stand out with very high engagement indices. Virtual classroom learning clearly became more important during the pandemic, reflecting the situation that students had limited (physical) access to schools. Surprisingly, Securly Anywhere Filter lost impact when the pandemic hit, suggesting that students got somewhat more relaxed about cyber security. This also seems true for districts with more black or hispanic people. While students lost interest in the learning game platform Kahoot!, they gained interest in the individual learning platform ST Math, which is also most popular among districts with high percent free or reduced price lunches (low income). The biggest winner of the pandemic is clearly the video conference platfrom Zoom. Even though Zoom didn't have a breakthrough in all states, where it did it experienced a hugh boost from almost nothing to being one of the most highly used products in digital learning. Part of this boost probably originates not from learning behaviour, but from people connecting virtually in times of social distancing.\n\nOverall I do not find a global dependency for digital learning on any of the district characteristics like state, amount of black or hispanic people, poverty or money invested in students. Rather, the information contained in knowing the district is not present in any of the district characteristics alone. Either, it's some combination of those characteristics which is important for digital learning, or there are relevant properties not covered by the dataset, like for example more or less motivated and engaged people (towards digital learning) in relevant positions in the school district. A more thorough analysis of school districts with high access rates compared to school districts with low access rates would be necessary to investigate what they had been doing right to achieve such digital learning behaviour.\n","metadata":{}}]}

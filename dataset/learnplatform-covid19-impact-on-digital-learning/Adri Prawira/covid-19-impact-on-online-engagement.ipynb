Time series chart shows that there are slight increase of **access percentage** and **engagement index** from March 2020 - April 2020 but gradually decreased until July 2020, and after that both parameter increased again. Therefore, the online learning platform use is actually increasing during the pandemic in 2020, but there is an very low access and engagement period that needed to be researched further to understand the factor of that period.\n\n2. **The most accessed** (the most amount of students that access the platform) and **the most engaged** (the most amount of page-load events per one thousand students)online learning platform are the one that is used in **Corporate Sector**.\n\n3. **The most accessed online learning platforms** are the platforms which Primary Essential Function is for **School Management Software - Mobile Device Management**, followed by general **School Management Software**. Meanwhile, **the most engaged online learning platforms** are the platforms which Primary Essential Function is for **Learning Management System**, followed by **School Management Software - Mobile Device Management**.\n\n4. The highest access percentage and engagement index occurred in Rural Area, where the highest value is in North Dakota. The second highest access percentage and engagement occured in City Locale of New York.\n\n5. The access percentage and the engagement index of high connectivity ratio (1.5) is **significantly higher** than the values of low connectivity ratio (0.59). This means that the more amount of at least 200kbps internet connection in a county is, the more online learning platforms are used.\n\n6. The highest access percentage and engagement index occured at districts that have **expenditures 20000 - 22000 per pupil** in the **Rural Area**. Meanwhile, in the **City Area**, the highest access percentage and engagment index occured at districts that have **expenditures 6000 - 8000 per pupil**.\n\n7. In general, the highest access percentage and engagement index occured at districts that have the least amount of Black/Hispanic people.\n\n8. In **Rural Area**, the highest access percentage and engagement index occured at districts that have the **least amount of Black/Hispanic people**. Meanwhile in **City Area**, the highest access percentage and engagement index occured at districts that have the **most amount of Black/Hispanic people**.\n\n9. There are technological/digital access difference in racial context (Black/Hispanic people and non-Black/Hispanic) between City and Rural area.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}

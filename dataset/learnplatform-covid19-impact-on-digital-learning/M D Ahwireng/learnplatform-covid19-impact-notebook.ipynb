Between the periods of January and the end of February the usage for LC products alternated between 1500 and 2100. This period precedes the closure of schools during the spring (March, April, May).\nDuring the Spring Period there was an increment in usage relative to the period from January to the end of February. The usage ranged between 1500 and 3000 with April recording usage between 1800 and 2200.\nThere was a declined in usage from June to August. This period recorded the lowest usage all year with values ranging between 900 and 1200. August to December saw a rise in usage. There was a steep rise from August to September. The highest usage values were recorded between August and December.\nThe usage of CM and SDO product types were generally at par. The trends mirrored that of the LC types but with a lower usage. The usage for the two did not exceed 500.\nSDO type was having slightly more usage than CM from January to march. CM usage caught up with SDO usage from April to September beyond which it gained slightly more usage than SDO.\n### Locales\nThe plot of the **Suburbs** mirrors the plot for the state. This indicates that the suburb districts are the major driving force of the usage in the state. The usage of LC peaks at 2700. That of CM and SDO both peaks at an approximate value of 400\nThe **rural** districts also mirror the trends of the state in general but have LC usage peaking at 600 and both CM and SDO at approximately 100\nThe trends in the **town** districts are a little bit different. Data for the usage starts from March 2020 to January 2021. The usage difference between LC and the other types is much closer than what is observed in the other locales. The profile (horizontal trends) follows that of the state. The usage of LC peaks at approximately 75. That of CM and SDO both peaks at approximately 10.\n\n## The covid effect\nFrom the trends before the closure and during the closure of schools indicates increment in the use of products during the closure period. As expected, Covid increased the usage of products in the state of Illinois and further implies greater reach through products.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plot_viz(state=states[1], slice_col=slice1, about='Product Type Usage') \nplot_viz(state=states[1], slice_col=['engagement_index'], about='Engagement')\nplot_top(state=states[1], slice_col=['Product Name'],top=10, about='Specific Product Usage')\nplot_top(state=states[1], slice_col=['Provider/Company Name'],top=10, about='Specific Product Providers')","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## State of Utah\nLC products were the most used in the state. There was a steady rise in usage from January to April. Usage ranged between 800 and 3600 from January to April. March, Aprol and May also recorded a steady rise with localised decline in April. The usage in this period ranged between 1800 and 3900.\nThere was a steady decline from May to June and a very steep decline from May to June. The lowest usage (700)   was recorded from July to August. The usage remained stable at low values from July to August with values ranging between 700 and 1100. \nA steep rise was recorded from August to September and a gentle rise from September to October. There was a drop in usage in the middle of September followed by a rise which led to the highest usage all year in October. In general, the usage from September to December was the highest. \nSDO was the second most used product type from January to April. April to May saw CM catching up with SDO usage and doing slightly better from May to June. Between June to August where the usage of both products declined and remained generally the same. From August to September, there was a rise in usage of SDO and CM. In the remaining months in the year, CM performed better than SDO.\n### Locales\nThere was data for districts in Towns, Cities, Rurals and Suburbs.\nThe product usage in **cities** followed the trends seen in the state. LC peaked at 500, CM and SDO both peaked at 80. The lowest usage of LC was about 20 which is less than the highest usage of CM and SDO. This trend was not seen in the state.\nThe product usage in **towns** followed the trends seen in the state. LC peaked at 1100, CM and SDO both peaked at 160. The lowest usage of LC was about 80 which is less than the highest usage of CM and SDO. This trend was not seen in the state.\nThe product usage in **rurals** followed the trends seen in the state. LC peaked at 275, CM and SDO both peaked at 45. The lowest usage of LC was about 0 which coincided with the lowest usage of CM and SDO. This trend was not seen in the state.\nThe product usage in **suburbs** followed the trends seen in the state.

Learners build knowledge as they explore the world around them, observe and interact with phenomena, converse and engage with others, and make connections between new ideas and prior understandings.\n\n- Builds on prior knowledge - and involves enriching, building on, and changing existing understanding, where “one’s knowledge base is a scaffold that supports the construction of all future learning” (Alexander, 1996, p. 89).  \n\n- Occurs in a complex social environment - and thus should not be limited to being examined or perceived as something that happens on an individual level. Instead, it is necessary to think of learning as a social activity involving people, the things they use, the words they speak, the cultural context they’re in, and the actions they take (Bransford, et al., 2006; Rogoff, 1998), and that knowledge is built by members in the activity (Scardamalia & Bereiter, 2006).\n\n- Is situated in an authentic context - provides learners with the opportunity to engage with specific ideas and concepts on a need-to-know or want-to-know basis (Greeno, 2006; Kolodner, 2006).\n\n- Requires learners’ motivation and cognitive engagement to be sustained when learning complex ideas, because considerable mental effort and persistence are necessary.\n\nThe conditions for inputs to learning are clear, but the process is incomplete without making sense of what outputs constitute learning has taken place. At the core, learning is a process that results in a change in knowledge or behavior as a result of experience. Understanding what it takes to get that knowledge in and out (or promote behavioral change of a specific kind) can help optimize learning.\n    \n</font>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Successful Online learning stories\n\n<font size=4>\n    \n## 1. Khan Academy\n\n### History\n    \nThe organization started in 2006 when Salman \"Sal\" Khan tutored one of his cousins in mathematics on the Internet using a service called Yahoo! Doodle Images. After a while, Khan's other cousins began to use his tutoring service. Due to the demand, Khan decided to make his videos watchable on the Internet, so he published his content on YouTube. Later, he used a drawing application called SmoothDraw and now uses a Wacom tablet to draw using ArtRage. The video tutorials were recorded on his computer.\n\nPositive responses prompted Khan to quit his job in 2009, to focus full-time on creating educational tutorials (then released under the name Khan Academy). Khan Lab School, a school founded by Sal Khan and associated with Khan Academy, opened on September 15, 2014, in Mountain View, California. In June 2017, Khan Academy officially launched the Financial Literacy Video Series for college graduates, job seekers, and young professionals.\n    \n### Funding\n    \nKhan Academy is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization, mostly funded by donations coming from philanthropic organizations. \n1. In 2010, Google donated 2 million dollar for creating new courses and translating content into other languages, as part of their Project 10100 program.\n    \n2. In 2013, Carlos Slim from the Luis Alcazar Foundation in Mexico made a donation for creating Spanish versions of videos.\n    \n3. In 2015, AT&T contributed 2.25 million dollar to Khan Academy for mobile versions of the content accessible through apps.\n    \n4. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has donated 1.5 million dollar to Khan Academy.\n    \n5. On January 11, 2021, Elon Musk donated 5 million dollar through his Musk foundation.\n    \n### Content\n\nKhan Academy's website aims to provide a free personalized learning experience, mainly built on the videos which are hosted on YouTube. The website is meant to be used as a supplement to its videos, because it includes other features such as progress tracking, practice exercises, and teaching tools. The material can also be accessed through mobile applications.\n\nThe videos display a recording of drawings on an electronic blackboard, which is similar to the style of a teacher giving a lecture. The narrator describes each drawing and how they relate to the material being taught. Furthermore, throughout the lessons, users can earn badges and energy points, which can be displayed on their profiles. Non-profit groups have distributed offline versions of the videos to rural areas in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. Videos range from all subjects covered in school and for all grades from kindergarten up through the high school. The Khan Academy website also hosts content from educational YouTube channels and organizations such as Crash Course and the Museum of Modern Art. It also provides online courses for preparing for standardized tests, including the SAT, AP Chemistry, Praxis Core and MCAT and released LSAT preparation lessons in 2018. They also have a collaboration with independent chemists, which are mentioned in their, \"Meet the chemistry professional\". Khan Academy has also supported Code.org’s Hour of Code, providing coding lessons on its website.\n\nIn July 2017, Khan Academy became the official practice partner for the College Board's Advanced Placement.\n    \n\n## 2. Coursera\n    \n### History\n    \nCoursera was founded in 2012 by Stanford University computer science professors Andrew Ng and Daphne Koller. Ng and Koller started offering their Stanford courses online in fall 2011, and soon after left Stanford to launch Coursera. Princeton, Stanford, the University of Michigan and the University of Pennsylvania were the first universities to offer content on the platform. Offerings have since expanded to include Specializations – collections of courses that build skills in a specific subject – as well as degrees and a workforce development product for businesses and government organizations.\n    \n### Finance and Fund\n    \nCoursera's revenues rose from 184 million dollar in 2019 to 294 million dollar in 2020. To date, Coursera has not made a profit. The company lost 66 million dollar in 2020 as it ramped up marketing and advertising.\n\nFor the first quarter in 2021, Coursera reported revenue of 88.4 million, up 64% from a year earlier, with a net loss of 18.7 million, or 13.4 million on a non-GAAP basis.  Coursera said consumer revenue was 51.9 million, up 61% , while enterprise revenue was 24.5 million, up 63%, and degree programs had revenue of 12 million, up 81%. \n\nThe startup raised an initial 16 million dollar funding round backed by Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers and New Enterprise Associates. In 2013, GSV led the Series B investment, which totaled 63 million. In 2015, NEA led the Series C round of venture funding, which totaled more than 60 million. In 2017, the company raised 64 million from its existing investors in Series D round of funding. In 2019, the company raised 103 million in Series E round of funding from the SEEK Group, Future Fund and NEA. The company reached valuation of 1 billion+ in 2019. In July 2020, the company announced it had raised 130 million in Series F funding and updating its valuation to 2.5 billion.\n\n    \n### Product and Services\n    \n#### Courses\n    \nCoursera courses last approximately four to twelve weeks, with one to two hours of video lectures a week. These courses provide quizzes, weekly exercises, peer-graded and reviewed assignments, an optional Honors assignment, and sometimes a final project or exam to complete the course. Courses are also provided on-demand, in which case users can take their time in completing the course with all of the material available at once. As of May 2015, Coursera offered 104 on-demand courses it also provides guided projects which are short 2-3 hour projects that can be done. And it can be done at home.\n\nAccording to 'Coursera Impact Report 2020', the top five most popular courses that people learn from Coursera were contact tracing, digital marketing, project management, Python programming, and social psychology.\n    \n#### Degrees\n\nAs of 2017, Coursera offers full master's degrees. They first started with Master's in Innovation and Entrepreneurship (OMIE) from HEC Paris and Master's of Accounting (iMSA) from the University of Illinois, but have moved on to offer Master of Computer Science in Data Science and Master of Business Administration (iMBA), both from University of Illinois. Also as part of MBA; there are some courses are offered separately and will be included in the curriculum of MBA when being enrolled in like digital marketing courses.\n    \n#### Professional Certificates\n    \nGoogle, IDM, Facebook and others well-known companies launched various Professional courses for professional certificates. To generate workforce for the sector like IT support, Digital marketing, UX design, project management, Data Analysis, Data science and more. According to Google, their courses are equivalent to 4 years degrees. They also offered 10,000 scholarships Google and it's 20+ partners will accept those certificates as 4-year degree equivalent.    \n    \n#### Covid-19 Impact on Coursera\n    \nIn 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Coursera launched a course by the Jameel Institute at Imperial College London. Called \"Science Matters: Let's Talk About COVID-19\", the course was the most popular launched on Coursera in 2020, with over 130,000 enrolled learners that year. The course was presented by Jameel Institute research lead Professor Helen Ward and deputy director Dr Katharina Hauck, with specific modules in collaboration with other researchers from across Imperial.\n    \n    \n## How did COVID-19 impact education, and more specifically Digital Education!\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created the largest disruption of education systems in human history, affecting nearly 1.6 billion learners in more than 200 countries. Closures of schools, institutions and other learning spaces have impacted more than 94% of the world’s student population. This has brought far-reaching changes in all aspects of our lives. Social distancing and restrictive movement policies have significantly disturbed traditional educational practices. Reopening of schools after relaxation of restriction is another challenge with many new standard operating procedures put in place.\n\nWithin a short span of the COVID-19 pandemic, many researchers have shared their works on teaching and learning in different ways. Several schools, colleges and universities have discontinued face-to-face teachings. There is a fear of losing 2020 academic year or even more in the coming future. The need of the hour is to innovate and implement alternative educational system and assessment strategies. The COVID-19 pandemic has provided us with an opportunity to pave the way for introducing digital learning. This kernel aims to provide a comprehensive report on the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on online teaching and learning of various papers and indicate the way forward.\n    \n## Important Fact\n    \n\"Internet users ranged from over 95% to less than 70% of the adult population in 2019, and there are important demographic differences in Internet use. Although 58% of those aged 50-74 used the Internet daily in 2019 – up from only 30% in 2010 – this remains well below the average share of daily Internet users aged 16-24 (the so-called “digital natives”), which was close to 95%.\"\n\n\"There are also persistent skills gaps across demographic groups and countries, with people of higher skill or income levels making better use of the Internet and online activities, and being better able to access knowledge, job opportunities, and health and education services.\"    \n    \n    \n    \n    ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Challenge Descripton \n\n<font size=4>\nNelson Mandela believed education was the most powerful weapon to change the world.

Effective policies and plans need to be enacted in order to make education more equitable—and perhaps your innovative data analysis will help reveal the solution.\n\nCurrent research shows educational outcomes are far from equitable. The imbalance was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. There's an urgent need to better understand and measure the scope and impact of the pandemic on these inequities.\n\nEducation technology company LearnPlatform was founded in 2014 with a mission to expand equitable access to education technology for all students and teachers. LearnPlatform’s comprehensive edtech effectiveness system is used by districts and states to continuously improve the safety, equity, and effectiveness of their educational technology. LearnPlatform does so by generating an evidence basis for what’s working and enacting it to benefit students, teachers, and budgets.\n\nIn this analytics competition, you’ll work to uncover trends in digital learning.

In the words of one report, the pandemic  \"wreaked  havoc  on  children’s  educational  experiences.\"  (Hamilton  et  al.  2020).\n\n<font size=+1>This disruption most severely impacted students with less access to  digital devices and internet connectivity at home compared to their peers. Specifically, the \"Homework Gap\", or the greater struggle such students already experienced with online assignments, morphed into a full-blown education gap, whereby those same students had less access to education generally.\n\n<font size=+1>The crisis was serious, severe, and widespread. According to surveys,  \"Nationwide, just 9 percent of teachers reported that nearly all of  their  students  regularly  completed  distance  learning  activities, and most teachers reported that no more than half of  students  did  so\" and \"just under half of parents agreed that their children spent less time on schoolwork and learned less during the spring 2020 shutdown than  they  would  have  in  a  typical  session  of  in-person schooling.\"  (Hamilton  et  al.  2020).</font> \n\n<font size=+1>As might be expected, during this time, educational experts and researchers ramped up their focus on understanding the digital education gap and on identifying factors that influence and may address it. Using a variety of data sources, but especially data provided by the education technology company LearnPlatform, this report sets out to contribute to this effort.</font> \n\n<font size=+1>Engagement with learning, digital or otherwise, is a complex,  multi-faceted, and somewhat elusive concept -- according to the educational software company GoGuardian, when teachers and administrators are asked to define this term, the typical answer is along the lines of \"I know it when I see it\". (Aguilar, Sheldon, et. al. 2020). However, as explained in more detail in the next section, LearnPlatform has devised a method of operationally defining digital learning engagement within school districts, by quantifying page-load events for specific educational technology products in a given day.</font>  \n\n<font size=+1>This report will examine the relationship between these measures and a number of factors, including changes in engagement over time; demographic markers, based on district information in the LearnPlatform data set; and state-specific data from a variety of sources, aggregating results from district- to  state-level. The report is divided into three parts:\n</font> \n    \n<font size=+1>1. Explanation of the LearnPlatform measures of digital engagement and the other data LearnPlatform provides.</font>\n    \n<font size=+1>2. A review of factors associated with digital engagement levels, including changes over time, demographic factors, geography, and spending levels; this review will be based primarily on district level data.</font>\n    \n<font size=+1>3. A review of state-level data to a) identify policies, specifically related to education, that may increase, or fail to increase, digital engagement, and b) the association between engagement and distal state factors, such as interventions intended to mitigate pandemic-caused health and economic insecurity as opposed to those specifically geared towards education. </font> \n\n\n\n

size=+1>According to Domina and Renzulli et. al. (2021), \"because a better mood at home and in other nonschool environments  is  associated  with  greater  engagement...family  stressors,  such  as  worries  associated  with  job  security,  home  schooling,  and  health,  are  likely  to  complicate  traditional engagement levels.\" The above correlations are consistent with this observation; all of them except perhaps for the one relating to face mask mandates are directly related to health and economic security.\n\n<font size=+1>Banning Eviction Initiation and Utility Shutoff in 2020 was positively correlated with engagement, as was being a state that accepted Medicaid Expansion--this does not seem surprising as being homeless, having no light or heat at home, or lacking medical insurance are not exactly situations conducive to focusing on school work. The pandemic resulted in widespread decreases in economic security, and these results suggest that state action to mitigate this crisis helped in numerous ways, as they were not directly intended to increase student focus on their remote learning.</font> \n\n<font size=+1>Two characteristics, Percent of Children Without Health Insurance and Percent of Adults Who Don't See Doctors Due to Cost, are negatively correlated with  engagement scores. These two variables are both measures of economic and health insecurity.</font> \n\n<font size=+1>Interestingly, five variables related to flu vaccinations correlate with engagement. On the one hand, flu vaccination rates could be a correlate of general health; on the other hand, flu vaccines generally do not have a high rate of efficacy in preventing flu.<sup>7</sup> In 2021, the controversy over the COVID vaccine demonstrated that attitudes towards vaccines are associated with a wide range of beliefs, behaviors, and outcomes. If these vaccination rates reflect attitudes more than physical health, their correlation with digital educational engagement scores could reflect a more complex phenomenon.</font>\n\n<font size=+1>Overall these correlations suggest good health, access to healthcare, economic security, and living in a state with policies reflecting an ethic of care are important predictors of childhood educational engagement.</font> \n\n<font size=-1><sup>7</sup>The efficacy rate is 40-60% according to the CDC (2021)</font>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# V. Conclusion\n\n<font size=+1>In this report, we reviewed data collected during the COVID-19 pandemic from the LearnPlatform Chrome extension measuring engagement in remote/digital education. We've acknowledged  that this data has numerous limitations; to mitigate this issue, we have combined most of our findings with corresponding research and expertise in the academic literature on educational engagement. None of our findings are conclusive but many of them suggest possible avenues for further study.</font>\n\n<font size=+1>In accord with the literature, we identified student populations that on the average experienced in gaps in engagement, including those that lack adequate technology and connectivity at home, people of color, the economically disadvantaged, and those who attend underfunded schools. Others have identified additional populations subject to the same, including LGBTQ students and the disabled, who suffered due to pandemic-related disruptions in mental-health services and other support systems. (U.S. Department of Education, Office of Civil Rights, 2021).</font>\n\n<font size=+1>However, the story was not always a simple one of advantaged groups thriving and vulnerable groups suffering. Some of the more interesting results we reported include:\n<ul>\n<li><font size=+1>Higher negative correlations with engagement scores for survey responses indicating that devices and connectivity are \"sometimes available\", compared to the response \"never available.\"</font>\n<li><font size=+1>In underfunded schools, we observed less evidence of a gap in engagement for people of color and the economically disadvantaged than in adequately funded schools.</font>\n<li><font size=+1>The well-documented gap in engagement in rural vs. urban/suburban locales might be mediated by ethnicity/economic status, whereby wealthier Caucasians living in rural areas are not as affected.</font>\n<li><font size=+1>Strong correlations between multiple measures of state flu vaccination rates and state levels of online educational engagement, which we speculated might be related to a mediating factor representing a more complex societal phenomenon.</font>\n</ul>\n\n<font size=+1>We found that engagement improved over time during the pandemic, for all groups studied but not necessarily to the same degree across all groups on all measures. This was not an experimental study, so we cannot assess the degree to which these changes had to do with interventions aimed at improving engagement vs. student adjustment occurring naturally over time. But, with support from the literature we reviewed, we assumed that specific state actions played a large role, and we used the data to help identify the most constructive actions. </font>\n    \n<font size=+1>We found support for previous findings that states must take specific actions, and oversee and monitor district intervention, as opposed to merely issuing recommendations and taking a laissez-faire approach. Our analysis also suggested that they must identify and focus specifically on the worst educational outcomes of the pandemic, such as learning loss.</font>\n    \n<font size=+1>The COVID-19 pandemic may have been the first widespread disruption forcing children around the world to transition to remote education, but it likely will not be the last. More pandemics, climate change, or another disaster we have not envisioned might lead to the same situation. Even barring such events, engagement in digital education will assume increasing importance over time as more homework and school assignments shift to  virtual platforms.</font>\n    \n<font size=+1>Therefore, in order to avoid exacerbating historical inequities in education (which contribute to historical inequities in housing, employment, and incarceration rates), state and local governments cannot blithely ignore this crisis; they should leverage data in order to learn and apply best practices. We hope reviews such as the present one can contribute to this goal.<font>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# VI.

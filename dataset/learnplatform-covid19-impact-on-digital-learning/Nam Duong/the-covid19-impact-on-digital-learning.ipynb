So why do I say \"widen\"? Before the onset of the novel pandemic, there was a significant digital divide between students with and without access to high-speed internet, appropriate devices for learning such as tablets, computers. There is also a distance between high-income and low-income households so that many other factors can be considered, like geography, race/ethnicity, etc. A new analysis by Common Sense and BCG finds that the \"gap\" has changed negatively. Its gap is more significant than previously understood. These inequities are an incentive for me to participate in this competition [LearnPlatform](https://www.kaggle.com/c/learnplatform-covid19-impact-on-digital-learning/) to find insights that can be useful to suggest some policies or come up with some creative ideas for narrowing the gap and moving forward to equity in distance learning.\n\nMy report contains the following sections:\n *  **Introduction**\n *  **Summarize Key Findings & Recommend Policies**\n *  **Data Source & Data Structure**\n *  **EDA & Storytelling Analytics**\n *  **Conclusion**\n\nThank you and happy reading!\n\nNam Duong \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Introduction\n\n## Background\nBefore the pandemic appeared, at that time, the education sector was more focused on face-to-face learning than on distance learning. Then suddenly, everything changed. The appearance of a novel contagious virus worldwide forced governments to close education institutions in more than 130 countries, which affected more than one billion students. Schools drive more than 56 million students to transition to full-time distance learning from home in nearly all the US. To prevent classroom disruption, schools and teachers have attempted to reach students remotely through distance learning tools and digital platforms.\n\nThe expanding use of technology in both homework and distance learning caused a crisis inequity in accessing digital education, which affected students and teachers, described as the \"digital divide.\" While nationwide, 99% of public schools have high-speed broadband access, this is not true for households. Many challenges to face when distance learning from home. One study project that learning disruption without the internet and learning devices leads to increased learning loss among America's most vulnerable learners. In this case, closing the digital divide is more critical than ever, which is long-term benefits when other crises occur in the future.\n\n## Main Points\nTo support a better understanding of digital learning during the Covid-19 pandemic and the term \"digital divide.\" I will walk you through the following main points:\n\n- First, I describe the picture of digital learning connectivity and engagement in 2020, how this evolves in the future, the change of types of education technology over the course, etc. \n- Second, I focus on the picture of the digital distance learning divide for student segment and state-level to explore the term means. Then, answer questions about the root cause of divide, investigate infrastructure conditions, access challenges, divide in student segment & state-level, etc.\n- Third, I characterize problem by demographic (race/ethnicity, income, etc.) and geography (rural,..., urban)\n- Fourth, I go to technical requirements for learning from home to identify technological specifications for connectivity and devices, as well as non-technological but impact on successful distance learning.\n- Fifth, I mention how to close the digital divide in the US.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Summarize Key Findings & Recommend Policies\n\n## Key Findings\n\n*Digital Learning Connectivity And Engagement In 2020*\n* Most states across the US driving students to transition to full-time distance learning from home.\n* During the Covid-19 pandemic, Edtech start-up funding raised considerably, and the interest in Edtech products.\n* Online learning has its advantages promised to become and evolve in the future, mainly when other crises occur.\n* Edtech products aim to PreK-12 students the most, followed by high-school or GDE... \n* Type of primary functions is the vital factor for choosing educational products.\n* Google LLC is still a giant Edtech company with various educational products used for lots of purposes such as Google Docs, Google Meet, Google Classroom, etc... Other products such as Zoom, Canvas, Youtube, Classlink, etc., also attract many students.\n* There is a significant difference in the percent of access as well as engagement index by state\n* The popularity of one product in one state does not mean in all states. Depends on many factors like demographics, characteristics..., products will be chosen and used differently.\n* In another field such as free/reduced lunch, black/Hispanic percent in school districts, internet access ratio differs depending on locale, state, race, etc.\n\n*Digital Divide Matter*\n* Before the onset of a pandemic, the digital divide existed. Still, the speed of the digital gap among students increased considerably and seriously during the pandemic, threatening the dropout rate and loss of learning progress.\n* Digital divide impacts many fields, not only education but also economic, living conditions, society, etc., so it's an urgent matter.\n* What we receive from closing the digital divide is incentive promoting us, policymakers, and the government takes action.\n* Three leading root causes of the digital divide: lack of availability, lack of affordability, lack of adoption. To solve the digital divide, we must solve these three causes.\n* Digital divide leads to dividing students with or without internet access and adequate devices for learning from home.\n* Other problems should be considered, such as the teacher gap in technology and noticeable trends in 2020.\n\n*Digital Divide In Different Demographics*\n* Students in low-income households are less likely to access the internet or own appropriate devices for distance learning.\n* Students who live in rural areas tend to suffer more poor conditions than other areas, so the rate of students with internet or devices is also lowest.\n* White and Asian children with internet access are higher than the average rate of internet access. In contrast, Black and Hispanic are nearly average, and American Indian and Native Alaskan children are lower than that.\n\n## Recommend Policies (Any creative and practical solutions are welcome)\n\n* Promoting program about widening internet network which everyone could access. \n* Researching breakthrough technology in internet connection. \n* Launching policies for attracting telecommunications companies' investment in internet services & infrastructure. \n* Decreasing the cost of the internet. \n* Holding a meeting among telecommunication companies to talk about customer care and purchase preference policy. \n* Driving customer benefits policies toward the most vulnerable.\n* Allowing for transparency in pricing and encourage bulk-purchasing efforts of devices & computers by states and districts.\n* Raising awareness of low-cost broadband service offerings and broadband service cost-support programs. \n* Governors must be committed to creating the most favorable conditions for maintaining the necessary supply chain in the short term to solve the gap during Covid-19. \n* Government funds should be invested more in that industry and considering chip manufacturing industry is a basis which other manufacturers rely upon. \n* Addressing parent's potential lack of trust and skepticism of technology solutions.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import related libraries \nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport os, glob\nimport plotly.express as px\nfrom plotly.offline import plot, iplot, init_notebook_mode\ninit_notebook_mode(connected=True)\n# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker- load\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session as px","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-01T12:02:49.56373Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-01T12:02:49.564143Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-01T12:02:53.063578Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-01T12:02:49.564058Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-01T12:02:53.06277Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Source & Data Structure\n\n## Data Source\n- Data provided by host: learnplatform-covid19-impact-data\n- External Data: National Telecommunications and Information Administration, US Census Bureau, US Deparment of Education, Pew Research Center, BroadBandNow, American Community Survey (ACS), USAfacts, etc\n\n## Data Structure\n- For more information learnplatform-data.

This most disruptive year to schools and society proved lucrative for the education industry, particularly for those raising private capital. In 2020, U.S. education technology startups raised over \\\\$2.2 billion in venture and private equity capital across 130 deals, according to the EdSurge ed-tech funding database. That's a nearly 30 percent increase from the \\\\$1.7 billion invested in 2019, which was spread across 105 deals, according to [EdSurge](https://www.edsurge.com/news/2021-01-13-a-record-year-amid-a-pandemic-us-edtech-raises-2-2-billion-in-2020).\n\nThe \\\\$2.2 billion marks the highest investment total in a single year for the U.S. tech industry. It's not an anomaly because a [report from C.B. Insights](https://www.cbinsights.com/reports/CB-Insights_MoneyTree-Q4-2020-Headline.pdf) showed that investments for all venture-backed U.S. companies reached a record \\\\$130 billion in 2020 or up 14 percent from 2019.\n\n\n**The Future: Physical vs. Online**\n\nA few datasets from the U.S. Department of Education, however, reveal a shift to online education. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, 21% of public schools offered at least one course entirely online during the 2017-2018 school year. At that time, only 5.7% provided a majority of all classes online.\\\nIn a 2019 report, 85% of district administrators said using digital learning resources was a high priority. Even 79% of district administrators said they provide a range of these programs. The 2020-2021 school year, at least during the pandemic, changed how most children learn. Government data in the coming years could show whether that impact is temporary or longer-lasting.\\\nBut anyway, Covid-19 has altered the landscape of education. Even large universities are adopting e-learning and thus, in turn, saving on investment in more physical infrastructure. This is also making education more flexible, accessible, and affordable.

Google LLC was known as an American multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products, founded in 1998. According to a newspaper article \"How Google Take Over The Classroom\" in The New York Times, more than half the nation’s primary- and secondary school students — more than 30 million children — use Google education apps, the company says. This explained that Google has the most various products that meet the needs of both students & teachers, which open a new educational ecosystem era for Google LLC. Although Microsoft, along with some companies - Adobe Inc, Learning A-Z-fell farther and farther behind Google in various products, they still have their signature and favorite products such as Microsoft 365 Education, OneNote, Teams, Etc.\n\nAbout primary essential functions that products provide, there are differences among levels of education. In an overview, a digital learning platform, or DEP for short, is the most popular essential function many products provide. As the name suggests, a DEP is an online ‘environment’ comprising applications and tools for the education sector. It is used by teachers, administrative staff, and students – and is explicitly designed to accelerate digital teaching and learning for schools. In short, these platforms are a collection of software and tools that all work together for education organizations and professionals – and the communities they serve. Microsoft Office 365 Education or Google's G Suite for Education is a marvelous example of DEP. Besides, some popular essential functions can be mentioned, such as Sites-Resources & Reference, Games & Simulation, Study Tools, Courseware & Textbooks. These functions are a great addition to students for self-study. PreK-12, the DEP is the most popular in a particular sector, followed by Sites-Resources & Reference, Games & Simulation... In higher education, DEP is not the most but Study tools, appropriately, this can be explained that students in higher education, where subjects are studied at an advanced level, focus on self-study ability so that they tend to need more study tools to support in their homework, researches or even personal projects than lower education. At a corporate level, the essential function is Content Creation & Curation. We can conclude that the change of popular primary essential functions depends on the goal of each educational level or corporate aim.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#save row with nan values to private data frame which may be used later\r\ndistrict_info_anonymous = districts_info[districts_info['state'].isna() | districts_info['locale'].isna() | districts_info['pct_black/hispanic'].isna() \r\n                                         |districts_info['pct_free/reduced'].isna() | districts_info['county_connections_ratio'].isna() | districts_info['pp_total_raw'].isna()]\r\n# save complete data frame \r\ndistricts_info_complete = districts_info.dropna()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-01T12:03:44.019318Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-01T12:03:44.019632Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-01T12:03:44.030115Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-01T12:03:44.0196Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-01T12:03:44.029043Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_copy = engagement_merged.copy()\nproduct_merge_available = pd.merge(df_copy, product_info[['lp_id', 'product_name']], on = 'lp_id')\n# function return number of top product based on method such as mean or median of pct_access or engagement_index and plot in word cloud to show popular product\ndef top_product_available(interest, method_wanted, amount): \n    top_product = product_merge_available.groupby(['product_name'])[str(interest)].agg(method_wanted).sort_values(ascending=False).head(amount).reset_index()\n\n    primary_func = []\n    for name in list(top_product['product_name'].values):\n        d = product_info[product_info['product_name']==name]['primary_essential_function'].values[0]\n        d = d.split('- ',1)[-1]\n        primary_func.append(d) \n\n    from wordcloud import WordCloud\n    fig = plt.figure(figsize=(15,10))\n    fig.add_subplot(121)\n    wordcloud = WordCloud (\n                        background_color = 'black',\n                        width = 812,\n                        height = 684\n                            ).generate(' '.join(list(top_product['product_name'].values)))\n    plt.imshow(wordcloud) # image show\n    plt.axis('off') # to off the axis of x and y\n\n    fig.add_subplot(122)\n    wordcloud = WordCloud (\n                        background_color = 'black',\n                        width = 812,\n                        height = 684\n                            ).generate(' '.join(primary_func))\n    plt.imshow(wordcloud) # image show\n    plt.axis('off') # to off the axis of x and y\n    return list(top_product['product_name'].values), plt.show()\n","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-01T12:03:44.0314Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-01T12:03:44.031734Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-01T12:03:52.733362Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-01T12:03:44.0317Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-01T12:03:52.732534Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"list_product = top_product_available('pct_access', np.mean, 10) # plot popular product and assign list top 10 products used by mostly student \n","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-01T12:03:52.7347Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-01T12:03:52.735046Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-01T12:03:54.651527Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-01T12:03:52.735008Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-01T12:03:54.650725Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The left chart shows top 10 products have a high average of percent access by students.

All charts above are similar in shape, in 2020 first-half year (from January to May) and last-half year (from September to December), percentage of access as well as engagement index fluctuate wildly, which means we subtract the highest percentage of access by the lowest percentage of access the value calculated is much greater than that in the period from May to Agust. Moreover, the same thing also occurs in the engagement index line chart. So what happened? One reasonable hypothesis based on school terms is as the school year in the US usually runs from early September until May or June (nine months) and is divided into ‘quarters’ or terms (semesters). Most schools use a semester system of two sessions: fall (September to December) and spring (January to May). Some schools use the quarter system, which comprises three sessions: fall (September to December), winter (January to March), and spring (March to May or June). We can infer that students take summer break (May to August), so at this time, both percent access and engagement with educational products decreased substantially. Then after traditional summer vacation, the American school year traditionally begins at the end of August or early in September, while more and more daily coronavirus cases are recorded as well as the number of deaths daily in the following months (see in the below chart), learning face-to-face was impossible so learning from home was a solution.\nConsequently, the percentage of the access and engagement index increased again. Notice that what we rely on may not an entirely correct due to confounding factors, but it is still good enough to explain where these differences come from and answer what happened. It is a good place for us to expand more hypotheses about that.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%HTML\n<div class='tableauPlaceholder' id='viz1629188702726' style='position: relative'><noscript><a href='https:&#47;&#47;covidtracking.com&#47;'><img alt='0_All Key Metrics ' src='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;CT&#47;CTPWebsiteGallery&#47;0_AllKeyMetrics&#47;1_rss.png' style='border: none' /></a></noscript><object class='tableauViz'  style='display:none;'><param name='host_url' value='https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.tableau.com%2F' /> <param name='embed_code_version' value='3' /> <param name='site_root' value='' /><param name='name' value='CTPWebsiteGallery&#47;0_AllKeyMetrics' /><param name='tabs' value='no' /><param name='toolbar' value='yes' /><param name='static_image' value='https:&#47;&#47;public.tableau.com&#47;static&#47;images&#47;CT&#47;CTPWebsiteGallery&#47;0_AllKeyMetrics&#47;1.png' /> <param name='animate_transition' value='yes' /><param name='display_static_image' value='yes' /><param name='display_spinner' value='yes' /><param name='display_overlay' value='yes' /><param name='display_count' value='yes' /><param name='language' value='en' /><param name='filter' value='publish=yes' /><param name='origin' value='viz_share_link' /></object></div>                <script type='text/javascript'>                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1629188702726');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='1000px';vizElement.style.height='627px';                    var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                </script>","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-01T12:04:01.549168Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-01T12:04:01.549509Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-01T12:04:01.556536Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-01T12:04:01.549472Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-01T12:04:01.555554Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"engagement_merged['page_load_per_student'] = engagement_merged['engagement_index'] / 1000 # add columns page load per student\nresult = pd.merge(engagement_merged, districts_info[['district_id','state','locale','pct_black/hispanic','pct_free/reduced','county_connections_ratio','pp_total_raw']]\n                 , on=\"district_id\")","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-01T12:05:06.03817Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-01T12:05:06.038543Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-01T12:05:09.458967Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-01T12:05:06.038506Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-01T12:05:09.45802Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# function display table summarize pct_acces or engagement_index per state or locale\ndef display_table_summarize(interest, state_or_locale):\n    summarize = result.groupby(str(state_or_locale))[str(interest)].describe()\n    # assign cmap\n    cm = sns.light_palette(\"green\", as_cmap=True)\n    # display summarize pct_acces per state\n    if (str(interest) == 'pct_access') & (str(state_or_locale) == 'state'):\n        sm = summarize.style.set_table_attributes(\"style='display:inline'\").set_caption('Summarize Pct_Access Per State').background_gradient(cmap=cm)\n    # display summarize engagement_index per state\n    elif (str(interest) == 'engagement_index') & (str(state_or_locale) == 'state'):\n        sm = summarize.style.set_table_attributes(\"style='display:inline'\").set_caption('Summarize Engagement_Index Per State').background_gradient(cmap=cm)\n    # display summarize pct_acces per state\n    elif (str(interest) == 'pct_access') & (str(state_or_locale) == 'locale'):\n        sm = summarize.style.set_table_attributes(\"style='display:inline'\").set_caption('Summarize Pct_Access Per Locale').background_gradient(cmap=cm)\n    # display summarize engagement_index per state\n    elif (str(interest) == 'engagement_index') & (str(state_or_locale) == 'locale'):\n        sm = summarize.style.set_table_attributes(\"style='display:inline'\").set_caption('Summarize Engagement_Index Per Locale').background_gradient(cmap=cm)\n    else:\n        return 'Interest variable is not available!!

Google Docs includes an online word processor, spreadsheet, and presentation editor if you do not know. Students and teachers can use these tools to collaborate on assignments, projects, newsletters, and blogs, among other things. In this way, Google Docs can promote teamwork and are so prevalent in school districts. A Cloud-Based Software Engineering Learning Environment report, the frequency, and percentage of the students who used Google Docs up to 71%.\\\nSince April, Google Docs was replaced by Google Classroom. Before explaining that, come back to the context in January and Feburary (2020). According to The Washington Post, U.S. intelligence agencies were issuing ominous, classified warnings in January and February about the global danger posed by the coronavirus while President Trump and lawmakers played down the threat and failed to take action that might have slowed the spread of the pathogen, according to U.S. officials familiar with spy agency reporting. At that time, Americans seemed not to care and understand what is coming to them. Before school closed, Google Docs is a tool used daily for its function provided, not mean it is a critical tool for online learning. Until school closed in March due to the outbreak of pandemic and afterward, learning became a distance learning result in Google Classroom - the most suitable tool than just Google Docs. Google Classroom allows educators can use the platform to create a virtual classroom, invite students to attend live instruction, and record students' grades. The primary purpose of Google Classroom is to simplify and streamline sharing files between students and teachers, which is why Google Classroom replaced Google Docs to become the most accessed product. As I know, U.S. students do have not to join classes during summer break, but this is not true for all students. Some students register in summer classes so that in June, roughly half is Youtube for entertainment, and the rest is Google Classroom for virtual learning.\\\nAbout the engagement index, Google Docs is still the majority because of the properties of the product. As described, the engagement index is the total page-load events per one thousand students of a given product and on a given day. It is challenging to understand what it means. There are many different ways to understand. Supposed that it means frequency we deal with, such as creating a new page, editing, loading a new page, or anything else. In this case, imagine that when you use Google Classroom, you need to join a virtual class, listen to your professor and write down a notebook; you cannot make so many page-load compared to when you use Google Docs, right? Alternatively, If page load events mean the frequency of particular loading products, do not worry about it too much. The engagement index in these cases is just an additional reference, considering page-load-per-student derived from engagement index later.\\\nOn the other hand, not only products such as Google Classroom or Google Docs, but various products appeared at the third and fourth accessed product over month shown in the chart below for your exploration. \n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# 3st Max\nplot_product_month('pct_access',3,4)\n# 4st Max\nplot_product_month('pct_access',4,4)","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-28T10:07:32.412226Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-28T10:07:32.412955Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-28T10:07:37.788615Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-28T10:07:32.41291Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-28T10:07:37.787835Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Look more detailed; most states have a page load per student greater than average are on the east coast of the U.S. The same occurred in the percentage of access.

It means school districts with a high percentage of black/Hispanic students are also high in percentage of free/reduced lunch. \n- About the expenditure, some school districts have lower than 20% black/Hispanic have both highest and lowest expenditure.

Digital Divide In Distance Learning\n\n**What is the digital divide?**\n\nThe digital divide is a term that refers to the gap between demographics and regions that have access to modern information and communications technology (ICT) and those that do not or have restricted access. This technology can include the telephone, television, personal computers, and internet connectivity. Historically known as the homework gap, which is similar to the digital divide, refers to students without high-speed internet and an e-learning device who could not complete assignments that required digital access.\n\n**Why do we consider digital divide urgent matter?**\n\nAccording to studies and reports, the digital divide is still very much a reality today. According to a 2019 report, approximately 5 million rural American households and 15.3 million urban or metro areas still do not access broadband internet. When the pandemic hit the USA in March 2020, the June 2020 report published by Common Sense and BCG found that 15 million to 16 million American K–12 students (about 30%) lacked adequate connectivity, an e-learning device, or both.\\\nMeanwhile, a study by the Pew Research Center noted that 24% of adults with household incomes below $30,000 a year do not own a smartphone, and 40% of those with lower incomes do not have home broadband services or a computer. This means that in their households, their children also cannot access digital learning.\\\nDigital learning threatened wholesale learning loss. Even as students return to the classroom and vaccines begin to be distributed, bridging the digital divide remains essential to reduce inequities, accelerate economic growth, and advance society as a whole. This brings more benefit because no one insists on what will happen, whether a similar pandemic appears or economic crisis, anything else. If you do not know, the digital divide negatively affects all aspects of your life, not only education. A candid look at the impacts of the digital divide will guide the direction and speed of bridging the digital gap. Some of the vivid effects of the digital divide are below:\n* <span style=\"color:orange\">*Impact of the digital divide on the education.*</span>\\\nIndeed, education is a very dynamic sector, and keeping up to date is crucial to success. The presence of internet access will ensure you get the latest trends and revolutionize your research skills. Today, most students do homework and hand it out to their teacher through the internet, self-learning through online courses, reading ebooks, and many other activities. And not only students but teachers also need the internet for their lectures, instructions, and management.\n* <span style=\"color:orange\">*Impact of digital divide on the economy*</span>\\\nInterestingly, socio-economic status is one of the major causes of the digital divide, and it is also a consequence of the digital divide. Penetration of the internet enables people to engage in economically productive activities such as trade without much hassle. Inversely, without the internet become a main invisible barrier to trade efficiently, returns get lowered, and so many things.\n* <span style=\"color:orange\">*Impact of digital divide on the social*</span>\\\nInternet access offers person access to a broader range of opportunities, thus creating a social divide between rich and deficient—the root of inequities, discrimination in society, especially in a multi-culture country - the USA.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ft_2021.06.22_digitaldivideincome_01.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></div>\n\n**What do we get from closing the digital divide?**\n\n<span style=\"color:orange\">Permanently closing the digital divide is a fundamental matter of equity.</span>\\\nAccording to [Broadband Gap Quello MCU](https://quello.msu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Broadband_Gap_Quello_Report_MSU.pdf) states that the absence of fast Internet access at home has a significant negative relationship to overall GPA and grades in English/language arts and social studies, but not in math and science. On average, students with fast home Internet access report an overall grade point average (GPA) of 3.18. This is significantly higher than the average 2.81 GPA for students with no access and the 2.75 average for students who have only cell phone Internet access. Moreover, the gap in digital skills, educational activities are also different. In disconnected students, the digital divide could significantly lead to learning loss and increase the dropout rate.\n\n<span style=\"color:orange\">Closing the digital divide is a future-proof, and resilient to learning.</span>\\\nIn the near term, closing the digital divide builds resilience in our learning systems, even if vaccines do not contribute to the total population and pandemics continue. It is minimizing the loss of learning and inequities of scores, accessing materials, lectures, Etc. In the long term, it decreases the dropout rate and promotes students to unlock individualized learning pathways through gamification, adaptive learning, and asynchronous engagement. Education will be better, and equity come to all, not to someone.\n\n<span style=\"color:orange\">Closing the digital divide contributes to breaking the cycle of poverty.</span>\\\nWhen the gap in digital narrowed, families have more chances to access the internet, gain necessary skills for their current jobs, meaning that they could earn more money before, and their children also have good conditions for learning and growth. Then lead to receiving better in health care, service and their life will be happier.\n\n<span style=\"color:orange\">Closing the digital divide also contributes to minimzing a lot of money spent in long term.</span>\\\nIn Maryland, to address the digital divide, $100 million is allocated to local school systems to ensure students access the most up-to-date devices and connectivity.\\\nAlabama's governor allocated 100 million in CARES Act funding for a public-private partnership to increase access to the internet for K-12 students attending school in the fall who may need internet service for distance learning.\\\nIn New Hampshire, 50 million dollars were allocated to the Connecting New Hampshire Emergency Broadband Expansion Program.\\\nThese are examples of money spent on the internet, broadband, Etc., every year. So it is urgent for comprehensive investment in closing the digital divide to take place nationwide.\n \n\nSo policymakers, government organizations, and technology companies must change the view of the digital divide because numbers do not lie. *Closing the digital divide is long-term scope. It is indeed much necessary and urgent today!*\n\n**What are the root cause of the digital divide?**\n\n\nThree key reasons explain the divide: lack of affordability, lack of availability, and lack of adoption. In plain English, the reasons come from infrastructure affordability, access challenges, and other barriers to adoption.\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E9zLXYWUYAc0huo?format=jpg&name=medium\" width=\"380\" height=\"380\" /></div>\n\n<span style=\" color: orange\">Lack of affordability:</span> Students and families who can not afford to pay for reliable internet services, e-learning devices, so it is a significant driver of households without internet or devices. See the chart below, a quarter of home broadband users with annual household incomes ranging from \\\\$30,000 to just under \\\\$50,000 say they have had trouble doing so in the pandemic, as have roughly one-in-ten (8%) with household incomes ranging from \\\\$50,000 to \\\\$74,999 according to Pew Research Center. There are also differences in Americans' educational attainment. To understand the barriers to universal internet access, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) asked families their main reason for not having access to the internet. In 2019, the two most commonly cited main reasons were that they did not have home internet access. 60% did not need it or was not interested in having it, 18.7% response that it was too expensive. Other main reasons included having no or inadequate computer (3%), internet service was not available in the area (3.2%), 3% said they used the internet somewhere else, and 2% due to privacy or security concerns. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OCED) data, the average cost of broadband internet connection in the US is \\\\$61. The US ranks second on the list of OCED countries, compared to other wealthy countries such as Germany, Japan, Finland, Denmark,...this cost is more than double. In low-income households, it is indeed an additional burden to them.\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/ft_2021.06.03_broadband_01a.png\" width=\"380\" height=\"380\" /></div>\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"nita_gov_data = pd.read_csv(r'/kaggle/input/ntiagov-dataset/ntia_analyze_2020.csv') #data set get on https://www.ntia.gov/files/ntia/publications/ntia-analyze-table_2020-05-15.csv","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-28T10:10:25.455201Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-28T10:10:25.455774Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-28T10:10:25.526864Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-28T10:10:25.455737Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-28T10:10:25.526169Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"list = ['canUseElsewhereMainReason','noNeedInterestMainReason','noComputerMainReason','unavailableMainReason','privSecMainReason','tooExpensiveMainReason']\nnot_internet_reason = nita_gov_data[nita_gov_data['variable'].isin(list)][['dataset','usProp','description']] # extract data realated to main reason not internet\nnot_internet_reason['usProp'] = not_internet_reason['usProp']*100 #convert to percentage\nnot_internet_reason['description'] = not_internet_reason['description'].apply(lambda x:x.replace(\"Main Reason for Household Not Online at Home: \",\"\")) # convert string for readable","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-28T10:10:25.528033Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-28T10:10:25.528376Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-28T10:10:25.537221Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-28T10:10:25.528341Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-28T10:10:25.536338Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import plotly.express as px\nfig = px.line(not_internet_reason, x='dataset', y='usProp', color='description')\nfig.update_layout(\n    title=\"Main Reason For Not Having Access\",\n    xaxis_title=\"Time\",\n    yaxis_title=\"Percent\",\n    legend_title=\"Main Reason\",\n    font=dict(\n        family=\"Courier New, monospace\",\n        size=15,\n        color=\"Black\"\n    )\n)\nfig.show()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-28T10:10:25.538759Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-28T10:10:25.539177Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-28T10:10:25.630932Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-28T10:10:25.539143Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-28T10:10:25.630227Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<span style=\"color:orange\">Lack of availability:</span> There is insufficient coverage to deliver wired or wireless broadband service, or where there is poor service quality (e.g., speed and reliability) in which students live. Especially in rural areas, many students and households lack internet connections because their communities lack local broadband infrastructure. This physical infrastructure problem results in specific communities not having the ability to access broadband at industry-standard speeds regardless of their desire or financial resources. According to tech-giant [Microsoft](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/technology/digital-divide-us-fcc-microsoft.html), more than 157 million people were not using the internet at broadband speeds as of 2019, while nearly 97% population said they use the internet. View the [US Investment Gaps By 2040](https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/state-us-infrastructure), experts warn of the “broadband gap,” in which rural and low-income communities suffer from a lack of infrastructure to deliver reliable, fast internet, referred to as broadband. A 2020 Federal Communications Commission report finds that some 18 million Americans, most of whom live in rural areas, lack access to any broadband network. Other estimates suggest that more than twice as many people lack access. Governors from both major parties identify internet access as a priority in their states and propose plans costing tens of millions of dollars. This issue disproportionately affects remote learning for students in rural communities where access to fixed broadband is limited. Moreover, according to the [Federal Communications \nCommission’s 2019 Broadband Deployment\nReport](https://www.fcc.gov/reports-research/reports/broadband-progress-reports/2019-broadband-deployment-report), 21.3 million Americans lack access to a connection that enables a download rate of at least 25 megabits per second and an upload rate of 3 Mbps; speeds that are considered to be the industry standard. This includes students of all levels, including both K-12 students and higher education students. \n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://broadbandnow.com/app/uploads/2020/03/access-to-terrestrial-broadband2.png\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\" /></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://broadbandnow.com/app/uploads/2020/03/fastest-speed.png\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\" /></div>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<span style=\"color:orange\">Lack of adoption:</span>: Many students and households are unable to access the internet because they do not have an adequate device to connect to the internet. According to 2018 [American Community Survey](https://futureready.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HomeworkGap_FINAL8.06.2020.pdf) data, approximately 3.6 million households, including 7.3 million children in the United States, do not have a laptop, desktop, or tablet with which to connect to the internet. The lack of a laptop or desktop computer to complete schoolwork is a barrier to full participation in remote learning. Among children ages 3-18, 17% live in households without a laptop or desktop computer. At least 11 million students do not have a computer for online learning at all, in addition to those that may need to share a single device with siblings. This is not including surveys about devices quality for distance learning. In other cases,  despite living in a place where access is available and affordable, students may be disconnected due to a wide range of adoption barriers such as insufficient digital skills, language barriers, discomfort with providing personal data, family mobility, or lack of interest. \n\n**Digitally Divide Student Segment**\n\nThe difference in the opportunity to access the internet or devices results in student segment digitally divided into three main groups: entire connected/devices or both, complete disconnected/unavailable devices or both, connect insufficient/device inefficiently or both.\n\n<span style=\"color:orange\">Full connected or available devices or both:</span> Defined as students with either distance learning devices or adequate connectivity, or both. According to the table from [U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2020/demo/hhp/hhp5.html) below, in 6,3 million students less than high school, nearly 53% has available devices or adequate connectivity for distance learning, the figures are 65% of 17 million students in high school or GED. \n\n<span style=\"color:orange\">Full disconnected or unavailable devices or both:</span> Defined as students with neither distance learning devices or adequate connectivity, or even both. The segment of least connected students is the smallest but also one of the important segments to address, including students who have no high-speed internet and no device in their household. This results in students losing their learning permanently, even increasing the dropout rate. Nearly 4.2% of 6.3 million students in less than high school (200-300 thousand students) and 2% of 17 million students in high school or GED (300-400 thousand students)\n\n<span style=\"color:orange\">Devices deficient or Connect inefficient or both:</span> Students with either devices or connectivity but usually, sometimes, or rarely available to use categorized inefficient,  or even both of them coincide. Not having appropriate devices such as laptops, computers, Etc for distance learning or not using borrowed devices cause learning inefficient & disrupt their progress. Also, unreliable internet such as low speed, not available in-home causes similar things. In less than high school students, 2-3 million students said they were in devices deficient, while that is 5-6 million students in high school or GED.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"segment = pd.read_csv(r'/kaggle/input/student-segment/student_segment.csv').dropna() # dataset source: U.S. Census Bureau Household Pulse Survey, Week 5.\nlist_segment_columns = segment.columns.values.tolist()[1:]\nfor col in list_segment_columns:\n    segment[col] = segment[col].apply(lambda x: x.replace(\",\",\"\")).astype('int64')  # reformat and convert to int\n\n# usually & rarely & sometime --> insuficient, never & always --> full\nsegment[\"avail_device\"] = segment['Device always available for educational purposes'] \nsegment['full_connect'] = segment['Internet always available for educational purposes']  \nsegment[\"unavail_device\"] = segment['Device never available for educational purposes'] \nsegment['full_disconnect'] = segment['Internet never available for educational purposes'] \nsegment[\"device_deficient\"] = segment['Device sometimes available for educational purposes'] + segment['Device usually available for educational purposes'] + segment['Device rarely available for educational purposes']\nsegment['connect_deficient'] = segment['Internet sometimes available for educational purposes'] + segment['Internet usually available for educational purposes'] + segment['Internet rarely available for educational purposes']\nsegment.drop(columns=segment.columns.values.tolist()[2:12],inplace =True)\n# display\nsegment","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-28T10:10:25.631999Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-28T10:10:25.632339Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-28T10:10:25.854769Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-28T10:10:25.632291Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-28T10:10:25.853Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Other Problems Should Be Taken Into Consideration**\n\n<span style=\"color:orange\">Teacher gap in digital:</span>  A new survey of teachers during the pandemic carried out by VeraQuest Research, LLC shows significant disparities in how confident teachers felt about using these resources. Only 66% of teachers reported being very or extremely confident in using digital media services for teaching after the pandemic-prompted shift to remote learning. This lack of confidence may in part be associated with the finding that nearly one in seven teachers (13%) had not previously used these services, reporting they started using K-12 digital media services only after the COVID-19-related school closures. In general, the more digital services a teacher was using, the higher their confidence level in using K-12 digital media in their teaching.\n\n<span style=\"color:orange\">Trend impacting the distance learning in 2020 :</span> In addition to figures collected and showed above, to get more knowledge of other perspectives around the digital divide, we explore vital underlying trends that occurred across the U.S. in 2020. Based on some analysis reports or mass media, there are five key trends considered.\n- First, unprecedented unemployment rates are forcing many families that were previously in the middle class (i.e., not\nqualified for free and reduced lunch) to require services and support to meet basic needs, including food security. Based on a [U.S. Census Bureau survey conducted from July 2 to July 7, 2020](https://www.census.gov/data-tools/demo/hhp/#/?measures=HIR), nearly 43.4 million Americans – or 25.3% of the adult population – either missed last month’s rent or mortgage payment or have little to no confidence that they can pay next month’s rent or mortgage on time. When the Keep Americans Connected Pledge expires on June 30, many families will need to make difficult financial trade-offs, including becoming delinquent on or opting out of household internet service due to these economic challenges.\n- Second, social distancing, self home quarantine under COVID-19 make internet connectivity essential to safely stay in touch with friends and family, work from home, apply for jobs, and keep up with critical developments. Before the pandemic, schools were the bridge between students with and without internet at home. Students who had previously relied on public libraries, schools, and public Wi-Fi in cafés and restaurants that are now closed or limiting patrons find that having access to the internet at home has become increasingly critical.\n- Third, 37 million total cases, 680 thousand total death, the U.S. ranked first in Covid map worldwide. Many families and students feared being diagnosed with Covid-19 and lost their families; even someone faces depression extremely.\n- Fourth, according to new data collected [Legal Templates, a company that provides legal documents](https://legaltemplates.net/resources/personal-family/divorce-rates-covid-19/#divorces-increase-in-couples-with-children), the number of people looking for divorces was 34% higher from March through June compared to 2019, 31% of the couples admitted lockdown had caused irreparable damage to their relationships. The combination of stress, unemployment, financial strain, death of loved ones, illness, homeschooling children, mental illnesses, and more has significantly strained relationships.\n- Fifth, there have been significant, swift efforts by districts, governments, the private sector, and philanthropy across the\nThe United States to provide devices and connectivity to students since March 2020. These efforts have certainly reduced the existing digital gaps among students.\n- Sixth, Covid-19 prompted the government to send Americans unprecedented financial help. President Joe Biden signed \\\\$1.9 trillion relief bill which plans to send direct payments of up to \\\\$1,400 to most Americans, extends a \\\\$300 per week unemployment insurance supplement, expands the child tax credit, and puts funds into vaccine distribution.\n\nThese supply and demand trends will undoubtedly have different and opposing impacts on the size of the digital divide in 2020, and it is too early to understand how they will change the size and nature of the divide because there is a lack of data for explaining quantitatively. However, they are critical and helpful to observe and understand the drivers and size of this gap for what happened around us in real life.

Even in states with small divides such as New Jersey, Connecticut, Massachusetts, as many as 1 in 4 students still lack adequate internet. In the U.S.’s most populous states: Texas, California, and Florida, there seem to be quite many students without reliable internet and proper devices. Even higher in rural southern states, including Mississippi, Alabama, Arkansas, and Oklahoma.\n\n<span style=\"color:orange\">Density</span>\\\nThe divide occurs in urban, suburban, and rural.  According to a Pew Research Center survey conducted earlier this year.  24% of rural adults say access to high-speed internet is a major problem in their local community, compared with 13% of urban adults and 9% of rural adults. Similar rates of concern about access to high-speed internet were shared by rural adults in both lower- and higher-income households, as well as by those with various levels of educational attainment. When looking at differences by community type in technology ownership, rural adults are less likely than urban adults to own traditional or tablet computers.\n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/FT_21.06.04_RuralBroadband.png\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\" /></div>\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/1/2018/09/FT_18.09.07_RuralInternet_roughly-one-in-four.png\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\" /></div>\n\n<span style=\"color:orange\">Race/Ethnic</span>\\\nFor both internet and computers, White and Asian children have a higher than average rate of internet access, whereas Black, Hispanic have nearly average rate and American Indian and Native Alaskan children have lower than that.

Asian alone (not Hispanic) is the lowest rate without internet or computer or both. \n\n<div style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"https://staticweb.usafacts.org/media/images/Tech_access_by_race_uVEEMGh.width-1200.png\" width=\"450\" height=\"450\" /></div>\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"by_race = pd.read_csv(r'/kaggle/input/by-race/by_race.csv') # read file csv\n# clean, reformat and pre-procssing\nby_race['Hispanic origin and Race ']=by_race['Hispanic origin and Race '].apply(lambda x : x.strip(\" \"))\nby_race['avail_device/internet/both'] = (by_race['Device always available for educational purposes']+by_race['Internet always available for educational purposes'])/2\nby_race['ineffiecient_device/internet/both'] = (by_race['Device usually available for educational purposes']+by_race['Device sometimes available for educational purposes']+by_race['Device rarely available for educational purposes']\n+by_race['Internet usually available for educational purposes']+by_race['Internet sometimes available for educational purposes']+by_race['Internet rarely available for educational purposes'])/6\nby_race['unavail_device/internet/both'] = (by_race['Device never available for educational purposes']+by_race['Internet never available for educational purposes'])/2\nby_race.drop(columns=by_race.columns.values.tolist()[2:14],inplace=True)\n\n\n#plot bar chart\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\nfig = go.Figure()\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Bar(\n    y=by_race['Hispanic origin and Race '],\n    x=by_race['avail_device/internet/both'],\n    name='Available Device/Internet or Both',\n    orientation='h',\n    marker=dict(\n        color='rgba(246, 78, 139, 0.6)',\n        line=dict(color='rgba(246, 78, 139, 1.0)', width=1))))\n\nfig.add_trace(go.Bar(\n    y=by_race['Hispanic origin and Race '],\n    x=by_race['ineffiecient_device/internet/both'],\n    name='Inefficient Device/Internet or Both',\n    orientation='h',\n    marker=dict(\n        color='rgba(18, 36, 97, 0.6)',\n        line=dict(color='rgba(18, 36, 97, 1.0)', width=1))))\nfig.add_trace(go.Bar(\n    y=by_race['Hispanic origin and Race '],\n    x=by_race['unavail_device/internet/both'],\n    name='Unavailable Device/Internet or Both',\n    orientation='h',\n    marker=dict(\n        color='rgba(58, 71, 80, 0.6)',\n        line=dict(color='rgba(58, 71, 80, 1.0)', width=1))))\n\nfig.update_layout(barmode='stack',yaxis_title=\"Race\", title=\"Digital Divide By Race/Ethnic In Week 5, 2020\")\nfig.show()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-28T10:10:25.861497Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-28T10:10:25.862036Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 4. Technology Requirements For Distance Learning (Reference)\n\nFour things should be considered for a robust distance learning experience:\n* High-speed internet (reliable)\n* Proper devices for distance learning\n* Distance learning lecture content\n* Support \n\n<span style=\"color:orange\">High-speed internet</span>\\\nInternet service availability and quality of service can be a challenge; learners must be cautious when selecting an Internet service provider. Many Internet services are promoting their services as being “high speed” when they are no faster than a low-end DSL connection. Online learners should have at least a 1.5 Mbps Internet speed as a minimum requirement (both upload and download speed), or visit [here](https://www.sde.idaho.gov/re-opening/files/connectivity/Internet-Needs-to-support-remote-learning.pdf) for more details. To determine your Internet speed, you can use various Internet speed tests such as [Speedtest](http://www.speedtest.net).\n\nPros & cons in each type of internet:\n- Fiber internet is the fastest on the market but has limited availability and is often the most expensive.\n- Cable internet is fast and widely available, making it a great option for most customers, but it may be limited in rural areas.\n- DSL internet operates through telephone networks, making it accessible to rural customers, but provides slower maximum speeds than cable.\n- Satellite internet also connects to remote locations but suffers from spotty service and notoriously slow speeds.\n\n|      Type      |  Fiber internet | Cable internet | DSL internet    | Satellite internet | Mobile Internet |\n| -------------  |:---------------:| --------------:| ---------------:| ------------------:| ---------------:|\n| Pros           | Fast, reliable  | Widely available, good speed & cost | Widely available, reasonable cost | Accessible | Convenience, flexible |\n| Cons           | Expensive, not widely available |Lower accessibility in rural and remote areas| Medium speed, vulnerable | Slower speed, expensive | Data limited, expensive |\n\n<span style=\"color:orange\">Proper devices for distance learning</span>\\\nIn order to join in distance learning, students and teachers need suitable devices, including laptops and tablets. Although mobile phones are helpful learning supplements, they are not appropriate for completing, submitting assignments, and study through virtual class a long time; many education platforms are also not optimized for mobile devices.\\\nThe appropriate device will depend on the connectivity solution available. With fixed broadband, suitable devices will include traditional laptops and tablets with built-in Wi-Fi, with no additional hardware requirements. A cellular network (4G or 5G) is the option, students and teachers will need LTE-enabled laptops or tablets or a traditional laptop or tablet plus a mobile hotspot device. Additionally, learners are encouraged to have a PC, laptops or tablets, and notebooks no more than a few years old to ensure compatibility and optimal performance (e.g., PC should have CPU Intel i3 or above, 6GB ram or above, and 500GB memory...)\n\n<span style=\"color:orange\">Instructional content for distance learning</span>\\\nMany platforms rely on real-time applications like Zoom, Meet to engage directly with students as a substitute for the in-classroom experience. They are important tools for teachers to provide engagement with classmates, as well as\n1-to-1 attention and support. Interesting & creative content are encouraged to prevent boring from students. Teachers must consider alternative instructional content, tools, and assignments that lower internet speed or have not too strong hardware requirements.\n\n<span style=\"color:orange\">Technical support for distance learning</span>\\\nQuality technical support is required as users activate, build a knowledge base, and troubleshoot issues with student or teacher's connectivity, devices, and tools. Digital literacy skills are a necessary pathway to bridging the homework gap. Students need support in developing the skills to take advantage of the opportunities enabled by internet connections and devices. Short-term training courses about technology skills for distance learning should be encouraged.\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 5. How To Close Digital Divide In The U.S.\n\nTo permanently close the digital divide, solutions must address each of the root causes presented above. \n\n<span style=\"color:orange\">Avaiability</span>\\\nIn rural areas, many students and households lack internet connections because their communities lack local broadband infrastructure. This physical infrastructure problem results in certain communities not having the ability, regardless of their desire or financial resources, to access broadband at industry-standard speeds. Permanently, closing the digital divide will only succeed if every household has a robust broadband connection. Policymakers should **promote program about widening internet network which can be accessed by everyone**. In a rural area where traditional internet, such as cable internet, cannot reach, the government may negotiate with these companies to provide satellite internet service like Starlink (Elon Musk). In old internet infrastructure, policymakers should ensure that government funding is used to upgrade and deploy broadband infrastructure that meets current established needs, at least for distance learning or even higher speed for other activities from home. **Researching new breakthrough technology in internet connection** need to be promoted and focused more. Federal and state policy should **launch policies for attracting telecommunications companies investment on internet services & infrastructure**. It does not only provide resident opportunity to access the internet, but help resident has more choice as well as expand the competition among companies which motivate them to improve their services more quality and lower cost. Recently, the plan which would devote **\\$100 billion in \\\\$2.3 trillion infrastructure package to get all Americans connected has passed in The House**. It would spend \\$100 billion to “future-proof” broadband as part of an eight-year infrastructure plan, calling high-speed connections “the new electricity” that’s now a necessity for all Americans. How is it effective? Americans could hope for promised future.\nIn addition to the internet, proper devices for learning are also necessary too. \n\n<span style=\"color:orange\">Affordable</span>\\\nWhen local broadband infrastructure is available, the next problem is that students or households will not be able to access the internet at home because they cannot afford it. As presented in sections before, the cost of the internet in the U.S. is much higher than in other high-income countries, although the average internet speed is not too impressive. Clearly, most of American is paying a higher cost for internet than others, month-by-month its cost indeed is high. While the poverty rate in the U.S. surged from 9.3% in June to 11.7% in November, due to the coronavirus pandemic’s decimation of the labor market and the months-long expiration of benefits, according to a [report](https://harris.uchicago.edu/files/monthly_poverty_rates_updated_thru_november_2020_final.pdf) released Wednesday by analysts at the University of Chicago and the University of Notre Dame, creating the most considerable increase in a single year since the government began tracking poverty in 1960. So the solution to this problem can be thought of **decreasing the cost of internet**. Policymakers and government should **hold a meeting among telecommunication companies to talk about customer care and purchase preference policy**. The priority of goal is to **drive customer benefits policies toward to the most vulnerable** which may help them break out suffering poor living conditions, typically not afford to the internet.\nSimultaneously, they should commit to **funding cost-support programs** that will cover student connectivity and device costs and ensure that all federal and state broadband programs allow for **transparency in pricing and encourage bulk-purchasing efforts** by states and districts. States and school systems will also need funding to support outreach for and **raise awareness of low-cost broadband service offerings and broadband service cost-support programs**.\n\n<span style=\"color:orange\">Adoption</span>\\\nDue to the impact of Covid-19, supply chain problems and delivery delays mean a vast, remote learning experiment still has not touched many American students as learning gaps open broader by the day. Only 24% of public school teachers reported that all of their students had access to a computer or tablet to use for schoolwork, according to a nationally representative survey of 600 public school teachers conducted in early May by Educators for Excellence (E4E). In the short-term, to solve the gap during Covid-19, governors must be committed to **creating the most favorable conditions for maintaining necessary supply chain** such as supply computers, tablets for ensuring students have sufficient conditions to continue their learning. In the long-term, because manufacturing industries, especially in the technology industry, face difficulties due to shortage of chips in global, so **government funds should be invested more in that industry and considering chip manufacturing industry is a basis which other manufacturing rely on** including computers, tablet, laptops manufacturing industry. Due to a wide range of other adoption barriers, these efforts should need to **build digital literacy included in curriculum early and inclusion skills**, which may increase trust in technology solutions and understand the importance of digital. Also, designing solutions to **address distinct student needs** is urgent such as multilingual support materials, video training, support groups, or chat which make students more confident and safer in using digital devices & the internet. Districts, community-based organizations, providers,... **play an essential role in helping address parent's potential lack of trust and skepticism** of technology solutions.\n\n>In addition to what was suggested above, imposing any policies must be based on each particular case. Because the U.S. has 50  states and each state has different data about demographics, infrastructure, Etc. It is impossible to use one state's policies and apply them to some others, right? The goal of this report is not to force policymakers or government must do what is mentioned above in a detailed manner but to navigate approaches and suggest specific solutions based on the natural root causes. This report encourages and welcomes any policies or actions which are creative, suitable, and necessary toward closing the digital divide gap. ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Conclusion\n\nThe digital divide may be the term we remember so much through this report. The digital divide has become an increasingly important element of modern education and even urgent problems in the US. Additionally, digital divides disproportionately affect specific student populations: Native American, Black, Asian, White and Hispanic students; members of low-income households; and students living in rural areas are less likely to have the internet access they need to participate fully in the education. The lack of availability, adoption, and affordability are three main critical reasons for without internet or adequate devices in students, which lead to divide in student segment and widen digital or learning gap among students. Along with the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, everything will be worse than before. The necessary actions in the short term are to help students not lose their learning progress and overcome the pandemic. In the long-term, moving forward to impose breakthrough and creative policies to close the digital gap and make American's living conditions better.","metadata":{}}]}

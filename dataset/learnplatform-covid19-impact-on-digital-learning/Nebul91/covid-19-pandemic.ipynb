We will develop different analyses based on race, reduction in food allowances, online connectivity, where students live, whether the state is Democratic or Republican, time periods (holidays and vacation and school holidays), and poverty rates in each state. \nWe have found some very nourishing findings for future study: \n- The sponsors have used a sample of 0.26% of US schools (2019-2020).\n- Economic poverty, race, location and internet connectivity are the four key factors in a child's determination to advance in school without the frustration created by the social divide. \n- Arizona and North Dakota are the states with the highest pct_acces and engagement_index. \n- In the fall semester of the 2020-2021 academic year, lunch reduction demands increased dramatically (68%) from the previous year. \n- Democratic states implemented an emergency plan to address the non-transmission of Covid-19 than Republican states (Arizona is the exception as it is a pro-online state). There are countries in Spain where this technique is widely used).</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Introduction:\n<div style=\"text-align: justify\">The Covid-19 pandemic has negatively affected the lives of people on Earth. The economy, education, the welfare state, politics and the health care system have been altered and suffocated by the pandemic. \nThe first American case was reported on January 20, and President Donald Trump declared the U.S. outbreak a public health emergency on January 31. Restrictions were placed on flights arriving from China,but the initial U.S. response to the pandemic was otherwise slow, in terms of preparing the healthcare system, stopping other travel, and testing.Meanwhile, Trump remained optimistic and was accused by his critics of underestimating the severity of the virus.\nFrom that moment on, President Donald Trump instituted secular policies based on the ideology that democratic states would be the ones affected by the pandemic, because official reports announced that people of colour, indigenous and Hispanic people were the most affected by the pandemic, causing large outbreaks in Seattle and New York (NY). This campaign was fatal to the implementation of containment measures to stop the spread of the virus in the population. However, thanks to the tenth amendment to the US constitution, democratic states began to put in place health and public protection policies before the pandemic was officially declared by the OMS on 2020-03-11. In Washington, for example, schools and universities began to close on 29 February. This was followed by California and NY on 4 and 7 March respectively. This influences the population of each state differently, causing a contrast between states, and a unified chaos. The impact of Covid-19 has been analysed in healthcare, economics, politics, but what about the education of children? To stop the spread of Covid-19, one of the basic regulations was to close schools to stop contagion. Traditional (face-to-face) education was severely affected and a distance and/or online system had to be quickly put in place to minimise the impact of the education and thus be able to continue their education. The system was not ready, and in many states, a network for online education was not in place. Applications were created and, thanks to various platforms, it was possible to continue the education of children. But at this point new questions arise:\nDo all households have broadband internet, do all households have devices to connect to the internet, does living in the city and in rural areas have an influence? All these questions are the consequence of one irrefutable fact: the social-economic gap will be further accentuated because traditional state-provided education will be directly dependent on the economy of each household. This will stifle the chances of passing courses and will stress family coexistence, especially for the most disadvantaged. Another part included in this reflection will be the aid that parents request from the states for the reduction of the school lunch. In order to answer all these questions we will use three sets of datasets provided by the sponsors of the contest and additional material researched by myself creating additional datasets to complete the information.</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Preparation:\n<div style=\"text-align: justify\">To analyse the analysis of the change in the learning situation of our students, we have three main datasets: products.csv, district.csv and engagement dataset.

However, the majority of states in the selected sample have a value lower than unity. This would imply that not all households have an internet connection.

This is followed by 21.1% for `Digital Learning Platform`. This means that the products that students use are mostly for studying and for this they use digital platforms with free software or cloud technology so that, regardless of the memory and hardware they use, they can store and search for their references with the greatest convenience. It is interesting to note that only 2.08% used `Virtual Classroom`. This would indicate that only 2.08% had the option of streaming classes between teacher and student, implying that the continuity of classes simulating face-to-face mode (i.e., that every day they could give the subject as in traditional schools) followed a more complete and dynamic curriculum than the rest of the students.  This implies a lack of daily monitoring by teachers, implying an inequality in the content taught. Next, we could look at the different products that comprise the `Virtual Classroom`. The ones that stand out are `Meet` and `Zoom`. In order to visualise this graph I had to average the variable `pct_access`, which means % of students in the district have at least one page-load event of a given product and on a given day. We got a bit ahead of ourselves, as I first wanted to take a snapshot of each of the variables involved and then we would see how they evolved over time. In order to be able to visualise it better, the weekend periods have been eliminated as there are no virtual classes in streaming. However, it is interesting to see that at the beginning the average pct_acces of Meet did not reach 11%. What does this mean? 11 % of students in the district have at least one page-load event of Zoom or Meet. In the months of July, August there is practically no activity until the school year 2020-2021 autumn semester starts. It can be seen that, due to the abundant outbreaks in the different states due to international and domestic travel, it was again decreed to close the classrooms of all schools, in order to avoid contagion. The schools were more prepared to offer their curriculum online and the homes had been able to prepare a little more to obtain a device so that the student could continue their studies. That is why the pct_access increases to 18% during the autumn semester.

In Arizona, for example, in week 12-13 there is a significant drop in the variables.

","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Conclusions:\n\n<div style=\"text-align: justify\"> With all this analysis we have uncovered different points relevant for this study and future analyses.\nDifferent analyses have been done to complete the datasets in the most optimal way. We have searched for information from the links provided by the sponsors of the competition. There are different aspects to take into account. At the beginning of the pandemic, when Donald Trump was still laughing about the situation, there was a considerable increase in the number of cases all over the USA. Cities where there is an index of indigenous, black and Hispanic population were more prone to the disease than the white race. This is a purely economic factor. Non-whites have lower incomes, as their jobs are cheap labour. This means that there will be more fat and carbohydrates than quality protein in their shopping baskets. This virus affects the immune system and the immune system in turn relies on the vitamins and minerals the body has to build up its defences. That is why the virus initially affected more democratic states. This fact led the rulers of these states to apply very restrictive laws and regulations, including school closures. At this time, children could not attend classes in person and this affected their school performance. People of colour and Hispanics were again affected because classes were now held online. This meant that the internet and electronic devices were available for teaching. The lower classes were severely affected. In North America, schools provide 'free/reduced' food for children to eat. This meant that in the absence of this support, vulnerable family members were increasingly separated from the state of comfort. Thus, race, connectivity, parental income and the availability of electronic devices marked a large social divide that led to frustration and suffocation for many families. Different states, seeing this situation, proposed an 'easier' system for those children with problems in accessing school materials. This made the situation a little easier but it is still too early to see to what extent this little push is effective for the education of our students.

That is, an average of 44.35% ask for a reduction of [0.75,1[. This means that there is a clear economic gap between the races of the students and their annual income. \nOf the 4 localities, City has the highest poverty with 41.4% asking for a reduction of [0.75,1[. If we look at the reasons for this result, it falls on non-white students.

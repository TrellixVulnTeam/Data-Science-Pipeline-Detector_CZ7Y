In the Spring of 2020, most states and local governments across the U.S. closed educational institutions to stop the spread of the virus. In response, schools and teachers have attempted to reach students remotely through distance learning tools and digital platforms. Until today, concerns of the exacaberting digital divide and long-term learning loss among Americaâ€™s most vulnerable learners continue to grow.\n\n## Challenge\nExplore (1) the state of digital learning in 2020 and (2) how the engagement of digital learning relates to factors such as district demographics, broadband access, and state/national level policies and events.\n\n## Questions\n1. What is the picture of digital connectivity and engagement in 2020?\n2. What is the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on online and distance learning, and how might this also evolve in the future?\n3. How does student engagement with different types of education technology change over the course of the pandemic?\n4. How does student engagement with online learning platforms relate to different geography? Demographic context (e.g., race/ethnicity, ESL, learning disability)? Learning context? Socioeconomic status?\n5.

Moreover, just as digital learning was beginning to gain traction, the pandemic halted all progress measured by engagement. The higher level of engagement with products associated with state and district operations may be an indication that these products were more difficult to use or required more frequent page loads than products associated with learning and curriculum. One possibility for this discrepancy is that products with learning did not require much page loads and consisted mainly of students staring at the screen instead of interacting with the product.\n\nBased on the above findings, the general sense is that engagement is low - many students spend more time on administrative tasks (measured by SDO products) than learning (measured by LC products). Even before the pandemic, this struggle was obvious and although access and engagement began to increase it quickly reversed itself when the the pandemic began and never recovered to its original levels. We can conclude that the future of online learning is not too bright.

Therefore changes in using such type of the systems is going to be indicative of the global impact of Covid-19 pandemics on both  the Pre-K12 school system and higher eduction in USA.\n\n# Pre-Requisites\n\nFirst of all, we are going to place some preparational (pre-requisite) code into our notebook.

However, it can draw a lot of insights as well as define the extension points (directions for further research).\n\nFirst of all, we can capture essential 'features' of the time series representing the changes in the engagement index through 2020 as follows\n- there is a strong weeekly seasonality (weekends to display lower engagement charts vs. the regular business days)\n- there is a strong vacation/holiday effect on the engagement charts (see the generic decline in the engagement index charts in all of the states across the country during the summer and Christmas holidays as well as per the mid-year holiday schedule in different states)\n- unique school year schedule in different states or even at the school district level contributes to the seasonal effects observed\n\nWe can also conclude on the states with the highers and lowest average engagement index level across 2020 as follows\n- UT and CT to demonstrate the highest average engagement index levels\n- FL, TN, TX, AZ, MN, and NJ to demonstrate the lowest average engagement index levels\n\nAt the same time, observing the changes in the engagement index charts across the year of 2020, we can see the interference of the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown-driven changes with seasonal and school year schedule effects. The most interesting observations are logged below\n\n-\tMin activity as of Jan 1, 2020\n-\tJan 2-3: Mid-level activity spikes in CT and MA, moderate spike in UT\n-\tJan 6: huge engagement spikes in CT and UT, mid-level engagement spikes in MA, OH, IN, and IL\n-\tJan 7: IL becomes to be in the high spike ‘zone’, like CT and UT\n-\tJan 9: MO enters the mid-spike ‘zone’, in addition to the above-mentioned states\n-\tFL, TN, TX, AZ, MN , NJ and other states to be on the low end of the engagement scale\n-\tJan 14: CA enters the mid-spike ‘zone’, in addition to other states mentioned above; FL and TX outperform ND on the lower end of the scale\n-\tJan 30: NY enters the middle-level engagement zone, in addition to other states mentioned above\n-\tEffectively the date of the start of the huge global-level panic around Covid-19 outbreak (Feb 24, 2021), we can observe more states to go to the high-engagement zone (UT, CT, MA, OH, IN, IL) as well as additional states to go to the mid-level engagement zone (NC and VA, in addition to earlier present states – CA, NY, and MO)\n-\tThe situation and trends detected as of Feb 24, 2020 take the effect through Mar 18, 2020, and then we see the new shift (NY to go to the high-engagement zone; OH, IL and MA to drop to the middle-level engagement zone; NH to become more active yet still operating on the low engagement level; significant activity drop in FL, AZ, NC, and VA)\n-\tStarting Mar 19, 2020, NY goes back to the middle-engagement zone\n-\tAs of Mar 27, only CT and UT remain in the high-engagement zone, with the rest of states in it dropping down to the middle-engagement zone\n-\tEffectively Apr 4, MA joins CT and UT in the high-engagement zone, and FL outperforms all other states in the low-engagement zone\n-\tAs of Apr 15, MA goes back to the middle-engagement zone\n-\tAs of Apr 29, IL joins CT and UT in the high-engagement zone\n-\tAs of May 6, MA joins CT, UT and IL in the high-engagement zone\n-\tAs of May 8, MA and IL drop to the middle-engagement zone again\n-\tAs of May 11, MA returns to the high-engagement zone, and NJ becomes to be the leader in the low-engagement zone\n-\tAs of May 20, only CT remains in the high-engagement zone (even UT temporary drops from it)\n-\tMay 22-31: generic slow-down across the country, no states to be in the high-engagement zone\n-\tJun 1: CT and MA return to the high-engagement zone\n-\tJun 5: CT and MA drop down to the middle-level engagement zone\n-\tJun 13: generic slow-down across the country (summer holidays driven) – all states dropped to the low-end engagement zone\n-\tMid Aug 2020: as state districts come back to the school one by one, we can see gradual increase in the engagement level again (As of Aug 14, IN to enter the mid-level engagement zone; as of Aug 18, IN to enter the high-engagement zone, with CA and IL to enter the mid-level engagement zone; as of Aug 20, UT and IL to enter the high-engagement zone, in addition to IN; as of Aug 26, OH to enter the middle-level engagement zone)\n-\tAs of Sep 2, CT returns to the mid-level engagement zone\n-\tAs of Sep 10, CT joins UT and MA in the high-level engagement zone\n-\tAs of Sep 22, IL and IN return to the high-end engagement zone to join CT, UT and MA there, and NY enters the middle-level engagement zone\n-\tAs of Oct 2, IL drops to the middle-level engagement zone\n-\tAs of Oct 7, IL re-enters the high-level engagement zone\n-\tAs of Oct 15, UT drops to the middle-level engagement zone\n-\tAs of Oct 19, UT comes back to the high-level engagement zone\n-\tThe fluctuations across the high- and middle-level engagement zones observed in Oct 2020 are manifested in Nov and Dec (more specifically, on Dec 1-19)\n-\tAfter Dec 19, we observe the generic decline in the engagement charts across all of the country in observance of the Christmas holidays season\n\nThe observations above manifest the promising extensions to the research in future\n\n- detailed Time Series  analysis of the engagement index data in the different states across the US\n- finding the impact of/correlations with the lockdown and other Covid-19-driven policy actions in different states in 2020\n- investigating the possible correlation/inference with the mobility behaviour changes and Digital Learning platform engagement index charts\n\nTherefore this notebook is by no mean is complete. It is to be continued/extended  in future.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# References\n\nKudos to https://gist.github.com/rogerallen/1583593 for putting together the complete Pythonic mapping between the US State names and abbreviations.\n\n","metadata":{}}]}

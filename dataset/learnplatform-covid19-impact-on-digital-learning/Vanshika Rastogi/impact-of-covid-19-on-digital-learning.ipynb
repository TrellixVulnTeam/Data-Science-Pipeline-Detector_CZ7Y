In the Spring of 2020, most states and local governments across the U.S. closed educational institutions to stop the spread of the virus. In response, schools and teachers have attempted to reach students remotely through distance learning tools and digital platforms. Until today, concerns of the exacaberting digital divide and long-term learning loss among Americaâ€™s most vulnerable learners continue to grow.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<img src = 'https://www.deccanherald.com/sites/dh/files/styles/article_detail/public/article_images/2017/10/25/639382.jpg?itok=3gVHgLWL'>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The COVID-19 has resulted in schools shut all across the world. Globally, over 1.2 billion children are out of the classroom. As a result, education has changed dramatically, with the distinctive rise of e-learning, whereby teaching is undertaken remotely and on digital platforms. Research suggests that online learning has been shown to increase retention of information, and take less time, meaning the changes coronavirus have caused might be here to stay.\nSome students without reliable internet access and/or technology struggle to participate in digital learning; this gap is seen across countries and between income brackets within countries. In the US, there is a significant gap between those from privileged and disadvantaged backgrounds: whilst virtually all 15-year-olds from a privileged background said they had a computer to work on, nearly 25% of those from disadvantaged backgrounds did not. While some schools and governments have been providing digital equipment to students in need, such as in New South Wales, Australia, many are still concerned that the pandemic will widen the digital divide.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # For visualisation\nimport seaborn as sns # For visualisation\nfrom warnings import filterwarnings\nfilterwarnings('ignore')\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-06T07:44:33.000186Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-06T07:44:33.000717Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-06T07:44:34.328948Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-06T07:44:33.000684Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-06T07:44:34.327885Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> # **Data Overview**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"products = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/learnplatform-covid19-impact-on-digital-learning/products_info.csv\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-06T08:15:52.723653Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-06T08:15:52.724054Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-06T08:15:52.739339Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-06T08:15:52.724024Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-06T08:15:52.7382Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"products.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-06T08:15:55.931808Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-06T08:15:55.932363Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-06T08:15:55.945756Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-06T08:15:55.93232Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-06T08:15:55.944715Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> ## **Products Data Description**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* LP ID - The unique identifier of the product\n* URL - Web Link to the specific product\n* Product Name - Name of the specific product\n* Provider/Company Name - Name of the product provider\n* Sector(s) - Sector of education where the product is used\n* Primary Essential Function - The basic function of the product.

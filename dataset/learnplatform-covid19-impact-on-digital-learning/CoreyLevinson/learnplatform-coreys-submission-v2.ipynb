They want to study how the Covid 19 pandemic has exacerbated this inequality. LP was founded to give equal access to education to all students.\n\nYour goal is to look for educational inequalities with respect to district demographics, broadband access, state Covid policies, and then propose a solution to remedy these inequalities.\n\nWhy should I even care? From the Covid 19 pandemic, education became virtual. So you are trying to identify: (1) how did people learn during the 2020 pandemic? and (2) how virtual learning inequality relates to district demographics, broadband access, and state Covid policies.\n\nThis notebook looks at the online learning inequality between advantaged (low minority/paid lunch) and disadvantaged (high minority/free lunch) schools within each state. The notebook first looks at the delta before and after K-12 public schools were closed, finding that the online learning gap on average *increased* after K-12 public schools closed. It then proposes four states in which more analysis can be done to discover if we could learn anything from their educational policies. It finally ends with a case study on Utah, because it was a state with high inequality during Covid-19, however for the 2020-21 school year, it basically had online learning equality, and we discover which products drive that change.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport os, gc\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nplt.rcParams[\"figure.figsize\"]=20,7\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport datetime\n\nimport umap\n\nsns_deep10 = ['#4C72B0','#DD8452','#55A868','#C44E52','#8172B3','#937860','#DA8BC3','#8C8C8C','#CCB974','#64B5CD']\n\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', 500)\npd.set_option('display.width', 1000)","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-30T06:16:54.02983Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-30T06:16:54.030213Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-30T06:17:01.490343Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-30T06:16:54.03018Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-30T06:17:01.489556Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Read districts_info:","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":false}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"districts_info = pd.read_csv('../input/learnplatform-covid19-impact-on-digital-learning/districts_info.csv')","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-30T06:17:01.491777Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-30T06:17:01.492248Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-30T06:17:01.514463Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-30T06:17:01.492205Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-30T06:17:01.513615Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data cleaning districts_info:","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":false}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def convert_range_to_float(the_range):\n    '''\n    Input:\n        the_range (string) - string of the form \"[x, y[\" where x and y are numbers\n    Output:\n        avg - the average values of x and y\n    '''\n    return (float(the_range[0][1:]) + float(the_range[1][:-1])) / 2","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-30T06:17:01.516504Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-30T06:17:01.516907Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-30T06:17:01.521766Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-30T06:17:01.516866Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-30T06:17:01.521151Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# The pct_black/hispanic are represented by quintile ranges\n# Let's convert them to numeric by taking the middle\nmask = districts_info['pct_black/hispanic'].notnull()\ndistricts_info.loc[mask, 'pct_black/hispanic'] = districts_info.loc[mask, 'pct_black/hispanic'].str.split(',').apply(convert_range_to_float)\ndistricts_info['pct_black/hispanic'] = districts_info['pct_black/hispanic'].astype('float64')\n\n# pct_free/reduced refers to what % of students are eligible for a free/reduced lunch\n# Therefore it's a signal for economic status;

Florida has Spring Break, then minor increase of virtual increase which decayed toward Summer. Then after Summer, 2x increase which dipped a little but was sustained.\n6. Illinois had a small bump up in virtual learning which decayed toward Summer. After summer, a small increase in virtual learning which was sustained for months.\n7. Indiana had high virtual learning before the pandemic, then it looks like virtual learning went way down during the pandemic (why?) After Summer, virtual learning was high again.\n8.

So we couldn't take the difference between the two (it was all NULL values) so nothing was plotted!\n\n1. California had slightly more online learning engagement from disadvantaged schools, but AFTER the State of emergency was issued and the K-12 public schools were closed, you can clearly see that the Advantaged schools start having more online learning engagement! After summer vacation, the disadvantaged schools have more online learning for about 1 month, and then the advantaged schools have more online learning engagement for the rest of our data period.\n2. Connecticut had more online learning engagement for advantaged schools than disadvantaged schools both before AND after the pandemic. However, similar to California, you can see that the difference between the two nearly doubled when the State of Emergency and K-12 public schools were closed.\n3. Illinois is in a similar situation. You can see that advantaged schools had more online learning, but after the state of emergency and K-12 public schools closed, the advantaged schools had nearly 3-4x more online learning engagement than the disadvantaged schools!\n4. Massachusetts had nearly perfect equality before the State of emergency. Then Advantaged schools had more online engagement than Disadvantaged schools. However, after a period of about 2 months, they came back down to roughly equality measures in May 2020.\n5. Missouri is biased toward Advantaged schools having more engagement. After the State of Emergency and K-12 schools closing, the level of inequality actually lowered.\n6. New York is the opposite from all of the other states. Before the K-12 public schools closing, Advantaged schools by far had 100,000 more pageloads per 1k students on average compared to Disadvantaged schools. Even after the State of Emergency was issued, this bias still existed. However, right when the K-12 public schools closed, we clearly see New York does a complete 180 and now the Disadvantaged schools have 100,000 more pageloads per 1k students compared to the Advanted schools. And this slowly tapered down toward equality as summer rolled along, but actually when school started again in September 2020, Disadvantaged schools are still engaging more with online learning compared to Advantaged schools.\n7. North Carolina - not enough schools to really make a confident statement\n8. Ohio had more engagement by Advanted schools. After K-12 public schools were closed, it took a drop for a few weeks but then went back to the pre-pandemic inequality levels.\n9. Utah is really different compared to the other states. Utah pre-pandemic had Disadvantaged schools engaging in more online learning than Advantaged schools. When K-12 public schools closed, this inequality strengthened, but slowly tapered back to equality during summer 2020. When school resumed back in September 2020, we can actually see this equality being roughly maintained, indicating that Utah was able to solve the inequality online learning gap for the 2020-21 school year.\n10. Virginia doesn't have enough schools to make a confident statement. (But it looks like inequality INCREASED after K-12 public schools were closed).\n11. Washington doesn't have enough schools to make a confident statement.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Can you give me some statistics of the pageloads differnece before and after K-12 public schools closed?\n\nYes, I can.

This means that Utah created some measures for the new school year that helped eliminate inequality for online learning.\n2. Massachusetts. This state had equality pre-pandemic, and once K-12 public schools were shut down, they experienced a gap in online learning between Advantaged and Disadvantaged schools. Massachusetts is probably a case-study of what NOT to do, because things were fine before the pandemic and then they changed it so that Disadvantaged schools began having fewer pageloads compared to Advantaged schools. However, the inequality only lasted for 2 months (or was it because summer came around?) So take this finding with a grain of salt.\n3. Missouri. This state took measures to reduce the gap.\n4.

What we saw was that when K-12 public schools were closed by the state, the inequality gap increased for pretty much every state, on average over 3,000 pageloads per 1k students\n4. From those insights we highlighted four interesting states: Utah (because they had an online learning gap in 2019-20, but then virtually eliminated inequality in the 2020-21 school year), Massachusetts (they had equality pre-pandemic, but post-pandemic they INCREASED the inequality gap, so we should study them as an idea for what not to do), Missouri (this is one of the few states that managed to lower its inequality gap after K-12 public schools closed), and New York (their inequality shifted from Advantaged schools getting more online learning engagement to Disadvantaged schools getting more online learning engagement. And it happened right when K-12 public schools closed. Looking into why this happened may yield important discoveries)\n5. We focused on Utah for the conclusion because the fact that they were able to reduce their inequality gap for the 2020-21 school year was very attractive to me.\n6. By looking at the products which most shrink the gap between Disadvantaged and Advantaged schools in Utah, we found a new product being used a LOT more in the 2020-21 school year: Edgenuity.\n7. Therefore, maybe to promote more equality among schools in our post-covid world, we could rely on a tool like Edgenuity to foster more online engagement. \n\nedgenuity.com/states/utah/","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}

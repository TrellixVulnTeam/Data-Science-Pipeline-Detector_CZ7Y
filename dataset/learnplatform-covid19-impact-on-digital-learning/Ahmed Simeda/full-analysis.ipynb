The COVID-19 Pandemic has disrupted learning for more than 56 million students in the United States. In the Spring of 2020, most states and local governments across the U.S. closed educational institutions to stop the spread of the virus. In response, schools and teachers have attempted to reach students remotely through distance learning tools and digital platforms. Yet not every student has equal opportunities to learn. Effective policies and plans need to be enacted in order to make education more equitable.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.2 Columns Description <a id=3></a>\n\n<h2 align='center'><font color='#290066'>Engagement data</font></h2><a id=1></a>\n\n| Column | Description |\n| -:- | -:- |\n| time | Date in \"YYYY-MM-DD\" |\n| lp_id | The unique identifier of the product |\n| pct_access | Percentage of students in the district have at least one page-load event of a given product and on a given day |\n| engagement_index | Total page-load events per one thousand students of a given product and on a given day |\n\n\n<h2 align='center'><font color='#290066'>District Information data</font></h2><a id=1></a>\n\n| Column | Description |\n| -:- | -:- |\n| district_id | The unique identifier of the school district |\n| state | The state where the district resides in |\n| locale | NCES locale classification that categorizes U.S. territory into four types of areas: City, Suburban, Town, and Rural.

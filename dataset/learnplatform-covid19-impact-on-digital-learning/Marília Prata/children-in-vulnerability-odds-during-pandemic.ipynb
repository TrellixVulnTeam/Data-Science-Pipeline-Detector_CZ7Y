How to engage children in vulnerability conditions?\n\n\"Child vulnerability is the outcome of a range of complex factors that compound over time. Millions of children from diverse backgrounds face daily hardships ranging from poor housing and inadequate diets to maltreatment and unsafe neighbourhoods. Vulnerability locks disadvantaged children into disadvantaged adulthood, putting the brakes on social mobility. Investing in vulnerable children is not only an investment in disadvantaged individuals, families and communities, it is an investment in more resilient societies and inclusive economies.\"\n\n\n\"We should analyse the environmental factors that contribute to child vulnerability. Implementing cross-cutting well-being strategies that focus on empowering vulnerable families; strengthening children’s emotional and social skills; strengthening child protection; improving children’s health and educational outcomes; and reducing child poverty and material deprivation. Such policies reduce the barriers to healthy child development and well-being and increase opportunities and resources, thereby helping vulnerable children build resilience.\"\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1787/10e8a12c-en\n\nhttps://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/social-issues-migration-health/changing-the-odds-for-vulnerable-children_10e8a12c-en","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://media.springernature.com/lw685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41390-020-1039-7/MediaObjects/41390_2020_1039_Fig1_HTML.png?as=webp)https://www.nature.com/articles/s41390-020-1039-7","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install dataprep","metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-13T23:22:32.923132Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-13T23:22:32.923487Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-13T23:22:39.512936Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-13T23:22:32.923456Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-13T23:22:39.511803Z"},"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/learnplatform-covid19-impact-on-digital-learning/districts_info.csv\", low_memory=False)\nprint(df.shape)\ndf.head().style.set_properties(**{'background-color':'purple',\n                                     'color': '#7FFFD4'})","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-13T23:22:53.610343Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-13T23:22:53.610705Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-13T23:22:53.638457Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-13T23:22:53.610657Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-13T23:22:53.637338Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df1 = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/learnplatform-covid19-impact-on-digital-learning/products_info.csv\", low_memory=False)\nprint(df1.shape)\ndf1.head().style.set_properties(**{'background-color':'#8FBC8F',\n                                     'color': 'DarkSlateGrey'})","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-13T23:23:00.055119Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-13T23:23:00.055466Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-13T23:23:00.081047Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-13T23:23:00.055434Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-13T23:23:00.080098Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df2 = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/cusersmarildownloadsattendancecsv/attendance.csv\", encoding ='ISO-8859-1',sep=\";\")\nprint(df2.shape)\ndf2.head().style.set_properties(**{'background-color':'#1E90FF',\n                                     'color': 'FireBrick'})","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-13T23:23:05.453159Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-13T23:23:05.453515Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-13T23:23:05.479625Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-13T23:23:05.453475Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-13T23:23:05.47853Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df3=pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/cusersmarildownloadsoddscsv/odds.csv',encoding ='utf8',sep=\";\")\nprint(df3.shape)\ndf3.tail().style.set_properties(**{'background-color':'#FFD700',\n                                     'color': 'Black'})","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-13T23:23:11.366655Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-13T23:23:11.367031Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-13T23:23:11.389055Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-13T23:23:11.366996Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-13T23:23:11.388126Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df4=pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/cusersmarildownloadsclosurecsv/closure.csv',encoding ='ISO-8859-1',sep=\";\")\ndf4.head().style.set_properties(**{'background-color':'#00BFFF',\n                                     'color': 'Black'})","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-13T23:23:16.381241Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-13T23:23:16.381749Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-13T23:23:16.423729Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-13T23:23:16.381704Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-13T23:23:16.422699Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Dataprep The easiest way to prepare data in Python\n\nDataPrep is free, open-source software released under the MIT license.

RACHAEL MAHMOOD - APRIL 27, 2020\n\n\"Taking time to check assumptions about family engagement can make a huge difference in the lives of your students and their caregivers.\"\n\n\"Research confirms that family involvement positively impacts students’ academic experiences. And in this moment of crisis, especially, engaging our students means engaging their families: Including caretakers is one way to support our students from a distance.\"\n\n\"More often, however, the examples caregivers used to describe their engagement did not align with what educators frequently identify as family involvement. Parents and guardians described teaching cultural lessons and supporting social emotional learning, for example. They engaged with their children’s schooling by relocating to change school districts and navigating social services to ensure their children’s needs were met.\"\n\n\"When designing engaging lessons, even the most well-intentioned teachers can make incorrect assumptions about family involvement. Not all caregivers are home with their children during this distance learning time. Many students are home alone, are being cared for by older children or are taking care of younger children. Caregivers who are at home may be adjusting to working remotely. Only a small percentage of students have a caregiver free of other responsibilities who can dedicate time to guiding them through their learning packets or navigating websites.\"\n\nhttps://www.learningforjustice.org/magazine/rethinking-family-engagement-during-school-closures","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df2.isnull().sum()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-13T23:25:25.150317Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-13T23:25:25.150653Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-13T23:25:25.158913Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-13T23:25:25.150623Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-13T23:25:25.157968Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"corr=df2[df2.columns.sort_values()].corr()\nmask

Home Learning during School Closures</b></h1></center>\n\nMagnifying inequality? Home learning environments and social reproduction during school closures in Ireland\n\nAuthors: Gretta Mohan, Eamonn Carroll, Selina McCoy, Ciarán Mac Domhnaill & Georgiana Mihut\n\nIrish Educational Studies -Volume 40, 2021 - Issue 2: COVID-19 and Education: Positioning the Pandemic; Facing the Future.\n\n\"This paper presents research on the resources and supports available for students to engage with learning in their home environments. Evidence from a nationally representative survey comprising one third of second-level school leaders, conducted during the first school closures in 2020, shows that attendance and engagement appears to be influenced by the educational level of parents/guardians.\"\n\n\"More than three quarters of school leaders reported school attendance worsened during the closures period. Reduced student engagement across the whole school was reported by 70% of schools, and 65% reported negative effects on engagement for Junior Certificate students and over half reported such among Leaving Certificate students.\"\n\n\"Where the classroom presents a (roughly) equal learning environment for all students, the HLE was characterised by the largely unique experience of every household. Families had differential access to suitable devices and broadband, and varying degrees of appropriate space shared between different numbers of children and, where they were working from home, parents as well.\"\n\n\"Parental support became even more important in the absence of normal school structures to encourage or enforce student attendance and engagement. The long-term benefits of remaining engaged became more intangible for those struggling from day to day.\"\n\nhttps://doi.org/10.1080/03323315.2021.1915841\n\nhttps://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03323315.2021.1915841","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Code by Parul Pandey  https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/a-guide-to-handling-missing-values-in-python\n\n\nfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\ndf4_most_frequent = df.copy()\n#setting strategy to 'mean' to impute by the mean\nmean_imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='most_frequent')# strategy can also be mean or median \ndf4_most_frequent.iloc[:,:] = mean_imputer.fit_transform(df4_most_frequent)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-13T23:39:05.710352Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-13T23:39:05.710898Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-13T23:39:05.724506Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-13T23:39:05.710862Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-13T23:39:05.723501Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Remove commas to avoid errors ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10\n\n#Code by Sohom Majumder https://www.kaggle.com/sohommajumder21/statistical-tests-for-understanding-life-value/comments\n\ndf4['latitude']=df4['latitude'].str.replace(',', '.')\ndf4['latitude'] = pd.to_numeric(df4['latitude'], errors = 'coerce')\n\ndf4['longitude']=df4['longitude'].str.replace(',', '.')\ndf4['longitude'] = pd.to_numeric(df4['longitude'], errors = 'coerce')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-13T23:39:19.748993Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-13T23:39:19.749496Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-13T23:39:19.757411Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-13T23:39:19.749459Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-13T23:39:19.756461Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Code by Taikutsu https://www.kaggle.com/ravels1991/simple-eda/comments\n\ng = sns.lmplot(x=\"longitude\", y=\"latitude\", data=df4,\n           fit_reg=False, scatter_kws={\"s\": 30}, hue='status', height=10)\nplt.title('School Closures by Status')\nplt.show()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-13T23:39:27.065734Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-13T23:39:27.066059Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-13T23:39:27.657822Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-13T23:39:27.06603Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-13T23:39:27.656886Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1><span class=\"label label-default\" style=\"background-color:black;border-radius:100px 100px; font-weight: bold; font-family:Garamond; font-size:20px; color:#03e8fc; padding:10px\">What they mean for students’ return to the classroom?</span></h1><br>\n\n\n\"As schools reopen for all students, the importance of these findings mainly lies in what they mean for students’ return to the classroom.\"\n\n\"Student engagement and attendance during the lockdown existed along a spectrum, and each of the factors above influenced student’s capacity and motivation to attend, but no single factor determined it completely.

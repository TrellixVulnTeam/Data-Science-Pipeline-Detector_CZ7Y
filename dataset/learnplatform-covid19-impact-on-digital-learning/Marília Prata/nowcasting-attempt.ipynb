Keith Browning coined the term in 1981 -many Kagglers aren't even born - (WMO, 2017) to describe forecasting the weather in the very near future based on its current state.\"\n\n\"The concept and term remained in the meteorological domain for years before being adopted into the economic literature in the 2000s. The concept of real-time estimates of the macroeconomic situation predates the adoption of the nowcasting terminology.\"\n\n\"The 2010s saw a wealth of papers examining the topic both for a range of target variables as well as with a range of methodologies and models. Targets most often included GDP. Common methodologies include dynamic factor models (DFM), and mixed-frequency vector autoregression (VAR).\"\n\n\"Nowcasting also has relevance in the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Many indicators face issues in terms of data quality, availability, timeliness, or all three. As such, nowcasting is being discussed as a possible method of ensuring maximum coverage in terms of indicators.\"\n\nhttps://unctad.org/system/files/official-document/ser-rp-2021d5_en.pdf","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTu_uE1e073qrAaj36BE9t1DHERwmjJF_YWVL6LOlpPUvEGN3hYvbN6QKJj2otdMeHMnHA&usqp=CAU)github.com","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/learnplatform-covid19-impact-on-digital-learning/engagement_data/5802.csv\", low_memory=False)\nprint(df.shape)\ndf.tail().style.set_properties(**{'background-color':'black',\n                                     'color': '#03e8fc'})","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-03T18:15:37.56886Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-03T18:15:37.569229Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-03T18:15:37.651222Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-03T18:15:37.569198Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-03T18:15:37.649929Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1><span class=\"label label-default\" style=\"background-color:black;border-radius:100px 100px; font-weight: bold; font-family:Garamond; font-size:20px; color:#03e8fc; padding:10px\">Nowcasting supports decision making and strategy</span></h1><br>\n\n\"Organizations of all types can use the up-to-date country and sector information produced by this new type of nowcasting model to support their decision making and shape their recovery strategies, taking into account the fact that individual sectors are affected differently in different countries and during different types of crises.\"\n\n\"For government institutions, nowcasting can provide real-time insights into the current state of the economy and the direction in which it is heading.

Verhagen -  https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2022376118\n\n\"Suspension of face-to-face instruction in schools during the COVID-19 pandemic has led to concerns about consequences for students’ learning. So far, data to study this question have been limited. Here the authors evaluate the effect of school closures on primary school performance using exceptionally rich data from The Netherlands (n ≈ 350,000).\"\n\n\"They used the fact that national examinations took place before and after lockdown and compare progress during this period to the same period in the 3 previous years. Their results reveal a learning loss of about 3 percentile points or 0.08 standard deviations.\"\n\n\"The effect is equivalent to one-fifth of a school year, the same period that schools remained closed. Losses are up to 60% larger among students from less-educated homes, confirming worries about the uneven toll of the pandemic on children and families. Investigating mechanisms, they found that most of the effect reflects the cumulative impact of knowledge learned rather than transitory influences on the day of testing. Results remain robust when balancing on the estimated propensity of treatment and using maximum-entropy weights or with fixed-effects specifications that compare students within the same school and family.\"\n\n\"The findings imply that students made little or no progress while learning from home and suggest losses even larger in countries with weaker infrastructure or longer school closures.\"\n\nhttps://www.pnas.org/content/118/17/e2022376118","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#pandas.to_datetime() is used for converting arguments to datetime.

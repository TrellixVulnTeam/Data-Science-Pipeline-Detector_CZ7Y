The percentage of students participating in digital learning has decreased in 30 out of 40 observed subgroups from before the pandemic. Engagement, however, has almost doubled, suggesting a widening gap in digital learning. The most vulnerable groups are minorities or low-income level districts; but we found that the most disadvantaged groups are making above-average improvements. **It is the second-most-disadvantaged groups that may require the most urgent help (at the end of 2020)**. Some districts which lagged in digital learning before the pandemic also face an engagement problem, as they see above-average participation increases but not as much engagement increase. \n\nIn particular, I defined the metrics **Engagement Improvement Index (EII)** and **Participation Improvement Index (PII)** to help gauge the state of digital learning in 2020. EII is the *engagement_index* of fall 2021 divided by *engagement_index* before the pandemic. **The national EII stands at 1.90**. PII is the *pct_access* in th fall divided by *pct_access* before the pandemic. **The national PII stands at 0.92**. This suggests that the COVID-19 impact on digital learning is imbalanced: while there are significant engagement improvements (90%) after the pandemic, **participation actually decreased by ~8%**. Effective policies and plans are needed to make access to digital learning more equitable. **The national EII is 0.86 excluding Virtual Classroom traffic**, suggesting an even bigger (14%) drop in participation without Virtual classroom traffic.\n\nEII and PII, together with **PPEI (Pre-Pandemic Engagement Index)** and **PPPI (Pre-Pandemic Participation Index)**, are the 4 metrics that I use to quantify the state of digital learning. They are calculated for different demographic, socioeconomic, and product usage subgroups. For example, the subgroup with a high free-or-reduced-lunch percentage is the most vulnerable group that requires attention. And with the help of decision trees, state is identified as the most important factor that affects engagement and participation. **I thus call for state-level policy accormodations to help bridge the digital gap**.\n\nNot surprisingly, virtual classroom products saw a significant increase in participation and engagement. However, Google Docs remains the most widely used product among schools. If monopoly is not a concern, **I suggest further promoting Google products in schools**. *Seesaw*, an app for portfolio-sharing among students, teachers, and parents, came out as the winner based on EII, with a 2,076 fold increase in usage. **I recommend promoting *Seesaw* in schools**. \n\nI also looked into how race, free/reduced lunch, and locale affects digital learning engagement and improvement. For pct_black/hispanic, EII is the highest in \\[0.4, 0.6\\[ group. **School districts with a considerable hispanic/black student body see a comparable (or slightly bigger) engagement improvement**. The \\[0.8, 1.0\\[ group, which has the highest hispanic/black percentage, performs well, both by engagement improvement (EII), or (absolute values of) engagement. Similar trends were observed for the free/reduced lunch dimension. For locale, Rural, Suburban, Town, and City performed in decreasing order. ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Methodology\n\n**Define reliable metrics:** I first wanted to define a few reliable metrics that could be used to answer questions related to digital engagement. *Engagement_index* and *pct_access* are inadequate because districts vary in size and other factors; a larger engagement_index value does not necessarily signify better engagement. Engagement change, which measures engagement_index or pct_access change for a district is less dependent on district size and is therefore more reliable. \n\n**Exclude outliers** I excluded 34 districts with less than 300 days of data, leaving 199. Visual inspection revealed 5 other districts that seemed to have inaccurate/unreliable data (for example, heavy usage before the summer but almost no usage in fall). They were removed from the general analysis, but may be included in more specific analyses. I also looked into two other criteria to define outliers: (1) Any school district with <365 days of data (2) Any click not corresponding to a known lip_id in products_info.csv. The first criterion would remove ~35% of districts (159 remaining); the second criterion would remove half of the clicks (22.3M to 11.7M). They were too restrictive and thus not adopted.\n\n**Decision Tree for Causal Analysis** Decision tree is usually used for prediction/classification. I showed that it can be used to identify attributes that most likely contributed to the variance in EII/PEII. \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Preparation & Data Cleansing\n\nIn this phase, I\n\n1. Import libraries, define color palette\n2. Read in all engagement data from different districts and merge them\n3. Filter out disticts with less than 300 days of data\n4. Filter out 5 outliers after visual inspection\n5. Join engagement data with district and product data\n\nIn the end, about 10% of the page load records are filtered out, leaving 20.8M records and 194 districts to be analyzed. \n\nI then plot daily page load over time to reveal 4 periods in 2020 that show distinct engagement characteristics.

We can see high correlations between the two metrics, which is not too surprising; engagement and participation are correlated. **Despite the low start, groups with low engagement/participation before the pandemic do not see larger percentage improvements.**\n\n* The second chart puts EIPP and EII on the x,y-axis. Three sub-regions are analyzed:\n* 1. **EIPP > 350**: Two states (New York and New Hampshire) and 3 high expenditure groups (20-22k, 22k-24k, 32k-34k) had a high EIPP prior to the pandemic. Current EII is also on the higher end, except for the 22k-24k expenditure group. This shows that **richer areas were more digitally engaged pre-pandemic, and saw relatively high percentage improvements during the pandemic even with a larger baseline.**  \n* 2. **200<EIPP<350**: 35% of school districts belong to this group. They are mediocre districts financially and engagement improvements are close to the national mean (1.9). \n* 3. **0<EIPP<200**: These are districts lagging behind in digital learning even before the pandemic. The impact of distanced learning varies significantly for this group. Some see a larger engagement in percentage (state=Florida, locale=city, percent_bh=\\[0.4, 0.6\\[, lunch free/reduced= \\[0.6, 0.8\\[), we note this may be due to a lower baseline. The most worrisome observation is that, **among districts lagging behind before the pandemic, more than half see improvements below average during pandemic**. \n* 4. **The Most Needy Group**: North Carolina, Tennesse, Washington, Virginia, Missouri are the 5 states that scored the worst before pandemic. Their emgagement improvement (EII) also score poorly. **Across all subgroups covering several dimensions, the subgroup that needs most lunch help (pct_free/reduced=[0.8, 1.0\\[) fares the worst**. They will need a lot of support.\n* 5. **Other low improvers:** Other subgroups that see low improvements in EII are Utah, Ohio, locale=town, and pp_total_raw=\\[6000, 8000\\[. It is surprising that **schools in towns (not rural or city) laps behind in digital improvement**. While it is understandable that **the second-lowest expenditure subgroup performed badly both pre-pandemic and in fall**, it is worth noting the lowest expenditure group (pp_total_raw=\\[6000, 8000\\[) performed decently. In addition, districts with a high black/hispanic population, who lagged behind pre-pandemic, are seeing decent (above average) improvements. \n\nMy findings may not be totally reliable for a few reasons:\n* 1. **Sample size bias**. Some subgroups have a small number of samples.\n* 2. **Sample bias**. Installation rate for LearningPlatform in different districts may not be the same. In a high engagement, low installation district, participation/engagement could be under-estimated. \n* 3. **District size bias**. Some districts are large, some are small. The pct_access based metrics may be more reliable against this type of bias. \n* 4. **Baseline bias**. Subgroups with little participation/engagement before pandemic may see a large percentage change even though the absolute change is small. We pay special attention to not draw definitie conclusions when baseline is small. \n\nDespite these biases, I feel fairly confident about most of the findings, as they are confirmed in the third figure below, where I plot PIPP and PII together.

Not only is engagement a problem, participation is one to an even more serious degree. Based on my study, I would recommend these steps: \n\n1. Focus on participation as well as engagement in promoting digital learning.\n2. For disadvantaged groups, also need to work on engagement in addition to participation. That is, once we get the stdents onto digitlal platforms, how to kep them continue using it is equally a challenge.\n3. State demographics and policies are still the most important factors affecting digital learning. We should continue pushing for more help from goverment.\n4. The most vulnerable group is high pct_free/reduced group. \n5. The most disadvantaged groups need help, but we need to help the second-most-disadvantaged groups now as they have likely been neglected in the past.\n6. Google Docs is the most popular product during the pandemic; *Seesaw* sees the largest increase in engagement percentage-wise. Both should be preferred for promotion in schools.

Below are some examples of questions that relate to our problem statement:\n    * What is the picture of digital connectivity and engagement in 2020?\n    * What is the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on online and distance learning, and how might this also evolve in the future?\n    * How does student engagement with different types of education technology change over the course of the pandemic?\n    * How does student engagement with online learning platforms relate to different geography? Demographic context (e.g., race/ethnicity, ESL, learning disability)? Learning context? Socioeconomic status?\n    * Do certain state interventions, practices or policies (e.g., stimulus, reopening, eviction moratorium) correlate with the increase or decrease online engagement?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Note: This notebook is about learning what data we have a little of cleaning and re-arranging the items.

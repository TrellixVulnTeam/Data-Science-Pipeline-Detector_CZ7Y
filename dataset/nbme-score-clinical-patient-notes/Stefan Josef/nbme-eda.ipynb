There are even 4 features with less than 10 observations.\n- Given the relatively small number of annotations, we can leverage the additional 40k patient notes without annotations for self-supervised pre-training or fine-tuning of an existing model. \n- Patient notes in the test set will be dynamically added to `patient_notes.csv` during submission, i.e. test patient notes won't be part of the pre-training corpus.\n- This implies that we should also exclude those patient notes from the pre-training corpus that will be used as validation set. When using cross-validation on the entire training set, which seems like a good idea since there aren't many annotations, we would need to exclude all annotated patient notes from pre-training.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Thanks for checking out my notebook.

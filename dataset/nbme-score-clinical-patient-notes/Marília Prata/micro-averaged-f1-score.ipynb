It might have the wrong ingredients, or not work properly, or have the potential to cause problems. It is usually the TGA that recalls medicines. It might order the pharmaceutical company to: take it off the market permanently; make a correction, such as fix a mistake in a label.\"\n\nhttps://www.healthdirect.gov.au/medicine-recalls\n\nACCURACY\n\nThe general formula for accuracy is (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN).\n\nMedicine: It may be precise but is it accurate?  By Michael Liebman\n\n\"Semantically, the terms “precision” and “accuracy” are closely linked. The definition of “precision” incorporates the concept of “accuracy.” Science, however, has effectively differentiated these concepts: “precision,” i.e., clustered around a specific value, invokes a local accuracy; “accuracy,” i.e., how far that local value may be from the true value, invokes a global accuracy. In medicine, ideally, we would like to have both, but is that achievable, given the complexity of both the underlying biology and healthcare ecosystem?\"\n\n\"While the National Institutes of Health (NIH) defines precision medicine  as “taking into account individual variability in genes, environment and lifestyle for each person,” conventionally (except for the best practitioners) it has tended to focus on genomics to identify disease biomarkers, as risk factors, diagnostics and therapeutic targets. The technologic capabilities that enable this emphasis may have a negative impact, however, on attaining global accuracy, because disease is a process and not simply a state, and methodologies to assess dynamic processes differ from those that assess static ones.\"\n\n\"It is critical in medicine to evaluate and close the gap between local and global accuracies to improve patient care and outcome and enhance efficiency and efficacy in healthcare. This requires elements of both systems- and design-thinking and is generally applicable to problems across many domains. The practice of medicine and development of both therapeutics and diagnostics have not evolved in lockstep in evolving from a reductionist approach.\"\n\nhttps://pubsonline.informs.org/do/10.1287/orms.2019.05.04/full/\n\nPRECISION, RECALL and ACCURACY\nhttps://towardsdatascience.com/multi-class-metrics-made-simple-part-i-precision-and-recall-9250280bddc2","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1><span class=\"label label-default\" style=\"background-color:black;border-radius:100px 100px; font-weight: bold; font-family:Garamond; font-size:20px; color:#03e8fc; padding:10px\">The F1- Score</span></h1><br>\n\nF1 Score:\n\nF1 Score is harmonic mean of Precision and Recall.\n\n![F1 Score](https://svgshare.com/i/M7d.svg)\n\n\nMulti-Class Metrics Made Simple, Part II: the F1-score\n\nBy Boaz Shmueli\n\n\"To calculate the micro-F1, compute micro-averaged precision and micro-averaged recall over all the samples , and then combine the two. How do we “micro-average”? Look at all the samples together. Remember that precision is the proportion of True Positives out of the Predicted Positives (TP/(TP+FP)). In the multi-class case, consider all the correctly predicted samples to be True Positives.\"\n\n\"Compute the number of False Positives.Each prediction error is a False Positive for the class that was predicted. The total number of False Positives is thus the total number of prediction errors.\n\nF1-score = 2 × (precision × recall)/(precision + recall)\n\nThe F1-score will be somewhere in between precision and recall. Though it gives a larger weight to lower numbers.\n\nhttps://towardsdatascience.com/multi-class-metrics-made-simple-part-ii-the-f1-score-ebe8b2c2ca1","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1><span class=\"label label-default\" style=\"background-color:black;border-radius:100px 100px; font-weight: bold; font-family:Garamond; font-size:20px; color:#03e8fc; padding:10px\">F1-Scores in Healthcare</span></h1><br>\n\nF1-scores should be used with care. Mostly in Healthcare.\n\n\"Although they are indeed convenient for a quick, high-level comparison, their main flaw is that they give equal weight to precision and recall.\" \n\n\"As the eminent statistician David Hand explained, “the relative importance assigned to precision and recall should be an aspect of the problem”. Classifying a sick person as healthy has a different cost from classifying a healthy person as sick, and this should be reflected in the way weights and costs are used to select the best classifier for the specific problem you are trying to solve.\"\n\n\"This is true for binary classifiers, and the problem is compounded when computing multi-class F1-scores such as macro-, weighted- or micro-F1 scores. In the multi-class case, different prediction errors have different implication. Predicting X as Y is likely to have a different cost than predicting Z as W, as so on. The standard F1-scores do not take any of the domain knowledge into account.\"\n\nhttps://towardsdatascience.com/multi-class-metrics-made-simple-part-ii-the-f1-score-ebe8b2c2ca1","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1><span class=\"label label-default\" style=\"background-color:black;border-radius:100px 100px; font-weight: bold; font-family:Garamond; font-size:20px; color:#03e8fc; padding:10px\">Evaluation Metrics</span></h1><br>\n\nA full mathematical description of evaluation metrics \n\nCitation: Rachel Stemerman, Jaime Arguello, Jane Brice, Ashok Krishnamurthy, Mary Houston, Rebecca Kitzmiller, Identification of social determinants of health using multi-label classification of electronic health record clinical notes, JAMIA Open, Volume 4, Issue 3, July 2021, ooaa069, https://doi.org/10.1093/jamiaopen/ooaa069","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://oup.silverchair-cdn.com/oup/backfile/Content_public/Journal/jamiaopen/4/3/10.1093_jamiaopen_ooaa069/1/m_ooaa069f2.jpeg?Expires=1647639849&Signature=Wi7USMK3MYnNTrfkm1zU-XesT2f4OAql68DMmc3mb6DA4ZRZUHvvR~UM7ms20ILtXrr7fTsxoeTHzknc0uuLg3JOxt-D7tmJ4XIb69ohpZo4kGMV169Z2QO3fI7P6p~neW2I14C4UdYONKvID1uAMjSFqNW2t-dsR~EKcXzgE-1EYZcYW3qzCdRNNOhmp2bbddj4yY585pSoZb0kyGb9wVXDlOLpKErrAEBRnh06TY7QenuF9fuCnu-sFIJ1Tf9kOQSr2uvwDw7ayT6WrQsggIw6oIIWTbbFFSnjj-~rqHqnP1tsCTzivC3irXXywi2l2ZKC4Wwz3eF7vHi43K1dOw__&Key-Pair-Id=APKAIE5G5CRDK6RD3PGA)https://academic.oup.com/jamiaopen/article/4/3/ooaa069/6131671?login=false","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1><span class=\"label label-default\" style=\"background-color:black;border-radius:100px 100px; font-weight: bold; font-family:Garamond; font-size:20px; color:#03e8fc; padding:10px\">Multi-label classification of electronic health record clinical notes </span></h1><br>\n\n\"Clinical notes were collected from April 2014 to December 2019, a time period that encompassed the health system’s transition to a single EHR(electronic health record).\"\n\n\"There is evidence that the model performance is associated with lexical diversity by health professionals and the auto-generation of clinical note sentences to document SDH.\"\n\nGold-standard corpora purposeful sampling\n\n\"The frequency of redundant text in clinical notes, created by copy and paste or auto-generation, undermines machine learning training and evaluation due to over representation of an SDH single occurrence.32 To derive an unbiased estimate of likely SDH documentation, we removed auto-generated and copy and paste entries that appeared to duplicate sentences.\"\n\n\"Then isolated 2 corpora (1 unigram, 1 bigram).

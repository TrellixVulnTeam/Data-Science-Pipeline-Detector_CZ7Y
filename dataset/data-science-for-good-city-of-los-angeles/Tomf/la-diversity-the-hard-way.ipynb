Requirements need to include explicit skills, required education, and implicit skills and education.  If the pool of applicants meeting those requirements is not diverse, LA will not get a diverse work force.  Example: based on accepted statistical evidence of college graduation rates, racial minorities are underrepresented.  Therefore, any posting specifying a college degree will disproportionally discourage racial minorities from applying.  More generally, any qualification which has a poor representation of diversity in the community will discourage applicants from the underrepresented populations from applying.  A simple high school diploma requirement disproportionately discourages people from the lower 25% of the income scale which is disproportionately represented by racial minorities."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In order to get a diverse work force from entry level to upper management, LA needs to make sure the community can provide a diverse set of entry-level employees, mentor all employees equally well, and adjust its expectations to account for differing methods of achieving similar results.  Achieving racial and gender diversity will take at least two generations of hard work.  Lawsuits flushed out any blatantly discriminatory wording years ago.  A word tweak to postings here and there will have no effect on the diversity of LA’s workforce."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"LAX could create a probability tree to calculate the probability of members of specific diversity groups being employed in various positions and ultimately upper management.  However, it will be an effort to prove the obvious.  A quick survey of gender and racial diversity will reveal if and where the workforce does not have diversity similar to the community.  If the workforce represents the diversity of the community, good job LA.  We will document what LA does and use it as a case study.  If LA’s employee diversity does not match the community, LA needs to work from entry level to upper management to ensure a diverse set of applicants and ensure all applicants have equal opportunity for advancement."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I’ll use the “Airport Manager” position as an example.

If all of the Department Managers are in the non-diversity group (presumably white males), the new Airport Manager will be a white male.  Similarly, if the Assistant Department Managers are disproportionately white males, the Airport Manager in 10 years will most likely be a white male; and if Line Managers are not diverse, the Airport Manager in 20 years will most likely be a white male with a predominately white male Department Manager team.  If LA wants a diverse Department Management team in 20 years, they need to make sure the Line Managers are a diverse team today."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Herein lies the problem.  Management tracks in the US almost always require a college degree.  Whether the position requires the skills developed in college is not relevant.  The degree is expected and too many other applicants have one even if the lower-level postings allow for experience to replace a degree.  Statistics from the United States overwhelmingly show the probability of a person getting a college degree is most closely related to the income level of their family.  More rich kids get degrees and rich kids are disproportionately white, therefore the diversity of management track employees will be disproportionately white.  In order to get a racially diverse group of management track employees, LA needs to ensure a racially diverse pool of college graduate which requires eliminating racial disparity in income which requires eliminating racial disparity in institutional systems including education, healthcare, and the infamous criminal justice system."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Basically, in order to ensure a diverse senior management team in 50 years, LA needs to create a diverse management track team.

Once management track diversity is in place, methods of evaluating performance will need monitoring to make sure they focus on results, and mentoring programs will need to accept the advantages of various styles of management while ensuring appropriate results are exceptionally well achieved.  In another 25 years, the diversity of the Department Managers and Assistant Department Managers should match the greater LA community.[](http://)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The above will be required to get full racial diversity.  However, gender diversity may be achievable faster by focusing on women in male-dominated fields.  If landside transportation, airside operations, and construction project management are typical backgrounds of Airport Managers, and are currently dominated by men, it may be possible to encourage women to get into the fields early on.  Construction management requires a degree in construction management, which are currently 93% male.  Getting women into construction management degree programs would require working with young women in junior high to encourage and prepare them for those college classes.  On the other hand, postings around the country for ‘Airside Operations Director’, ‘Landside Operations Manager’, or ‘Operations Manager’ positions accept Business Administration or Public Administration degrees, which do not have a gender bias.  LA could concentrate recruiting programs for landside and airside operations on women with Management degrees to diversify those feeder fields, then work with women to get them training and education in construction management.  If senior management went further to understand and work with women’s differences in managerial style, understand and work with the additional strain women are under due to family care expectations, and ensure mentorship opportunities are well managed and equally distributed, then in 25 years the senior airport managerial staff diversity along gender lines should match the greater LA community."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"LA can get an idea of their historical gender prejudice using the Accounting department.  Based on Bureau of Labor Statistics (with confirmation from my mother who was a Public Accountant from 1975 – 2015) accounting has had reasonably even representation along gender lines since before 2000 (not so much in 1975).  LA should have accurate information on the gender of accountants in the entire chain since 2000.  They can look at initial hiring and the promotions over the past two decade to see if diversity was established at hiring and maintained throughout the promotions.  If they have, it seems they are doing a good job and can continue on their diversity leadership.  If they haven’t, they can take a close look at why, work on improvements, and try to generalize those improvements to other areas."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A final observation: I am certain if a women earns a degree in construction management and comes across a Construction Management job posting stating, “He will be responsible for…”, she will apply for the job just so she can change the next posting to, “She will be responsible for…”.

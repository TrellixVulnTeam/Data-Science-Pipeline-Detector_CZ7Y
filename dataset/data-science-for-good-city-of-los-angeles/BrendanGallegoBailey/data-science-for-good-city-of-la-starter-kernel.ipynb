The job bulletin analysis would ideally cover one of the three topics below:**\n1. Identify language that can bias the pool of applicants\n2. Improve the diversity and quality of the applicant pool\n3. Increase the discoverability of promotional pathways\n\n**Lastly, make sure you code/analysis is well documented as we may use the results in the future to improve the City's hiring processes.**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Below is the standard Kaggle intro cell, which gives an explanation of the environment we're operating in as well as imports pandas, numpy, and os."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":"['cityofla']\n","name":"stdout"}]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Structuring the Job Bulletin Data into a CSV\n\nHere we're collecting data from all of the job bulletins and storing it in a CSV.\n\nThe code block below goes through all of the job bulletins, extracts the FILE_NAME and OPEN_DATE, and puts it in a list.\n\nWe're only collecting two features here, but ideally your code would collect a lot more.

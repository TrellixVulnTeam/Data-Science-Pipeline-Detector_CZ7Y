The city has partnered with Kaggle to create a competition to improve the job bulletins it will use to fill all those open positions.\nThe content, tone, and format of job descriptions can influence the quality of the applicant pool. Overly-specific requirements, for example, may discourage diversity. The Los Angeles Mayor’s Office wants to reimagine the city’s job bulletins by using text analysis to identify where they can improve.\n\n**Goal:**\nThe goal is to convert a folder full of plain-text job postings into a structured CSV file and then to use this data to:\n1. Identify language that can negatively bias the pool of applicants; \n2. Improve the diversity and quality of the applicant pool; \n3. Make it easier to determine which promotions are available to employees in each job class.\n\n**BASICALLY, TURNING A PLAIN JOB POSTING TEXT INTO A MORE DIVERSITY ATTRACTING FLYER**\n![Final job posting](https://storage.googleapis.com/kagglesdsdata/datasets/239825/508425/Job%20posting%20banner.png?GoogleAccessId=web-data@kaggle-161607.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=1561828368&Signature=X5%2BT8pPvV5DqEvdQDNTVRTG12ts8zjPY%2FkUS1ciuLGTwPfbHSeDW3JLWHTDVRa645vzBAaQ9t%2FWBV6FnjgABMwk2lT4Z68eO2sWhoItFN909HrL8GDc5gZh4%2B%2BPY7v6ILFJha579XoljQUSfo0OWmrnx%2FUIUgYiITu7dTKwlmGY0OmtCGrJMmrdbVZLUYJPcO6bT2aUnO2m0grk5Nm%2FIlPvHHCg%2FNkirlnzRDxKl10k5hqLKy%2FQ2RaweB8DFpgf0m%2B%2FsHUNVIDJHSJDFKQL%2FvqXLYNLBK0pYAXwObVZPSGLw2pG19OGp9ZV%2FzuAIBC3Fs5btby1XoIljVz7xMw7Pxw%3D%3D)\n\n\n**The Process:**\n\n[PART 1: JOB POSTING TEXT BULLETIN TO STRUCTURED CSV FILE:](https://www.kaggle.com/vicely07/sentiment-analysis-of-city-of-la-job-postings?scriptVersionId=16046935#PART-1:-JOB-POSTING-TEXT-BULLETIN-TO-STRUCTURED-CSV-FILE:):\n\n[PART 2: RAW TEXT ANALYSIS ](https://www.kaggle.com/vicely07/sentiment-analysis-of-city-of-la-job-postings?scriptVersionId=16046935#PART-2:-RAW-TEXT-ANALYSIS)\n\n[PART 3: SENTIMENT ANALYSIS](https://www.kaggle.com/vicely07/sentiment-analysis-of-city-of-la-job-postings?scriptVersionId=16046935#PART-3:-SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS:)\n\n[PART 4: SUGGESTIONS FOR DIVERSITY HIRING IMPROVEMENT](https://www.kaggle.com/vicely07/sentiment-analysis-of-city-of-la-job-postings?scriptVersionId=16046935#PART-4:-SUGGESTIONS-FOR-DIVERSITY-HIRING-IMPROVEMENT:)\n\n[PART 5: VALIDATION OF SUGGESTIONS](https://www.kaggle.com/vicely07/sentiment-analysis-of-city-of-la-job-postings?scriptVersionId=16046935#PART-5:-VALIDATION-OF-SUGGESTIONS:)\n\nPART 6: CONCLUSION\n\nREFERENCES\n\n**Note:**\nSince I am working on a jupyter notebook on my personal computer first, there are some incompatible sections when I uploaded my completed project to the Kaggle kernel.

How can we fix this readability problem?**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"One research study discovered that **the average jobseeker spends just 49.7 seconds reviewing a listing before deciding it’s not a fit.** Therefore, here're some suggestions to fix this problem: \n\n**Trimming down the job requirements to include only the must-haves:**\n\nStudies show that while men are likely to apply to jobs for which they meet only 60% of the qualifications, women are much more likely to hesitate unless they meet 100% of the listed requirements. When posting a postion, hiring managers might have a long list of qualifications for the role. However, in order to highlight your commitment to inclusion, it’s important to narrrow down to lists to only the must-haves, because many of the qualification are in the \"preferred\" categories for a perfectly fit candidates (which are rare). By trimming down the qualification, you’ll likely see an increase in applications from female candidates. If some preffered qualifications should be included in the requirement list, they should start with some soften words such as \"familiar with\", \"plus points for\", or \"if you have one of these skills\".\n\n**Avoid using jargon:**\n\nJargon and unnecessary coporate speaking language should be avoided at all cost because the job postings are written for a larger pool of general audiences. Many jargons includes terms like KPIs, procurement,P&L... Since the candidates can't understand fully the jargon and coporate terms, these word choices can make some candidates feel less qualified for a position. Jargon and corporate language in job postings will also turn off many talented young people since the posting coporation sounds like a conservative, old-fashioned institution. This problem can be easily fixed by rephrasing the words. \n\n*For example, instead of using technical, broad business terms in job description like \"core competency\", \"detail-oriented\", \"interpersonal\", aim for more universal wording, like “pays attention to details” or “personable with customers.”*"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## PART 3: SENTIMENT ANALYSIS:"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**1.

These processes can be included in a follow-up email to candidates who actually apply to the job.\n\nIn addition, many studies has found that the language you use in a job description can significantly attract or turn off diverse candidates from applying to the listed position. To attract more female candidates, avoid using too many “masculine” words (ambitious, dominate, challenging ...) in the job postings. "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**2. Show your existing workplace diversity (or the diversity you aspire to):**\n\nGlassdoor found that 67% of job seekers use diversity is an important factor when considering companies and job offers. One of the biggest effective way to increase workplace diversity is showing diversity at your workplace itself. \nIn February of 2018, Mayor Eric Garcetti today did a really good job in creating a social media campaign that highlighted diversity in the Los Angeles Police Department and encourage more Angelenos to consider careers in the LAPD. One of the photo banner from this campaign shows different LAPD employees holding paper signs telling their unique personal stories (the picture attached below). The city of LA can work on a similar campaign with real employees from each department. \n\n![](https://storage.googleapis.com/kagglesdsdata/datasets/239299/507558/Diversity.png?GoogleAccessId=web-data@kaggle-161607.iam.gserviceaccount.com&Expires=1561828777&Signature=m4cHD6OuJzqKEHOrpi7J6UiWsGLaNNtN26WCE3OSzmlH9bWOGMqQOkpmLT%2BvlSOQx5Arh%2FOMEWXqXTqY8kwnWiUoMORXkInoEoo9GoJ%2Bs0M35cqLJVgyS5O8rWeLTaGT072H1jMsrydDWteQ4R%2FDdPTdfnn6gbM74oiSDkGCjUovmmqqDSeDsnDaKV2gd9pQosnxx0NKdE5yyC%2B9CnBUV6GNwi%2BScBIg4bfpIONMaNOS7Hrxima9BpmhoAHJ6%2FCeSZWVCSY8PjFF3HnD7alEzg2RNfdr8y0yDgEvgcMJYx2GqpRHjgUwvTpgllQJWwS4J4P7h8XluNboiFnO%2Bl31hA%3D%3D)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**3.

Then, we use this new csv table and the normalized text files for the purpose of calculating ngrams of most frequently appeared words, plotting the distribution of text length, word clouds and sentiment analysis of the ngrams. From our analytics, we can see that the job posting texts are lenghty in words, have low readability scores, contain many negative words. \nBy focusing on fixing the length of the text, filtering out the negative words, adding a some other suggestions on promoting the company's mission and commitment to diversity hiring, we then validate our suggestions by running the metrics from our analysis on the new text. In our last step, we add graphic and reformat the plain text into a neat and clean job posting. This new job posting can play a key part helping the city of LA to meet their goal in diversity hiring the future.

Similar to an online retailer who displays similar items for sale, we will display similar jobs available.\n\nIn practice, this will increase the number of applicants the City of Los Angeles receives.  This will also aid applicants in navigating what may be thousands of available positions.\n\n### Example Results\n\nAs this process finds similar jobs, here are a few examples demonstrating the value:\n\n| Job | Similar Job |\n|---|---|\n| MEDICAL ASSISTANT | LICENSED VOCATIONAL NURSE |\n| PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTANT | DEPARTMENTAL CHIEF ACCOUNTANT |\n\n### Approach\n\nThe approach is to use natual language processing (NLP) methods to compare the job description of all provided jobs.  We will use term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency to represent a job description as a numeric vector.  Then, we will compare each vector to all other vectors using cosine similarity.  The result will be an \"rating\" of how similar job descriptions are to one another.  Finally, we will filter those \"ratings\" for the highest value, which will represent the most similar job description."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Imports\nimport pandas as pd\nimport os","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We will use the \"DUTIES\" section of the job bulletins for our work.

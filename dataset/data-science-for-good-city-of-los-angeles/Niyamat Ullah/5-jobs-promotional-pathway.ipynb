Put more simply that we have to find all the possible promotional pathway an employer can traverse given a job. \n\nThe solution to this problem is mostly done in part 2 where we extracted the data field and build a structured CSV dataset of the job description. There is a column name ```EXP_JOB_CLASS_TITLE```. It's store the title of the job that one must experience with to have that job. We can use this information to build our promotional graph.

Using that column value we can easily match with job duties to a given job title and from that we can create promotion graph.\n<p/>\n</div>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <font color=\"#5831bc\" face=\"Comic Sans MS\">Conclusion</font>\nWe finally came to the end of my solutions. I thank you very much for reading my solutions to this competition. Hope you enjoyed it. I also learned a lot while working on this competition. It has a unique problem that taught different knowledge. \n\nAt last, I want to describe the features of this solution in the lights of grading rubric provided by Kaggle. \n\n<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n<p/>\n<b>Accuracy:</b><br/>\n    • Successfully converted the folder of job postings into a structured CSV. The quality of the CSV is better than any other CSV shared in the forums. Because in forums, all the people used regex by giving a certain pattern. But there were hundreds of patterns to give. So sometimes it will not work. For randomized and new jobs, using regex will fail at some point, my solutions use NER that can be used for new jobs. <br/>\n<p/>\n<b>Documentation:</b><br/>\n    • Provided comment for most of the code so that it can be understood what it's doing. <br/>\n    • Followed industry best coding practices. I build necessary functions and methods for reuse and readability, that can be used in the production of the City of LA. <br/>\n    • Also, provided extensive documentation of my methodology. I describe every techniques/library I used in my solutions. <br/>\n<p/>\n<b>Recommendation:</b><br/>\n    • Used the structured CSV file for doing all my analysis. <br/>\n    • Have made extensive EDA on structured CSV and found very insightful stories. I documented those in my solutions and provided recommendations with each of my findings. Also, all the recommendations, are actionable by the City of LA. For example. I found that masculine-coded jobs are higher and find popular masculine coded words, that the City of LA easily can improve on.<br/>\n    • Use of machine learning model for identifying biased language also an interesting and useful technique that I shared with my solutions. That easily can use for a more complex identification of biased language. <br/>\n</div>\n\nThis is end of my solutions. Hope you enjoyed it! Feel free to comment, upvote! Thank you very much!

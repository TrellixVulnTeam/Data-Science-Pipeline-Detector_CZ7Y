Since this is \"data for good\" I think it's better if any of us can get closer to the City of LA's goals for this data and sharing can get us there faster.\n\nAlso some quick observations:\n\n* I thought it was intersting that some Kagglers start with a dataframe with all columns with null values that they then replace with actual values (see an [example](https://www.kaggle.com/jazivxt/a-freakonomics-opportunity)) this looks like a nice way to stay organized\n* There are lots of fields that weren't identified by the City of LA in their data dictionary, it'll be interesting to see we can make of the new additions, I've listed those below too.\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Fields listed in City of LA Data

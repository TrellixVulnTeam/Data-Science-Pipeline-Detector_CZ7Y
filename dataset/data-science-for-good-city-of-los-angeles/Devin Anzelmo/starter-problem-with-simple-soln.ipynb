{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Notebook provides a toy example of how I think this problem should be solved. This is a very simple solution. I have read the job descriptions manually and selected only one job tree to start with. There is a lot of automation and extension to this possible. It currently doesn't handle certifications or education requirements at all. For a description of the problem I think we are solving see this kernel: https://www.kaggle.com/devinanzelmo/exploring-problem-statement which has a copy of the problem statement that I based the following soln on. \n\n\nThis is v1 first draft, lots of work to do. Meaning this is unfinished. \n\nPlease see this pdf for diagram of this problem. \n`../input/cityofla/CityofLA/Additional\\ data/City\\ Job\\ Paths/Tree_Surgeon.pdf`\n\nIf anyone wants to fork, and make this prettier please feel free. I will of course use your work in the future.

You can apply facial analysis with just a few lines of code. It is fully open source and available on PyPI. All you need is to call **pip install deepface** command.\n\nIt supports the most popular face recognition models including **VGG-Face**, **Google FaceNet**, **OpenFace**, **Facebook DeepFace**,**DeepID**, **Dlib** and **ArcFace**. Besides, it can analyze facial attributes such as **emotion**, **age**, **gender** and **race** prediction as well in its facial attribute analysis module.\n\nGitHub repo: https://github.com/serengil/deepface\n\nThere are many ways to support a project - starring⭐️ it is just one.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom pathlib import Path\nimport zipfile\nimport cv2\nimport tqdm\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport itertools","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-30T12:38:59.506971Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-30T12:38:59.507383Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-30T12:38:59.513191Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-30T12:38:59.507321Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-30T12:38:59.512073Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"ls\n","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-30T12:36:38.733642Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-30T12:36:38.734265Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-30T12:36:39.483516Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-30T12:36:38.734193Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-30T12:36:39.482416Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Deepface will download pre-trained weights from Google Drive source but I copied weights in the inputs to skip downloading step","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"home = str(Path.home())\nprint(\"HOME_FOLDER is \", home)\n\nif not os.path.exists(home+\"/.deepface\"):\n    os.mkdir(home+\"/.deepface\")\n    \nif not os.path.exists(home+\"/.deepface/weights\"):    \n    os.mkdir(home+\"/.deepface/weights\")\n\n#os.listdir('../input/pretrained-models')\n\nimport shutil\n\nshutil.copy(\"../input/pretrained-models/vgg_face_weights.h5\", home+\"/.deepface/weights\")\nshutil.copy(\"../input/pretrained-models/facenet_weights.h5\", home+\"/.deepface/weights\")\nshutil.copy(\"../input/pretrained-models/arcface_weights.h5\", home+\"/.deepface/weights\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-30T12:36:39.48519Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-30T12:36:39.48556Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-30T12:36:50.228673Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-30T12:36:39.485501Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-30T12:36:50.226208Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"pd.set_option('display.max_rows', 500)\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', 500)\npd.set_option('display.width', 1000)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-30T12:36:50.232874Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-30T12:36:50.235303Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-30T12:36:50.242743Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-30T12:36:50.23522Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-30T12:36:50.240512Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"TRAIN_ZIP = '../input/recognizing-faces-in-the-wild/train.zip'\nTEST_ZIP='../input/recognizing-faces-in-the-wild/test.zip'","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-30T12:36:50.246865Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-30T12:36:50.247217Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-30T12:36:50.307079Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-30T12:36:50.247167Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-30T12:36:50.304356Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"unzipping train set\")\nwith zipfile.ZipFile(TRAIN_ZIP, 'r') as zip_ref:\n    zip_ref.extractall(\"../output/kaggle/working/train\")\n\nprint(\"unzipping test set\")\nwith zipfile.ZipFile(TEST_ZIP, 'r') as zip_ref:\n    zip_ref.extractall(\"../output/kaggle/working/test\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-30T12:36:50.309675Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-30T12:36:50.309994Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-30T12:36:55.852851Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-30T12:36:50.30995Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-30T12:36:55.851809Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/recognizing-faces-in-the-wild/train_relationships.csv\")\ndf['related'] = 1\ndf.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-30T12:36:55.854431Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-30T12:36:55.854796Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-30T12:36:55.91818Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-30T12:36:55.854745Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-30T12:36:55.91409Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Train relationships file show folders for related ones.

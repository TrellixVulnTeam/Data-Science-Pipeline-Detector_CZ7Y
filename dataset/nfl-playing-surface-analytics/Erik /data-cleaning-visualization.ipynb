As a novice in the Kaggle environment, I think this is a good oportunity to present the motivations that lead me to focus on the Data Science Field, especially in its applications to sports. I think that the main goal of Data Science is improving the quality of life of the people. At least, that is the vision that I have. So the natural course is using the data in the field of professional sport: with the data, we can study about the injuries that ends promising careers of athletes and how to avoid them; about how can we improve their performance on the field and consequently their satisfaction and self esteem (mental health has a great impact on the efficiency of these athletes too); in conclusion, we study about how can we improve their security and well-being.

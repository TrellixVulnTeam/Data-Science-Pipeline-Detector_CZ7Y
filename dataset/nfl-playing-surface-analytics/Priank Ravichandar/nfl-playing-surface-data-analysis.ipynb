Three different files in .csv format are provided, documenting injuries, player-plays, and player movement during plays:\n\n- Injury Record: The injury record file in .csv format contains information on 105 lower-limb injuries that occurred during regular season games over the two seasons. Injuries can be linked to specific records in a player's history using the PlayerKey, GameID, and PlayKey fields.\n\n- Play List: – The play list file contains the details for the 267,005 player-plays that make up the dataset. Each player is indexed by PlayerKey, GameID, and PlayKey fields. Details about the game and play include the player’s assigned roster position, stadium type, field type, weather, play type, position for the play, and position group.\n\n- Player Track Data: player level data that describes the location, orientation, speed, and direction of each player during a play recorded at 10 Hz (i.e. 10 observations recorded per second).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-20T17:42:40.708345Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-20T17:42:40.70882Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-20T17:42:41.651904Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-20T17:42:40.708681Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-20T17:42:41.651118Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"injury_df = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-playing-surface-analytics/InjuryRecord.csv')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-20T17:42:59.341228Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-20T17:42:59.341594Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-20T17:42:59.361879Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-20T17:42:59.341559Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-20T17:42:59.360917Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"play_list_df = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-playing-surface-analytics/PlayList.csv')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-20T17:43:00.825085Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-20T17:43:00.825429Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-20T17:43:01.642866Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-20T17:43:00.825397Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-20T17:43:01.641912Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"player_track_df = pd.read_csv('../input/nfl-playing-surface-analytics/PlayerTrackData.csv')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-20T17:43:03.284345Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-20T17:43:03.28468Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-20T17:44:48.465201Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-20T17:43:03.28465Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-20T17:44:48.463671Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"injury_df.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-20T17:45:06.067597Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-20T17:45:06.067993Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-20T17:45:06.10537Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-20T17:45:06.067952Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-20T17:45:06.104272Z"},"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"play_list_df.head()","metadata":{"scrolled":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-20T17:45:23.356043Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-20T17:45:23.356398Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-20T17:45:23.375432Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-20T17:45:23.356365Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-20T17:45:23.373994Z"},"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"player_track_df.head(15)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-20T17:45:23.983648Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-20T17:45:23.984002Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-20T17:45:24.008921Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-20T17:45:23.983967Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-20T17:45:24.007541Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Cleaning and Preparation\nIn this stage the data is checked for accuracy and completeness prior to beginning the analysis. \n\n- Remove extraneous data\n- Check for in missing values\n- Replace missing values\n- Delete data that cannot be corrected/replaced\n- Correct any data formatting issues\n- Creating new features\n- Identify errors revealed when new variables are created\n\n## Removing Extraneous Data\n\n### Play List","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"play_list_df.info()","metadata":{"scrolled":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-20T17:45:47.42468Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-20T17:45:47.425037Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-20T17:45:47.602821Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-20T17:45:47.425001Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-20T17:45:47.601748Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There are a significant number of rows in play_list_df.

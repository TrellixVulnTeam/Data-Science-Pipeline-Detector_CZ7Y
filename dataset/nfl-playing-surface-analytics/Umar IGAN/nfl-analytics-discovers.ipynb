Comparing missed days, injuried body part and surface with bar charts.\n4. Looking for location of events, injuried body part and surface over the game field with scatter plots.\n5. Looking for event types change during the game with horizontal bar chart.\n6. Looking for the players movement during all game and just before getting injuried\n7. Looking for acceleration change and mean difference of speed, distance and acceleration."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":" ### Importing the libraries"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport seaborn as sns #visualization\nimport plotly.express as px #visualization\nimport chart_studio.plotly as py #visualization\nimport plotly.figure_factory as ff #visualization\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go #visualization\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt #visualization\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Injury Record"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"Injurydf=pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/nfl-playing-surface-analytics/InjuryRecord.csv')\nInjurydf","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## PlayList "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* now lets look at Playlist data to see what we can mine from it."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"Playdf=pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/nfl-playing-surface-analytics/PlayList.csv')\nPlaydf","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* Fixing typos in StadiumType"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"Playdf['StadiumType']=Playdf['StadiumType'].replace(to_replace =['Outdoors', 'Outddors', 'Oudoors','Oudoor', 'Dome', 'Indoor'], \n                            value =[\"Outdoor\", \"Outdoor\", \"Outdoor\",\"Outdoor\",  \"Indoors\", \"Indoors\"])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"*  Visualizing some features after merge PlayList with InjuryRecord to see the patterns between Playlist features and number of Injuried players "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plays=list(Injurydf['PlayerKey'].unique())\nPlaydf_Copy=Playdf[Playdf.PlayerKey.isin(plays)]\nPlaydf_Copy","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"last_row0=Playdf_Copy.groupby('PlayerKey').tail(1)\nrp=last_row0['StadiumType'].value_counts()\nx1=rp[:5].index\ny1=rp[:5].values\n\nst=last_row0['Position'].value_counts()\nx2=st[:5].index\ny2=st[:5].values\n\nwt=last_row0['RosterPosition'].value_counts()\nx3=wt[:5].index\ny3=wt[:5].values\n\npt=last_row0['PlayType'].value_counts()\nx4=pt[:5].index\ny4=pt[:5].values\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.subplots_adjust(left=0.005, bottom=0.01, right=2.5, top=2.1)\nplt.subplot(2, 2, 1)\nsns.barplot(x1, y1)\nplt.title('StadiumType',fontsize=20)\nplt.ylabel('Number')\nplt.subplot(2, 2, 2)\nplt.title('RosterPosition', fontsize=20)\nsns.barplot(x3, y3)\nplt.ylabel('Number')\nplt.subplot(2, 2, 3)\nsns.barplot(x2, y2)\nplt.title('Position', fontsize=20)\nplt.ylabel('Number')\nplt.subplot(2, 2, 4)\nplt.title('PlayType', fontsize=20)\nsns.barplot(x4, y4)\nplt.ylabel('Number')\n\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"* You can see PlayType, Position, RosterPosition and StadiumType comparing with number of injuries which can help us to enlighten us about which value causes most injury.

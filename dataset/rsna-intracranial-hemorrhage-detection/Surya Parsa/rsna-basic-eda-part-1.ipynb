For example, intracranial hemorrhages account for approximately 10% of strokes in the U.S., where stroke is the fifth-leading cause of death. Identifying the location and type of any hemorrhage present is a critical step in treating the patient.\n\nDiagnosis requires an urgent procedure. When a patient shows acute neurological symptoms such as severe headache or loss of consciousness, highly trained specialists review medical images of the patientâ€™s cranium to look for the presence, location and type of hemorrhage. The process is complicated and often time consuming."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<b>What am i predicting?</b><br/><br/>\nIn this competition our goal is to predict intracranial hemorrhage and its subtypes.

Symptoms include sudden tingling, weakness, numbness, paralysis, severe headache, difficulty with swallowing or vision, loss of balance or coordination, difficulty understanding, speaking , reading, or writing, and a change in level of consciousness or alertness, marked by stupor, lethargy, sleepiness, or coma. Any type of bleeding inside the skull or brain is a medical emergency. It is important to get the person to a hospital emergency room immediately to determine the cause of the bleeding and begin medical treatment."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<b>Types</b>\n<br/>\n1.

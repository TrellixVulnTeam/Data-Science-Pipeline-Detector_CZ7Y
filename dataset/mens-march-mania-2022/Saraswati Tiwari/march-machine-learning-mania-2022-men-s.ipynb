We can even evaluate and compare different approaches by seeing which of them would have done best at predicting tournament games from the past.\nDefine  state represent point process with simple graphical medel.\nCalculate each transiction probabilities to use detail data, calculate transiction probabilities and create transiction matrix Monte-Carlo simulation.\n\n#### What we learned while making this notebook?\nIn stage one of this two-stage competition, participants will build and test their models against previous tournaments. In the second stage, participants will predict the outcome of the 2022 tournament. You don’t need to participate in the first stage to enter the second. The first stage exists to incentivize model building and provide a means to score predictions. The real competition is forecasting the 2022 results.\n\n#### Why are you trying it?\n- Simple method of using regular seasons win-loss between pairs of team as probability of winning.\n- For instance, if team A and team B has 5 matches in total and team A wins out of 5, the probability of team A wins out of 5, the probability of team A winning is 0.6.\n\nProbability of winning is 0.5 if A and B has no historical matchup.\n\n- Loading necessities\n- Exploratory data analysis\n- Feature engineering \n- Create train and test sets\n- Modelling and verify

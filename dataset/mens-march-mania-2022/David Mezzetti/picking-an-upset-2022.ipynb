It's something special when a double digit team beats a highly ranked team, one of the most exciting events in sports. One strategy with the Kaggle competition is taking a couple risks with submissions. A very good model may place in the top 10% but often it comes down to luck in terms of placing high in the leaderboard. Taking a calculated risk.\n\nWith the submission deadline coming, one strategy could be to take a chance on a couple different games to attempt to differentiate a submission. Rather than guessing, let's look at the data and see if there are any picks that are better than others. We'll start with plotting the frequency of upsets.

For each season, the file includes all games played from DayNum 0 through 132. It is important to realize that the \"Regular Season\" games are simply defined to be all games played on DayNum=132 or earlier (DayNum=133 is Selection Monday). Thus a game played before Selection Monday will show up here whether it was a pre-season tournament, a non-conference game, a regular conference game, a conference tournament game, or whatever.\n\n* Season - this is the year of the associated entry in WSeasons.csv (the year in which the final tournament occurs). For example, during the 2016 season, there were regular season games played between November 2015 and March 2016, and all of those games will show up with a Season of 2016.\n* DayNum - this integer always ranges from 0 to 132, and tells you what day the game was played on. It represents an offset from the \"DayZero\" date in the \"WSeasons.csv\" file. For example, the first game in the file was DayNum=18. Combined with the fact from the \"WSeasons.csv\" file that day zero was 10/27/1997 that year, this means the first game was played 18 days later, or 11/14/1997. There are no teams that ever played more than one game on a given date, so you can use this fact if you need a unique key (combining Season and DayNum and WTeamID).\n* WTeamID - this identifies the id number of the team that won the game, as listed in the \"WTeams.csv\" file. No matter whether the game was won by the home team or visiting team, or if it was a neutral-site game, the \"WTeamID\" always identifies the winning team.\n* WScore - this identifies the number of points scored by the winning team.\n* LTeamID - this identifies the id number of the team that lost the game.\n* LScore - this identifies the number of points scored by the losing team. Thus you can be confident that WScore will be greater than LScore for all games listed.\n* NumOT - this indicates the number of overtime periods in the game, an integer 0 or higher.\n* WLoc - this identifies the \"location\" of the winning team. If the winning team was the home team, this value will be \"H\". If the winning team was the visiting team, this value will be \"A\". If it was played on a neutral court, then this value will be \"N\". Sometimes it is unclear whether the site should be considered neutral, since it is near one team's home court, or even on their court during a tournament, but for this determination we have simply used the Kenneth Massey data in its current state, where the \"@\" sign is either listed with the winning team, the losing team, or neither team. If you would like to investigate this factor more closely, we invite you to explore Data Section 3, which provides the city that each game was played in, irrespective of whether it was considered to be a neutral site.","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"6150f462-8eb1-44a6-b79c-3b79ca44a3f9","_uuid":"f15a8f96-8b80-40ea-a38b-0c816635c96b","papermill":{"duration":0.029655,"end_time":"2022-02-19T10:29:44.624054","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-02-19T10:29:44.594399","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"WRegularSeasonCompactResults

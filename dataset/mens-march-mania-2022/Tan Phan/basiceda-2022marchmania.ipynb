For the other two regions, whichever region's name comes first alphabetically, that region will be Region Y, and the other will be Region Z. This allows us to identify the regions and brackets in a standardized way in other files, even if the region names change from year to year. For instance, during the 2012 tournament, the four regions were East, Midwest, South, and West. Being the first alphabetically, East becomes W. Since the East regional champion (Ohio State) played against the Midwest regional champion (Kansas) in the national semifinals, that makes Midwest be region X. For the other two (South and West), since South comes first alphabetically, that makes South Y and therefore West is Z. So for that season, the W/X/Y/Z are East,Midwest,South,West.

There are no teams that ever played more than one game on a given date, so you can use this fact if you need a unique key (combining Season and DayNum and WTeamID). In order to accomplish this uniqueness, we had to adjust one game's date. In March 2008, the SEC postseason tournament had to reschedule one game (Georgia-Kentucky) to a subsequent day because of a tornado, so Georgia had to actually play two games on the same day.

The information was gathered by Kenneth Massey and provided on his [College Basketball Ranking Composite page](https://www.masseyratings.com/cb/compare.htm).\n\nNote that a rating system is more precise than a ranking system, because a rating system can provide insight about the strength gap between two adjacently-ranked teams. A ranking system will just tell you who is #1 or who is #2, but a rating system might tell you whether the gap between #1 and #2 is large or small. Nevertheless, it can be hard to compare two different rating systems that are expressed in different scales, so it can be very useful to express all the systems in terms of their ordinal ranking (1, 2, 3, ..., N) of teams.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"MMasseyOrdinals =pd.read_csv(DATA_PATH + 'MMasseyOrdinals.csv')\nMMasseyOrdinals.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-16T04:58:57.636721Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-16T04:58:57.637245Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-16T04:59:00.692544Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-16T04:58:57.637197Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-16T04:59:00.691508Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# To be continued","metadata":{}}]}

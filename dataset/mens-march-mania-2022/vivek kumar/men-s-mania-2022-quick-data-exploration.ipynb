The information was gathered by Kenneth Massey and provided on his College Basketball Ranking Composite page.\n\nNote that a rating system is more precise than a ranking system, because a rating system can provide insight about the strength gap between two adjacently-ranked teams. A ranking system will just tell you who is #1 or who is #2, but a rating system might tell you whether the gap between #1 and #2 is large or small. Nevertheless, it can be hard to compare two different rating systems that are expressed in different scales, so it can be very useful to express all the systems in terms of their ordinal ranking (1, 2, 3, ..., N) of teams.\n\n* **Season** - this is the year of the associated entry in MSeasons.csv (the year in which the final tournament occurs)\n* **RankingDayNum** - this integer always ranges from 0 to 133, and is expressed in the same terms as a game's DayNum (where DayZero is found in the MSeasons.csv file). The RankingDayNum is intended to tell you the first day that it is appropriate to use the rankings for predicting games. For example, if RankingDayNum is 110, then the rankings ought to be based upon game outcomes up through DayNum=109, and so you can use the rankings to make predictions of games on DayNum=110 or later. The final pre-tournament rankings each year have a RankingDayNum of 133, and can thus be used to make predictions of the games from the NCAA® tournament, which start on DayNum=134 (the Tuesday after Selection Sunday).\n* **SystemName** - this is the (usually) 3-letter abbreviation for each distinct ranking system. These systems may evolve from year to year, but as a general rule they retain their meaning across the years. Near the top of the Massey composite page, you can find slightly longer labels describing each system, along with links to the underlying pages where the latest rankings are provided (and sometimes the calculation is described).\n* **TeamID** - this is the ID of the team being ranked, as described in MTeams.csv.\n* **OrdinalRank** - this is the overall ranking of the team in the underlying system.

As an example of the format of the seed, the first record in the file is seed W01 from 1985, which means we are looking at the #1 seed in the W region (which we can see from the \"MSeasons.csv\" file was the East region).\n* **TeamID** - this identifies the id number of the team, as specified in the MTeams.csv file","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"MNCAATourneySeeds.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T09:25:23.310913Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T09:25:23.311344Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T09:25:23.325038Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T09:25:23.31131Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T09:25:23.324486Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Total Seasons: {}\".format(MNCAATourneySeeds.Season.nunique()))\nprint(\"Seeds Count: {}\".format(MNCAATourneySeeds.Seed.nunique()))\nprint(\"Unique TeamID: {}\".format(MNCAATourneySeeds.TeamID.nunique()))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T09:33:25.486229Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T09:33:25.486946Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T09:33:25.497359Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T09:33:25.486911Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T09:33:25.496238Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = plt.figure(figsize=(5, 10))\nsns.countplot(data=MNCAATourneySeeds, y='Season');\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T09:33:35.906458Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T09:33:35.907151Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T09:33:36.287409Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T09:33:35.907115Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T09:33:36.28662Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = plt.figure(figsize=(5, 20))\nsns.countplot(data=MNCAATourneySeeds, y='Seed');\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T09:33:46.124743Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T09:33:46.125041Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T09:33:47.301103Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T09:33:46.12501Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T09:33:47.30025Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# MNCAATourneySlots\nThis file identifies the mechanism by which teams are paired against each other, depending upon their seeds, as the tournament proceeds through its rounds. It can be of use in identifying, for a given historical game, what round it occurred in, and what the seeds/slots were for the two teams (the meaning of \"slots\" is described below). Because of the existence of play-in games for particular seed numbers, the pairings have small differences from year to year. You may need to know these specifics if you are trying to represent/simulate the exact workings of the tournament bracket.\n\n* **Season** - this is the year of the associated entry in MSeasons.csv (the year in which the final tournament occurs)\n* **Slot** - this uniquely identifies one of the tournament games. For play-in games, it is a three-character string identifying the seed fulfilled by the winning team, such as W16 or Z13. For regular tournament games, it is a four-character string, where the first two characters tell you which round the game is (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, or R6) and the second two characters tell you the expected seed of the favored team. Thus the first row is R1W1, identifying the Round 1 game played in the W bracket, where the favored team is the 1 seed. As a further example, the R2W1 slot indicates the Round 2 game that would have the 1 seed from the W bracket, assuming that all favored teams have won up to that point. Even if that R2W1 slot were actually a game between the W09 and W16 teams, it is still considered to be the R2W1 slot. The slot names are different for the final two rounds, where R5WX identifies the national semifinal game between the winners of regions W and X, and R5YZ identifies the national semifinal game between the winners of regions Y and Z, and R6CH identifies the championship game. The \"slot\" value is used in other columns in order to represent the advancement and pairings of winners of previous games.\n* **StrongSeed** - this indicates the expected stronger-seeded team that plays in this game. For Round 1 games, a team seed is identified in this column (as listed in the \"Seed\" column in the MNCAATourneySeeds.csv file), whereas for subsequent games, a slot is identified in this column. In the first record of this file (slot R1W1), we see that seed W01 is the \"StrongSeed\", which during the 1985 tournament would have been Georgetown. Whereas for games from Round 2 or later, rather than a team seed, we will see a \"slot\" referenced in this column. So in the 33rd record of this file (slot R2W1), it tells us that the winners of slots R1W1 and R1W8 will face each other in Round 2. Of course, in the last few games of the tournament - the national semifinals and finals - it's not really meaningful to talk about a \"strong seed\" or \"weak seed\", since you would have #1 seeds favored to face each other, but those games are nevertheless represented in the same format for the sake of consistency.\n* **WeakSeed** - this indicates the expected weaker-seeded team that plays in this game, assuming all favored teams have won so far. For Round 1 games, a team seed is identified in this column (as listed in the \"Seed\" column in the MNCAATourneySeeds.csv file), whereas for subsequent games, a slot is identified in this column.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"MNCAATourneySlots.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T09:25:23.325908Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T09:25:23.326519Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T09:25:23.343401Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T09:25:23.326483Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T09:25:23.342585Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# MRegularSeasonCompactResults\nThis file identifies the game-by-game results for many seasons of historical data, starting with the 1985 season (the first year the NCAA® had a 64-team tournament). For each season, the file includes all games played from DayNum 0 through 132. It is important to realize that the \"Regular Season\" games are simply defined to be all games played on DayNum=132 or earlier (DayNum=132 is Selection Sunday, and there are always a few conference tournament finals actually played early in the day on Selection Sunday itself). Thus a game played on or before Selection Sunday will show up here whether it was a pre-season tournament, a non-conference game, a regular conference game, a conference tournament game, or whatever.\n\n* **Season** - this is the year of the associated entry in MSeasons.csv (the year in which the final tournament occurs). For example, during the 2016 season, there were regular season games played between November 2015 and March 2016, and all of those games will show up with a Season of 2016.\n* **DayNum** - this integer always ranges from 0 to 132, and tells you what day the game was played on. It represents an offset from the \"DayZero\" date in the \"MSeasons.csv\" file. For example, the first game in the file was DayNum=20. Combined with the fact from the \"MSeasons.csv\" file that day zero was 10/29/1984 that year, this means the first game was played 20 days later, or 11/18/1984. There are no teams that ever played more than one game on a given date, so you can use this fact if you need a unique key (combining Season and DayNum and WTeamID). In order to accomplish this uniqueness, we had to adjust one game's date. In March 2008, the SEC postseason tournament had to reschedule one game (Georgia-Kentucky) to a subsequent day because of a tornado, so Georgia had to actually play two games on the same day. In order to enforce this uniqueness, we moved the game date for the Georgia-Kentucky game back to its original scheduled date.\n* **WTeamID** - this identifies the id number of the team that won the game, as listed in the \"MTeams.csv\" file. No matter whether the game was won by the home team or visiting team, or if it was a neutral-site game, the \"WTeamID\" always identifies the winning team.\n* **WScore** - this identifies the number of points scored by the winning team.\n* **LTeamID** - this identifies the id number of the team that lost the game.\n* **LScore** - this identifies the number of points scored by the losing team. Thus you can be confident that WScore will be greater than LScore for all games listed.\n* **WLoc** - this identifies the \"location\" of the winning team. If the winning team was the home team, this value will be \"H\". If the winning team was the visiting team, this value will be \"A\". If it was played on a neutral court, then this value will be \"N\". Sometimes it is unclear whether the site should be considered neutral, since it is near one team's home court, or even on their court during a tournament, but for this determination we have simply used the Kenneth Massey data in its current state, where the \"@\" sign is either listed with the winning team, the losing team, or neither team. If you would like to investigate this factor more closely, we invite you to explore Data Section 3, which provides the city that each game was played in, irrespective of whether it was considered to be a neutral site.\n* **NumOT** - this indicates the number of overtime periods in the game, an integer 0 or higher.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"MRegularSeasonCompactResults.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T09:25:23.344554Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T09:25:23.344789Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T09:25:23.361615Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T09:25:23.344761Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T09:25:23.360962Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Toal Seasons:{}\".format(MRegularSeasonCompactResults.Season.nunique()))\nMRegularSeasonCompactResults.Season.value_counts().sort_index()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T09:34:17.542946Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T09:34:17.543391Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T09:34:17.558817Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T09:34:17.543361Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T09:34:17.557978Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = plt.figure(figsize=(5, 5))\nsns.countplot(data=MRegularSeasonCompactResults, x='WLoc');\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T09:34:27.787537Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T09:34:27.787784Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T09:34:28.135757Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T09:34:27.787755Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T09:34:28.134988Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = plt.figure(figsize=(5, 5))\nsns.countplot(data=MRegularSeasonCompactResults, x='NumOT');\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T09:34:36.334745Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T09:34:36.335045Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T09:34:36.542009Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T09:34:36.335014Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T09:34:36.541095Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = plt.figure(figsize=(5, 10))\nsns.countplot(data=MRegularSeasonCompactResults, y='Season');\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T09:34:44.996505Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T09:34:44.996789Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T09:34:45.389121Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T09:34:44.996758Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T09:34:45.388337Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\nsns.histplot(MRegularSeasonCompactResults.groupby(\"WTeamID\").apply(lambda x: len(x)).values, bins=25);\nplt.title(\"Distribution of total number of wins by each teams\")\nplt.show();","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T09:35:01.492487Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T09:35:01.492794Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T09:35:01.763441Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T09:35:01.492761Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T09:35:01.762897Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# MRegularSeasonDetailedResults\nThis file provides team-level box scores for many regular seasons of historical data, starting with the 2003 season.

For any teams that are currently Division-I, they will be listed with LastD1Season=2022, and you can confirm there are 358 such teams.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"MTeams.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T09:25:23.451192Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T09:25:23.451541Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T09:25:23.463043Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T09:25:23.451499Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T09:25:23.462228Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print('Unique Team IDs: {}'.format(MTeams.TeamID.nunique()))\nprint('Unique TeamName: {}'.format(MTeams.TeamName.nunique()))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T09:25:23.464438Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T09:25:23.465328Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T09:25:23.475742Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T09:25:23.465282Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T09:25:23.474881Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = plt.figure(figsize=(5, 10))\nsns.countplot(data=MTeams, y='FirstD1Season');\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T09:27:02.361211Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T09:27:02.361741Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T09:27:02.682431Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T09:27:02.361705Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T09:27:02.68153Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# MSeasons\nThis file identifies the different seasons included in the historical data, along with certain season-level properties.\n\n* **Season** - indicates the year in which the tournament was played. Remember that the current season counts as 2022.\n* **DayZero** - tells you the date corresponding to DayNum=0 during that season. All game dates have been aligned upon a common scale so that (each year) the Monday championship game of the men's tournament is on DayNum=154. Working backward, the national semifinals are always on DayNum=152, the \"play-in\" games are on days 135, Selection Sunday is on day 132, the final day of the regular season is also day 132, and so on. All game data includes the day number in order to make it easier to perform date calculations. If you need to know the exact date a game was played on, you can combine the game's \"DayNum\" with the season's \"DayZero\". For instance, since day zero during the 2011-2012 season was 10/31/2011, if we know that the earliest regular season games that year were played on DayNum=7, they were therefore played on 11/07/2011.\n* **RegionW, RegionX, Region Y, Region Z** - by our contests' convention, each of the four regions in the final tournament is assigned a letter of W, X, Y, or Z. Whichever region's name comes first alphabetically, that region will be Region W. And whichever Region plays against Region W in the national semifinals, that will be Region X. For the other two regions, whichever region's name comes first alphabetically, that region will be Region Y, and the other will be Region Z. This allows us to identify the regions and brackets in a standardized way in other files, even if the region names change from year to year. For instance, during the 2012 tournament, the four regions were East, Midwest, South, and West. Being the first alphabetically, East becomes W. Since the East regional champion (Ohio State) played against the Midwest regional champion (Kansas) in the national semifinals, that makes Midwest be region X. For the other two (South and West), since South comes first alphabetically, that makes South Y and therefore West is Z. So for that season, the W/X/Y/Z are East,Midwest,South,West. And so for instance, Ohio State, the #2 seed in the East, is listed in the MNCAATourneySeeds file that year with a seed of W02, meaning they were the #2 seed in the W region (the East region). We will not know the final W/X/Y/Z designations until Selection Sunday, because the national semifinal pairings in the Final Four will depend upon the overall ranks of the four #1 seeds.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"MSeasons.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T09:30:45.238192Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T09:30:45.238506Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T09:30:45.251361Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T09:30:45.238471Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T09:30:45.250559Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print('Total Seasons: {}'.format(MSeasons.Season.nunique()))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T09:31:07.037392Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T09:31:07.037672Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T09:31:07.043949Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T09:31:07.037641Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T09:31:07.043138Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\nsns.countplot(data=MSeasons, x='RegionW');\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T09:31:16.939683Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T09:31:16.940262Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T09:31:17.068143Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T09:31:16.940225Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T09:31:17.06759Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\nsns.countplot(data=MSeasons, x='RegionX');\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T09:31:41.638285Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T09:31:41.63898Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T09:31:41.791963Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T09:31:41.638939Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T09:31:41.79114Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\nsns.countplot(data=MSeasons, x='RegionY');\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T09:31:53.274524Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T09:31:53.275339Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T09:31:53.43539Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T09:31:53.275299Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T09:31:53.434758Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\nsns.countplot(data=MSeasons, x='RegionZ');\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T09:32:04.193089Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T09:32:04.193903Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T09:32:04.345768Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T09:32:04.193862Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T09:32:04.345014Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"MSeasons[\"Day_of_year\"] = pd.to_datetime(MSeasons[\"DayZero\"]).apply(lambda x: x.day_of_year)\nfig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 5))\nsns.lineplot(x=MSeasons.Season, y=MSeasons.Day_of_year);\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T09:32:32.703293Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T09:32:32.704185Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T09:32:32.924791Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T09:32:32.704136Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T09:32:32.92385Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n<h1 align='center'> <b>Work in Progress!</b> </h1>\n</div>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1 align=\"center\" style=\"background-color:yellow;\" style=\"font-family:verdana;\"> ⬆️⬆️⬆️ If you find this note book helpful. <b>please upvote!</b> ⬆️⬆️⬆️ </h1>","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-22T07:23:06.059245Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-22T07:23:06.059603Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-22T07:23:06.067713Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-22T07:23:06.05957Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-22T07:23:06.066228Z"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}

Its objective is to be a reliable data set for data scientists to experiment new algorithms for video classification. The YouTube-8M data set is to videos what the ImageNet data set is to images.\n\nThe goal of this kernel is to show how \nSo, let's start by clarifying some points:\n\n - The YouTube-8M data set is enormous, containing more than 8 million videos previously labeled (more than one label per video is possible).\n - It would be impossible for us, mere mortals, to analyze all the frames from all the videos, so the research team at Google made it easy for us by using pre-trained neural networks (NNs) to extract relevant features from the videos.\n - Only the first 6 minutes of each video were analyzed by these NNs, one frame per second (so 360 frames per video). And as a result, from each frame, **1024 video features** and **128 audio features** were extracted. These are the **frame-level features**.\n - As a simplified alternative, these frame-level features are averaged (also centered and decorrelated) for all the analyzed frames in a video and the result is the **video-level features**.","execution_count":null,"cell_type":"markdown","outputs":[],"execution_state":"idle"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7daf23c9-bd85-b0df-448b-ea72c2785069","_active":false,"collapsed":false},"source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nfrom subprocess import check_output\nprint(check_output([\"ls\", \"../input\"]).decode(\"utf8\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"execution_state":"idle"}]}

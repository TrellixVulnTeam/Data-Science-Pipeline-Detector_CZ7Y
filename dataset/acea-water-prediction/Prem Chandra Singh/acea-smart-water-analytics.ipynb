As it is easy to imagine, a water supply company struggles with the need to forecast the water level in a waterbody (water spring, lake, river, or aquifer) to handle daily consumption. During fall and winter waterbodies are refilled, but during spring and summer they start to drain. To help preserve the health of these waterbodies it is important to predict the most efficient water availability, in terms of level and water flow for each day of the year.\n\nThis data contains total four different types of water bodies `water_spring`, `lake`, `river`, and `aquifer`. We will analyze all of them one by one.\n\n- *Spring water* are the `aquifer` water that flows out from the Earth's surface.\n\n- *Aquifer* is an underground layer of water-bearing permeable rock, rock fractures or unconsolidated materials (gravel, sand, or silt). It can be extracted using a water well.\n\n- *Lake* is an area filled with water, localized in a basin, surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake. Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, although like the much larger oceans, they form part of earth's water cycle.\n\n- *River* "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load the data\nauser = pd.read_csv('../input/acea-water-prediction/Aquifer_Auser.csv')\ndoganella = pd.read_csv('../input/acea-water-prediction/Aquifer_Doganella.csv')\nluco = pd.read_csv('../input/acea-water-prediction/Aquifer_Luco.csv')\npetrignano = pd.read_csv('../input/acea-water-prediction/Aquifer_Petrignano.csv')\nbilancino = pd.read_csv('../input/acea-water-prediction/Lake_Bilancino.csv')\narno = pd.read_csv('../input/acea-water-prediction/River_Arno.csv')\namiata = pd.read_csv('../input/acea-water-prediction/Water_Spring_Amiata.csv')\nlupa = pd.read_csv('../input/acea-water-prediction/Water_Spring_Lupa.csv')\nmadonna = pd.read_csv('../input/acea-water-prediction/Water_Spring_Madonna_di_Canneto.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Evaluation criteria\n\nThis is an Analytics competition where your task is to create a Notebook that best addresses the Evaluation criteria below.

For example between rainfall and amount/level of water.\n- Was there discussion of automated insight generation, demonstrating what factors to take into account?\n- Is the code documented in a way that makes it easy to understand and reproduce?\n- Were all external sources of data made public and cited appropriately?\n\nApplication (min 0 points, max 5 points)\n\n- Is the provided model useful/able to forecast water availability in terms of level or water flow in a time interval of the year?\n- Is the provided methodology applicable also on new datasets belong to another waterbody?"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Model\nCan you build a story to predict the amount of water in each unique waterbody?

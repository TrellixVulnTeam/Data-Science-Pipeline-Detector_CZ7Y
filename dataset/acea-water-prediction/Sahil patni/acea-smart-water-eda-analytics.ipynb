Listed on the Italian Stock Exchange since 1999, the company manages and develops water and electricity networks and environmental services. Acea is the foremost Italian operator in the water services sector supplying 9 million inhabitants in Lazio, Tuscany, Umbria, Molise, Campania.\n> - In this competition we will focus only on the water sector to help Acea Group preserve precious waterbodies. As it is easy to imagine, a water supply company struggles with the need to forecast the water level in a waterbody (water spring, lake, river, or aquifer) to handle daily consumption. During fall and winter waterbodies are refilled, but during spring and summer they start to drain. To help preserve the health of these waterbodies it is important to predict the most efficient water availability, in terms of level and water flow for each day of the year.\n\n#  Data\n> - The reality is that each waterbody has such unique characteristics that their attributes are not linked to each other. This analytics competition uses datasets that are completely independent from each other. However, it is critical to understand total availability in order to preserve water across the country.\n\n> - Each dataset represents a different kind of waterbody. As each waterbody is different from the other, the related features are also different. So, if for instance we consider a water spring we notice that its features are different from those of a lake. These variances are expected based upon the unique behavior and characteristics of each waterbody. The Acea Group deals with four different type of waterbodies: water springs, lakes, rivers and aquifers."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"os.listdir('../input/acea-water-prediction')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"Aquifer_Doganella = pd.read_csv('../input/acea-water-prediction/Aquifer_Doganella.csv', index_col = 'Date')\nAquifer_Auser = pd.read_csv('../input/acea-water-prediction/Aquifer_Auser.csv', index_col = 'Date')\nWater_Spring_Amiata = pd.read_csv('../input/acea-water-prediction/Water_Spring_Amiata.csv', index_col = 'Date')\nLake_Bilancino = pd.read_csv('../input/acea-water-prediction/Lake_Bilancino.csv', index_col = 'Date')\nWater_Spring_Madonna_di_Canneto = pd.read_csv('../input/acea-water-prediction/Water_Spring_Madonna_di_Canneto.csv', index_col = 'Date')\nAquifer_Luco = pd.read_csv('../input/acea-water-prediction/Aquifer_Luco.csv', index_col = 'Date')\nAquifer_Petrignano = pd.read_csv('../input/acea-water-prediction/Aquifer_Petrignano.csv', index_col = 'Date')\nWater_Spring_Lupa = pd.read_csv('../input/acea-water-prediction/Water_Spring_Lupa.csv', index_col = 'Date')\nRiver_Arno = pd.read_csv('../input/acea-water-prediction/River_Arno.csv', index_col = 'Date')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"datasets = [Aquifer_Doganella, Aquifer_Auser, Water_Spring_Amiata,\n            Lake_Bilancino, Water_Spring_Madonna_di_Canneto, Aquifer_Luco,\n            Aquifer_Petrignano, Water_Spring_Lupa, River_Arno]\n\ndatasets_names = ['Aquifer_Doganella', 'Aquifer_Auser', 'Water_Spring_Amiata',\n                'Lake_Bilancino', 'Water_Spring_Madonna_di_Canneto', 'Aquifer_Luco',\n                'Aquifer_Petrignano', 'Water_Spring_Lupa', 'River_Arno']\n\nprint('Datasets Shapes:')\nprint('='*30)\nfor i in range(len(datasets)):\n    print('{}: {}'.format(datasets_names[i], datasets[i].shape))\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print('Datasets Info:')\nprint('='*30)\nfor i in range(len(datasets)):\n    print('{}: {}'.format(datasets_names[i], datasets[i].info()))\n    print('-'*60)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":" # - Aquifer_Doganella Dataset"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"Aquifer_Doganella.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

We need to divide the series into bins for ML to work better on them.\n \nThere are different kind of series. We will try to categorize them into groups. Lets start with simple classification: oscillating (OS) or non oscillating (NOS). Other way to classify is to check if it is increasing (I), decreasing (D), or range bound (RB).\n\nWe can further classify the a series as arthematic series (AS) or exponential series (ES). We can trian a different machine learning algorithm for each type of series and hopefully be more successful.\n\nLet us read the data and examine it."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":false},"outputs":[],"source":"# Importing libraries\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# read train data\ndata = pd.read_csv(\"../input/train.csv\")\n\n# Convert sequence into list of integer lists (convenient for accessing)\nseqs = data['Sequence'].tolist()\nseqsL = [list(map(int, x.split(\",\"))) for x in seqs]"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"Let us see how the first series looks:"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":false},"outputs":[],"source":"series = seqsL[0]\nprint(series)"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"The first series is clearly an exponential series (ES), non oscillating (NOS) and increasing (I).

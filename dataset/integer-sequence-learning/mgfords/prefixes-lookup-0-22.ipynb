This sequence is cubes: $ f(n)=n^3 $.\n\nAn array of differences is `[ 8 - 1, 27 - 8, 64 - 27, 125 - 64, 216 - 125 ] = [ 7, 19, 37, 61, 91 ]`. A simple quick look at this sequence doesn't let us recognize it. We'll define it as $ f_1( n ) = f_0( n + 1 ) - f_0( n ) $ where $ f_0( n ) = f( n ) $ is the original sequence. If we calculate differences once again, we get: `[ 19 - 7, 37 - 19, 61 - 37, 91 - 61 ] = [ 12, 18, 24, 30 ]`. And this pattern is already recognizable. Let's take one more: `[ 18 - 12, 24 - 18, 30 - 24 ] = [ 6, 6, 6 ]`. A constant value of `6`. How to get a next element? We need to add one more constant `6` to the array of third differences. Then the next element of second differences $ f_2( n ) = f_2( n - 1 ) + f_3( n - 1 ) $. So, $ f_2( 5 ) = f_2( 4 ) + f_3( 4 ) = 30 + 6 = 36 $. Analogously, $ f_1( 6 ) = f_1( 5 ) + f_2( 5 ) = 91 + 36 = 127 $. Finally, $ f_0( 7 ) = f_0( 6 ) + f_1( 6 ) = 216 + 127 = 343 $. Check: $ f( 7 ) = 7^3 = 343 = f_0( 7 ) $ â€“ correct.\n\nAnother example: `[ 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 ]`. Differences: `[ 2 - 1, 4 - 2, 8 - 4, 16 - 8, 32 - 16, 64 - 32 ] = [ 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32 ]`. The result is the original sequence itself. We can take the next element from the first array: `64`. Then the next element of original sequence is $ f_0( 8 ) = f_0( 7 ) + f_1( 7 ) = 64 + 64 = 128 $.\n\nIn many cases a next item of sequence can be predicted by calculating a next item of differences array. And if that array is recognizable then we are able to easily find the next item. It's possible to recognize an array by looking it up in a prefix tree (trie).\n\nThat trie would contain not sequences themselves but their signatures. We'll use a definition of signature function suggested by [Nina Chen](https://www.kaggle.com/ncchen) in [this article](https://www.kaggle.com/ncchen/integer-sequence-learning/match-test-set-to-training-set) with a slight change: $$ signature( seq ) = sign( seq ) \\star \\frac{ seq }{ GCD( seq ) } $$.\n\nHere, `sign` is a sign of the first non-zero item of sequence `seq` (+1 if the item is positive, or -1 otherwise) and `GCD` is a greatest common divisor of all sequence elements.\n\nExample: sequence `[ 2, 4, 6, 8 ]` would be stored in a trie as `[ 1, 2, 3, 4 ]` because `GCD( [ 2, 4, 6, 8 ] ) = 2` and we divide each element of sequence by GCD.\n\n__A GCD function definition (taken from Nina Chen's article):__"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"5ecd9a21-6671-40e1-9455-075d3d0cf7a2"},"outputs":[],"source":"import math\n\ndef findGCD(seq):\n    gcd = seq[0]\n    for i in range(1,len(seq)):\n        gcd=math.gcd(gcd, seq[i])\n    return gcd\n\nprint(findGCD([2,4,6,8]))"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"fa8101a7-a4d9-4f81-9379-c22c5037e8f5"},"source":"__Signature function (slightly modified version of Nina Chen's function):__"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7d0a63c0-e458-4a47-8d41-acb3af286f4e"},"outputs":[],"source":"def findSignature(seq):\n    nonzero_seq = [d for d in seq if d!=0]\n    if len(nonzero_seq)==0:\n        return seq\n    sign = 1 if nonzero_seq[0]>0 else -1\n    gcd = findGCD(seq)\n    return [sign*x//gcd for x in seq]\n\nprint(findSignature([0,2,4,6,8]))"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"4d58e368-cfe4-40e6-986e-430c5d48f9ce"},"source":"__A function to find differences array:__"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"91a36a1d-aa68-4266-b945-6c8cbd514e25"},"outputs":[],"source":"def findDerivative(seq):\n    return [0] if len(seq)<=1 else [seq[i]-seq[i-1] for i in range(1,len(seq))]\n\nprint(findDerivative([1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21]))"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"95ad5b05-2a48-47a6-80e9-2b0c52f0a627"},"source":"__Trie class implementation:__"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"395802db-abea-4330-8141-8b5041a50e52"},"outputs":[],"source":"def addAll(seq, node, list):\n    if 'value' in node:\n        list.append( ( seq, node['value'] ) )\n    for key in node:\n        if key != 'value':\n            addAll(seq + [key], node[key], list)\n\nclass prefixTree:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.data={}\n        self.puts=0\n        self.nodes=0\n    \n    def put(self, seq, value):\n        node=self.data\n        nodeCreated=False\n        for i in range(0,len(seq)):\n            item=seq[i]\n            if not item in node:\n                node[item]={}\n                if 'value' in node:\n                    del node['value']\n                self.nodes+=1\n                nodeCreated=True\n            node=node[item]\n        if nodeCreated:\n            node['value']=value\n            self.puts+=1\n        elif 'value' in node:\n            node['value']=max(node['value'], value)\n    \n    def prefix(self, seq):\n        list=[]\n        node=self.data\n        for i in range(0,len(seq)):\n            item=seq[i]\n            if item in node:\n                node=node[item]\n            else:\n                return list\n        addAll(seq, node, list)\n        return list\n    \n    def hasPrefix(self, seq):\n        node=self.data\n        for i in range(0,len(seq)):\n            item=seq[i]\n            if item in node:\n                node=node[item]\n            else:\n                return False\n        return True\n\nsampleTrie=prefixTree()\nsampleTrie.put([1,2,3], 50)\nsampleTrie.put([1,2,4,9], 30)\nsampleTrie.put([2,3,4], 20)\nprint(sampleTrie.prefix([1,2]))"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"278ef05b-0787-409f-8d6f-622226d83dcc"},"source":"Note that this is a showcase implementation.

Machine learning methods are *not* used here. \n    \n   Among the 113,849 sequenes in the test set, we found more than 5000 of them satify recurrence relations of order 2,3 or 4. For those sequences, we computed the recurrence relations and predict the next terms. Moreover, we found recurrence relations that are not described in the OEIS. \n\n## Linear Recurrence Relations ##\n\n(Remark: This notebook only considers homogeneous linear recurrence relations with constant coefficients. Nonlinear or non-homogeneous relations are not investigated here.)\n\n### 2nd order recurrence relation ###   \nA second order recurrence relation is of the form:  $$ a_{n+2} = c_{0}a_{n}+ c_{1}a_{n+1}, $$\nwhere the coefficients $c_{0}$ and $c_{1}$ are constant.\n\nFor example, the Fibonacci sequence $a_{n+2}= a_{n}+a_{n+1}$ is a second order recurrence sequence with coefficients $(1,1)$.\n\n### 3rd order recurrence relation ###   \nA second order recurrence relation is of the form:  $$ a_{n+3} = c_{0}a_{n}+ c_{1}a_{n+1}+c_{2}a_{n+2}, $$\nwhere the coefficients $c_{0},c_{1},c_{2}$ are constant.\n\n\n## Detect Recurrence Relations ##\n\nGiven a sequence $a_{n}$, let's say we want to verify whether it's given by a 3rd order recurrence relation. In other words, we check if it's possible to find constants $c_{0},c_{1},c_{2}$ so that $$a_{n+3} = c_{0}a_{n}+ c_{1}a_{n+1}+c_{2}a_{n+2}$$ is satified. To find possible $c_{0},c_{1},c_{2}$, since there are 3 unknowns, we need at least 3 equations. Let's set the equations using $a_{3},a_{4},a_{5}$ as follows:\n\n$$ a_{3} = c_{0}a_{0}+ c_{1}a_{1}+c_{2}a_{2} $$\n$$ a_{4} = c_{0}a_{1}+ c_{1}a_{2}+c_{2}a_{3} $$\n$$ a_{5} = c_{0}a_{2}+ c_{1}a_{3}+c_{2}a_{4}. $$\n\nWritting these equations in matrix form, we obtain\n\n$$\\begin{bmatrix}\na_{0} & a_{1} & a_{2} \\\\ \na_{1} & a_{2} & a_{3} \\\\\na_{2} & a_{3} & a_{4}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nc_{0} \\\\ \nc_{1}\\\\\nc_{2}\n\\end{bmatrix}=\n\\begin{bmatrix}\na_{3} \\\\ \na_{4}\\\\\na_{5}\n\\end{bmatrix},\n$$ \nthen we solve for $(c_{0},c_{1},c_{2})$. Once the coefficients $(c_{0},c_{1},c_{2})$ are found, we check whether the next terms $a_{6},a_{7},\\cdots$ satisfy the recurrence relation.\n"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":false},"outputs":[],"source":""},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":false},"outputs":[],"source":""},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":false},"outputs":[],"source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\ntestfile='../input/test.csv'\ndata = open(testfile).readlines()\n\nsequences={}   #(key, value) = (id , sequence)\nfor i in range(1,len(data)): \n    line=data[i]\n    line =line.replace('\"','')\n    line = line[:-1].split(',')\n    id = int(line[0])\n    sequence=[int(x) for x in line[1:]];\n    sequences[id]=sequence"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":false},"outputs":[],"source":"def checkRecurrence(seq, order= 2, minlength = 7):\n    \"\"\"\n    :type seq: List[int]\n    :type order: int\n    :type minlength: int \n    :rtype: List[int]\n    \n    Check whether the input sequence is a recurrence sequence with given order.\n    If it is, return the coefficients for the recurrenec relation.\n    If not, return None.\n    \"\"\"     \n    if len(seq)< max((2*order+1), minlength):\n        return None\n    \n    ################ Set up the system of equations \n    A,b = [], []\n    for i in range(order):\n        A.append(seq[i:i+order])\n        b.append(seq[i+order])\n    A,b =np.array(A), np.array(b)\n    try: \n        if np.linalg.det(A)==0:\n            return None\n    except TypeError:\n        return None\n   \n    #############  Solve for the coefficients (c0, c1, c2, ...)\n    coeffs = np.linalg.inv(A).dot(b)  \n    \n    ############  Check if the next terms satisfy recurrence relation\n    for i in range(2*order, len(seq)):\n        predict = np.sum(coeffs*np.array(seq[i-order:i]))\n        if abs(predict-seq[i])>10**(-2):\n            return None\n    \n    return list(coeffs)\n\n\ndef predictNextTerm(seq, coeffs):\n    \"\"\"\n    :type seq: List[int]\n    :type coeffs: List[int]\n    :rtype: int\n    \n    Given a sequence and coefficienes, compute the next term for the sequence.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    order = len(coeffs)\n    predict = np.sum(coeffs*np.array(seq[-order:]))\n    return int(round(predict))\n"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"## Example: ##\n* Given a sequence [1,5,11,21,39,73,139,269,527].\n* We verify if it's 3rd order recurrence sequence and find the coefficients (2,-5,4).\n* We then predict the next term using the last 3 terms and the relation $a_{n+3} = 2a_{n}-5a_{n+1}+4a_{n+2}$.

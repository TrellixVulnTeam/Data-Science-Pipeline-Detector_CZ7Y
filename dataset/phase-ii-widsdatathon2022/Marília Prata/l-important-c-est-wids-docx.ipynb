Climate change is a globally relevant, urgent, and multi-faceted issue heavily impacted by energy policy and infrastructure. Addressing climate change involves mitigation (i.e. mitigating greenhouse gas emissions) and adaptation (i.e. preparing for unavoidable consequences). Mitigation of GHG emissions requires changes to electricity systems, transportation, buildings, industry, and land use.\"\n\nhttps://www.widsconference.org/blog_archive/the-women-in-data-science-wids-datathon-2022-is-now-live-on-kaggle","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import docx","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-26T18:57:13.758583Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-26T18:57:13.75884Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-26T18:57:13.866Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-26T18:57:13.758806Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-26T18:57:13.865218Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"path_of_file = '../input/phase-ii-widsdatathon2022/critical_health/critical_health/data_links.txt'\ntext = open(path_of_file, 'r').read()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-26T19:34:34.639336Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-26T19:34:34.639667Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-26T19:34:34.659993Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-26T19:34:34.639586Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-26T19:34:34.659006Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\"The WiDS Datathon dataset was created in collaboration with Climate Change AI (CCAI) and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab).\n\n\"WiDS Datathon participants will analyze differences in building energy efficiency, creating models to predict building energy consumption, an important first step in understanding how to maximize energy efficiency.\n\n\"Participants will use a dataset consisting of variables that describe building characteristics and climate and weather variables for the regions in which the buildings are located.

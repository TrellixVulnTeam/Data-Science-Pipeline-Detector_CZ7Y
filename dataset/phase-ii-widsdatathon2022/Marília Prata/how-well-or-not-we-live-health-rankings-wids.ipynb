The Rankings use more than 30 measures that help communities understand how healthy their residents are today (health outcomes) and what will impact their health in the future (health factors).\"\n\n\"The County Health Rankings are compiled from many different types of data. To calculate the ranks, each of the measures was first standardized using a z-score. The ranks are then calculated based on weighted sums of the standardized measures within each state. The county with the lowest z-score (best health) gets a rank of number1 for that state and the county with the highest score (worst health) is assigned a rank corresponding to the number of places we rank in that state.\"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQE41F7PAPHi_g7HGIBZ7K2B1DRGlZnjNyl6Q&usqp=CAU)wndu.com","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/cusersmarildownloadsrankmdcsv/rankmd.csv\", delimiter=';', encoding='ISO-8859-2')\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)\ndf.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-04T20:59:49.066878Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-04T20:59:49.067172Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-04T20:59:49.532339Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-04T20:59:49.067138Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-04T20:59:49.531324Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Ci Low and Ci High\n\n\"In frequentist statistics, a confidence interval (CI) is a range of estimates for an unknown parameter, defined as an interval with a lower bound and an upper bound (notwithstanding one-sided confidence intervals, which are bounded only on one side).

CDC Death Dataset\n\nDescription prepared by Adrien Carrel, MSc student in Engineering Sciences at CentraleSupelec, Paris, France & Marie Charpignon, PhD candidate in Statistics at MIT IDSS\n\n\"The CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) death dataset contains provisional death data compiled by the U.S. National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS). The provisional counts for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) deaths are based on a current flow of mortality data in the National Vital Statistics System (NVSS). \n\n\"This dataset is continuously updated in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The underlying data emanates from death certificates filed at the state and local level. Variables captured in the dataset include counts of COVID-19-related deaths stratified by age, gender, race, ethnicity, as well as place of death. Additionally, the dataset includes information about comorbidities that have contributed to each death.\"\n\nC. CDC/ATSDR Social Vulnerability Index (SVI)\n\nDescription prepared by Mingying Yang, Computer Science student at MIT\n\n\"The CDC/ATSDR SVI is a database that uses US Census data to determine the social vulnerability of every census tract. Social Vulnerability refers to the resilience of communities (the ability to survive and thrive) when confronted by external stresses on human health, stresses such as natural or human-caused disasters, or disease outbreaks.\"\n\n\"Census tracts are subdivisions of counties for which the Census collects statistical data. The CDC/ATSDR SVI ranks each tract on 15 social factors, including poverty, lack of vehicle access, and crowded housing, and groups them into four related themes. Tract rankings are based on percentiles. Percentile ranking values range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating greater vulnerability.\"\n\n\"SVI 2014 and 2016 are also available via ArcGIS Online. Search on “CDC’s Social \nVulnerability Index”.

This is partly due to ageism, or the discrimination of older adults based on age, which has been prevalent in research, policy, and the media.\n\nTraditional media (such as newspapers, television, and radio) have long reinforced ageist stereotypes by often portraying older adults as a burden to society.\n\nDuring the pandemic, this phenomenon has also been observed in social media (online platforms for sharing user-generated content). COVID-19 has accelerated changes in the way we share information, with a shift towards social media use by governments, news outlets, and researchers.\n\nWhile this has speeded up the transmission of data, it has also led to the dissemination of misinformation and negative messages.\n\nNegative social media messages about COVID-19 and aging often characterize older adults as helpless and expendable individuals.\n\n“#BoomerRemover” Twitter hashtag: Hate speech and Intergenerational Resentment.\n\nExisting hate speech and intergenerational resentment can be exemplified by the “#BoomerRemover” Twitter hashtag (user-generated metadata term), which was widely shared in social mediaat the beginning of the pandemic.\n\nTo understand the dissemination of ageist messages in social media, the authors group conducted a qualitative analysis of the content English-language tweets about COVID-19 and older adults posted in the ten days following the pandemic declaration .\n\nTheir findings showed that almost a quarter of tweets downplayed the importance of COVID-19 because it was deadlier among older individuals, and that 14% contained offensive content or jokes. Sentiment analysis found that negative tweets mostly contained words related with death and/or sickness, and that sentiments changed over time, with an increase in negative content right after the pandemic declaration and a decrease thereafter.\n\nOlder Individuals Engagement: a Way to Receive Support during the Pandemic.\n\nThere is a need to promote inclusivity in social media and to make the voices of older adults heard. Increasing the participation of older individuals can boost their engagement in social interactions and represent a way to provide and receive social support during the pandemic.\n\nhttps://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(20)30378-3/fulltext","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install squarify","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-30T23:30:37.08987Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-30T23:30:37.090189Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-30T23:30:48.42622Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-30T23:30:37.090158Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-30T23:30:48.425092Z"},"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df2['solution'] = 'Solution'\nsolution = df2.truncate(before = -1, after = 15)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-30T23:31:08.765709Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-30T23:31:08.766049Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-30T23:31:08.773702Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-30T23:31:08.766011Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-30T23:31:08.772729Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Code by Roshan Sharma https://www.kaggle.com/roshansharma/market-basket-analysis\n\nimport networkx as nx\n\nsolution = nx.from_pandas_edgelist(solution, source = 'solution', target = \"Addressed Population\", edge_attr = True)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-30T23:31:13.599316Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-30T23:31:13.599618Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-30T23:31:13.606949Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-30T23:31:13.599584Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-30T23:31:13.606031Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Code by Roshan Sharma https://www.kaggle.com/roshansharma/market-basket-analysis\n\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (20, 20)\npos = nx.spring_layout(solution)\ncolor = plt.cm.Wistia(np.linspace(0, 15, 1))\nnx.draw_networkx_nodes(solution, pos, node_size = 15000, node_color = color)\nnx.draw_networkx_edges(solution, pos, width = 3, alpha = 0.6, edge_color = 'black')\nnx.draw_networkx_labels(solution, pos, font_size = 20, font_family = 'sans-serif')\nplt.axis('off')\nplt.grid()\nplt.title('Addressed Population', fontsize = 40)\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-30T23:32:02.238805Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-30T23:32:02.239098Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-30T23:32:02.622945Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-30T23:32:02.239068Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-30T23:32:02.622008Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df2['challenge'] = 'Challenge'\nchallenge = df2.truncate(before = -1, after = 15)\nchallenge = nx.from_pandas_edgelist(challenge, source = 'challenge', target = \"Study\", edge_attr = True)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-30T23:33:52.038996Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-30T23:33:52.039528Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-30T23:33:52.048222Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-30T23:33:52.039485Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-30T23:33:52.047333Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (20, 20)\npos = nx.spring_layout(challenge)\ncolor = plt.cm.Blues(np.linspace(0, 15, 1))\nnx.draw_networkx_nodes(challenge, pos, node_size = 15000, node_color = color)\nnx.draw_networkx_edges(challenge, pos, width = 3, alpha = 0.6, edge_color = 'brown')\nnx.draw_networkx_labels(challenge, pos, font_size = 20, font_family = 'sans-serif')\nplt.axis('off')\nplt.grid()\nplt.title('Vulnerable Populations Studies', fontsize = 40)\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-03-30T23:33:57.9266Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-03-30T23:33:57.92693Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-03-30T23:33:58.416571Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-03-30T23:33:57.92689Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-03-30T23:33:58.41541Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1><span class=\"label label-default\" style=\"background-color:purple;border-radius:100px 100px; font-weight: bold; font-family:Garamond; font-size:20px; color:white; padding:10px\"> Apoyos para salud ante Covid-19</span></h1><br>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"COVID-19 and opportunities for international cooperation in health\n\n\"The pandemic has proven to be a problem that can profoundly impact the global economy: trillions of dollars have evaporated from the world's stock exchanges.\"\n\n\"Governments had to open their coffers and spend on health services, financial aid companies and workers .

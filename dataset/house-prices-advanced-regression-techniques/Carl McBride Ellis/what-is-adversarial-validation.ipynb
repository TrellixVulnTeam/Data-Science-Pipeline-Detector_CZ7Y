However, for the best results it is essential that the training data is a representative sample of the data we intend to use it on (*i.e.* the test data), otherwise our model will, at best, under-perform, or at worst, be completely useless.   \n\n***Adversarial Validation*** is a very clever and very simple way to let us know if our test data and our training data are similar; we combine our `train` and `test` data, labeling them with say a `0` for the training data and a `1` for the test data, mix them up, then see if we are able to correctly re-identify them using a binary classifier.\n\nIf we cannot correctly classify them, *i.e.* we obtain an area under the [receiver operating characteristic curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic) (ROC) of 0.5 then they are indistinguishable and we are good to go.\n\nHowever, if we can classify them (ROC > 0.5) then we have a problem, either with the whole dataset or more likely with some features in particular, which are probably from  different distributions in the test and train datasets.\nIf we have a problem, we can look at the feature that was most out of place. The problem may be that there were values that were only seen in, say, training data, but not in the test data. If the contribution to the ROC is very high from one feature, it may well be a good idea to remove that feature from the model.\n\n\n## Adversarial Validation to reduce overfitting\nThe key to avoid overfitting is to create a situation where the local cross-vlidation (CV) score is representative of the competition score. When we have a ROC of 0.5 then your local data is representative of the test data, thus your local CV score should now be representative of the Public LB score.\n\nProcedure:\n\n* drop the training data target column \n* label the `test` and `train` data with `0` and `1` (it doesn't really matter which is which)\n* combine the training and test data into one big dataset\n* perform the binary classification, for example using XGboost\n* look at our AUC ROC score\n\nWe shall look at two examples of adversarial validation. Note: For the purposes of these demonstrations we shall only be using the numeric features.\n# Titanic\nFor our first example we shall look at the [Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) dataset","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport xgboost as xgb\nfrom xgboost import XGBClassifier\nfrom xgboost import plot_importance\nfrom xgboost import cv\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nplt.rcParams.update({'font.size': 12})","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-09T11:03:17.742275Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-09T11:03:17.742977Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-09T11:03:18.766455Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-09T11:03:17.742881Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-09T11:03:18.765351Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# read in the data\ntrain = pd.read_csv(\"../input/titanic/train.csv\")\ntest  = pd.read_csv(\"../input/titanic/test.csv\")\n\n# select only the numerical features\nX_test  = test.select_dtypes(include=['number']).copy()\nX_train = train.select_dtypes(include=['number']).copy()\n\n# drop the target column from the training data\nX_train = X_train.drop(['Survived'], axis=1)\n\n# add the train/test labels\nX_train[\"AV_label\"] = 0\nX_test[\"AV_label\"]  = 1\n\n# make one big dataset\nall_data = pd.concat([X_train, X_test], axis=0, ignore_index=True)\n\n# shuffle\nall_data_shuffled = all_data.sample(frac=1)\n\n# create our DMatrix (the XGBoost data structure)\nX = all_data_shuffled.drop(['AV_label'], axis=1)\ny = all_data_shuffled['AV_label']\nXGBdata = xgb.DMatrix(data=X,label=y)\n\n# our XGBoost parameters\nparams = {\"objective\":\"binary:logistic\",\n          \"eval_metric\":\"logloss\",\n          'learning_rate': 0.05,\n          'max_depth': 5, }\n\n# perform cross validation with XGBoost\ncross_val_results = cv(dtrain=XGBdata, params=params, \n                       nfold=5, metrics=\"auc\", \n                       num_boost_round=200,early_stopping_rounds=20,\n                       as_pandas=True)\n\n# print out the final result\nprint((cross_val_results[\"test-auc-mean\"]).tail(1))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-09T11:03:18.767759Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-09T11:03:18.768032Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-09T11:03:18.911901Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-09T11:03:18.768004Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-09T11:03:18.91112Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We can see an AUC of 1 which indicates that our classifier is able to perfectly distinguish between the original training and test data.

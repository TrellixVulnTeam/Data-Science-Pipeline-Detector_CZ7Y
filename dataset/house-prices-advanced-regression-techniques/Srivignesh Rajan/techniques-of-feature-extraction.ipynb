T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (TSNE)\nTSNE is an algorithm that identifies the non-linear relationships in the data. It is a tool to visualize data.\n\nT-SNE differs from PCA by preserving only small pairwise distances or local similarities whereas PCA is concerned with preserving large pairwise distances to maximize variance.\n\n* First, t-SNE constructs a probability distribution over pairs of high-dimensional objects in such a way that similar objects are assigned a higher probability while dissimilar points are assigned a very low probability. \n* Second, t-SNE defines a similar probability distribution over the points in the low-dimensional map, and it minimizes the Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence (KL divergence) between the two distributions with respect to the locations of the points in the map. While the original algorithm uses the Euclidean distance between objects as the base of its similarity metric, this can be changed as appropriate.\n\nKL-Divergence is also called relative entropy which is a measure of how two distributions vary.\n\n**Reference:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def TSNE_FE(x_train, y_train, n):\n    \"\"\"T-SNE - Feature Extraction\"\"\"\n    tsne = TSNE(n_components = n)\n    column_list = []\n    for i in range(1,n+1):\n        column_list = column_list + ['component'+str(i)]\n    x_train_tsne = pd.DataFrame(tsne.fit_transform(x_train,y_train),columns = column_list,index=x_train.index)\n    return x_train_tsne, tsne\n\n'''TSNE with two dimensions'''\nx_train_tsne, tsne = TSNE_FE(x_train, y_train, 2)\ndisplay(x_train_tsne.head())\n\n'''TSNE with three dimensions'''\nx_train_tsne_3, tsne = TSNE_FE(x_train, y_train, 3)\ndisplay(x_train_tsne_3.head())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def plot_tsne(x_train_tsne):\n    '''2D data visualization for MDS'''\n    plt.figure(1, figsize=(10,10))\n    plt.title('Scatter Plot for TSNE',fontsize = 15)\n    plt.xlabel('Component1',fontsize =12)\n    plt.ylabel('Component2',fontsize =12)\n    plt_obj = plt.scatter(x_train_tsne['component1'], x_train_tsne['component2'])\n\nplot_mds(x_train_tsne)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"'''3D data visualization for TSNE'''\npx.scatter_3d( x_train_tsne_3, x='component1', y ='component2', z='component3')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

There are very less scenarios where this assumption holds true.

When the coefficient for A is calculated, will that coefficient be accurate? No, it won’t be right because changes in A are associated with shifts in B, and as we have already discussed that all the other variables need to be held constant, B can’t be held as a constant because A and B are correlated. This is known as Multicollinearity and it is one of the disadvantages of Linear Regression.\n\nIn order to solve this problem, we use various regularization techniques (l1, l2 etc) or other kind of regression techniuques like Elastic Net Regression, Lasso and Ridge Regression which automatically takes care of multicollinearity.\n\nCheck this [blog](https://medium.com/gdg-vit/overcoming-the-drawbacks-of-linear-regression-497fffcdd2d8) for better understanding"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plt.figure(figsize = ((15, 10)))\ndf.boxplot(by = 'OverallQual', column = 'SalePrice')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As the quality increases, price of the houses also increase"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Exploring Categorical Variables"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def horizontal_plot(data, column_name, color, plot_title):\n    \n    \"\"\"\n    A function that plots a horizontal bar graph for the given column name\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize = (9, 6))\n    \n    title_cnt = data[column_name].value_counts().sort_values(ascending = False).reset_index()\n\n    mn = ax.barh(title_cnt.iloc[:, 0], title_cnt.iloc[:, 1], edgecolor = 'black', color =\n                sns.color_palette(color, len(title_cnt)))\n\n    for s in ['top','bottom','left','right']:\n        ax.spines[s].set_visible(False)\n\n    # Remove x,y Ticks\n    ax.xaxis.set_ticks_position('none')\n    ax.yaxis.set_ticks_position('none')\n\n    # Add padding between axes and labels\n    ax.xaxis.set_tick_params(pad=5)\n    ax.yaxis.set_tick_params(pad=10)\n\n    # Add x,y gridlines\n    ax.grid(b=True, color='grey', linestyle='-.', linewidth=1, alpha=0.2)\n\n    # Show top values \n    ax.invert_yaxis()\n\n    ax.set_title(plot_title,weight='bold',loc='center', pad=10, fontsize=16)\n    \n    ax.set_xlabel('Count', weight='bold')\n\n    for i in ax.patches:\n        ax.text(i.get_width() + 1.0, i.get_y() + 0.5, str(round((i.get_width()), 2)),\n                fontsize=10, fontweight='bold', color='grey')\n\n    plt.yticks(weight='bold')\n    plt.xticks(weight='bold')\n\n    plt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"horizontal_plot(df, 'Neighborhood', 'Reds', 'Most frequent neighborhoods')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"horizontal_plot(df, 'BldgType', 'Greens', 'Building type: Type of dwelling')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"horizontal_plot(df, 'GarageCond', 'Blues', 'Garage Condition')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Most of the houses have Typically Average Garage Condition.

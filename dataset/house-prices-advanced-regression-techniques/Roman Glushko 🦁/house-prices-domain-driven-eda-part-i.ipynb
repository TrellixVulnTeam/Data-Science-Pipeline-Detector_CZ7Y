With warranty deeds, there are three ways on how sale price could be paid:\n    - **Conventinal mortgage** - is any type of home buyerâ€™s loan that is not offered or secured by a government entity. Instead, conventional mortgages are available through private lenders, such as banks, credit unions, and mortgage companies.\n    - **VA Loan** - is a mortgage loan in the United States guaranteed by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)\n    - **Cash**\n\n- A **land contract** can also be called a contract for deed or agreement for deed and works similarly to a note and mortgage. However, instead of the buyer gaining title to the property, the seller remains on title until the debt is repaid in full. Contacts could the following types:\n    - 15% down payment and regular intrest rate\n    - Low down payment and low intrest rate\n    - Low intrested rate/Low Down payment\n\n- **Court Officer Deed** - is used only by court appointed or supervised fiduciaries, such as executors, administrators, conservators, and trustees, and may have fewer warranties than the general warranty deed.\n- **Other types**\n\nThere is also \"**home just constructed and sold**\" sale type.

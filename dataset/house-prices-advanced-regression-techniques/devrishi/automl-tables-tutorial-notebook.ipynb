In this competition we try to use data about a house (square footage, location, etc) to predict it's Sale Price. \n\nUsing AutoML Tables, we see we're able to get an initial high performing solution without spending upfront time on feature engineering, model selection or hyperparameter tuning. We hope you get a chance to try this tool and leave us your feedback!"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Important Notes about AutoML\n\nBefore we get started using AutoML, there's a few important things to know. \n\n#### Firstly, please note that Google AutoML is a paid service and requires a GCP project with billing enabled to use. Prices vary by the specific AutoML product you'd like to use; in this tutorial we use AutoML tables, which at the time of publishing costs \\$19.32 per hour of compute during training and $1.16 per hour of compute for batch prediction with more details [here](https://cloud.google.com/automl-tables/pricing).\n\nFurthermore, keep in mind that AutoML is currently in [Beta](https://cloud.google.com/products/#product-launch-stages). While we're excited to integrate with an early exciting technology, you may run into some usability frictions or known issues. We welcome all feedback from the community, and user feedback will help us improve the documentation and be shared with the AutoML team to improve the product.\n\nLastly, AutoML tends to work better on **larger datasets** and when trained for **longer amounts of time**. In this particular example, we pick a very small dataset (few thousand rows) where we  train a reasonable AutoML model within one to two hours. So, we picked this particular reference because it is an easy & familiar one for our Kaggle community to see how to use AutoML even though the tool would usually perform better on larger and/or more intensive problems."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Step 0: Set up your Google Cloud Project\n\nBefore getting started with our AutoML Integration, you'll need to link a Google Account and create a GCP Project. You can see more details on how to do this in the official AutoML [docs](https://cloud.google.com/automl-tables/docs/quickstart). In particular, you'll want to:\n\n1. [Select or create a GCP Project](https://console.cloud.google.com/projectselector2/home/dashboard?_ga=2.199933678.-119742050.1571893794)\n2. [Enable Billing](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/modify-project). Remember to understand pricing prior to this step.\n3. [Enable Cloud AutoML and Storage APIs](https://console.cloud.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=storage-component.googleapis.com,automl.googleapis.com,storage-api.googleapis.com&redirect=https://console.cloud.google.com&_ga=2.32030718.-119742050.1571893794)\n\nOnce you have your account and project configured, simply attach it to this Kernel by selecting **Google Cloud Services** from the Add-ons menu in the Kernel editor and following the on-screen instructions to link your account. Make sure you've linked both AutoML and GCS for this tutorial. \n\nLuckily, you're eligible for a \\$300 credit when creating a new GCP project, and we'll be looking to distribute more credits throughout the year to make it easier to try --- stay tuned!"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Step 1: Read in and Prepare your Data\n\nAutoML reads data from internet enabled storage like Google Cloud Storage or BigQuery, so we need to move our Kaggle Dataset from our 'local' environment in our Kernel to a GCS bucket specifically configured for our use case. The next few code cells will walk through how to prepare the data once you've added the Housing Prices Competition Dataset to your Notebook. \n\nFirst read in the data into pandas dataframes, and do any cleaning & pre-processing you'd like to make your dataset easier to use. In this example, we make minimal changes to the data."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.\nsample_submission = pd.read_csv(\"../input/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/sample_submission.csv\")\ntest_df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/test.csv\")\ntrain_df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/train.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This dataset has some missing values, which we set to the median of the column for the purpose of this tutorial. \ncleaned_train_df = train_df.fillna(train_df.median())\ncleaned_test_df = test_df.fillna(test_df.median())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.\n# Write the dataframes back out to a csv file, which we can more easily upload to GCS. \ncleaned_train_df.to_csv(path_or_buf='train.csv', index=False)\ncleaned_test_df.to_csv(path_or_buf='test.csv', index=False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Step 2: Initialize the clients and move your data to GCS\n\nNow we want to take the csv files we prepared locally and upload them to a bucket in Google Cloud Storage that AutoML Tables can access. \n\nFirst, we'll create variables to store our GCS Project ID and come up with a new name for the GCS Bucket where this data will live.

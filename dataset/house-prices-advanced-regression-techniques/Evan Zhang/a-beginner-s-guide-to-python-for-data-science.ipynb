Each module will have a word explanation, some code examples, and a more information section which you can use to dig deeper into the nuances of Python. To provide beginners with the best experience, **I recommend forking this notebook** (you should be able to do so at the top right), which will allow you to read the comments I write within the code in a much neater format. Additionally, although the target audience of this tutorial is beginners, intermediate and seasoned Python coders are certainly welcome to look through the modules, whether that be to correct me for any errors in my explanation or simply to re-explore the intricacies of Python.\n\n<p style=\"font-size: 20px\"> If you like this tutorial, feel free to also check out <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/ironicninja/pandas-overview\"> this Pandas Overview Tutorial</a>.\n\n<h2> Table of Contents </h2>\n<ol>\n    <li> <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/ironicninja/introduction-to-data-science-packages-tutorial/notebook#vars\"> Python Variables </a>\n    <li> <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/ironicninja/introduction-to-data-science-packages-tutorial/notebook#lists\"> Python Lists </a>\n    <li> <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/ironicninja/introduction-to-data-science-packages-tutorial/notebook#dstructures\"> Some Other Data Structures </a>\n    <li> <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/ironicninja/introduction-to-data-science-packages-tutorial/notebook#control\"> Control Flow </a>\n    <li> <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/ironicninja/introduction-to-data-science-packages-tutorial/notebook#for\"> For Loops </a>\n    <li> <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/ironicninja/introduction-to-data-science-packages-tutorial/notebook#while\"> While Loops </a>\n    <li> <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/ironicninja/introduction-to-data-science-packages-tutorial/notebook#pmath\"> Python Math </a>\n    <li> <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/ironicninja/introduction-to-data-science-packages-tutorial/notebook#fstring\"> String Formatting </a>\n    <li> <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/ironicninja/introduction-to-data-science-packages-tutorial/notebook#func\"> Python Functions </a>\n    <li> <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/ironicninja/introduction-to-data-science-packages-tutorial/notebook#try\"> MY FAVORITE PYTHON FUNCTION </a>\n    <li> <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/ironicninja/introduction-to-data-science-packages-tutorial/notebook#comment\"> Commenting Standard </a>\n    <li> <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/ironicninja/introduction-to-data-science-packages-tutorial/notebook#fun\"> Other Cool Python Functions for Fun </a>\n</ol>\n                             \n\nThere's a lot of information that I won't cover here, like classes, objects, iterators, and more.

{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Hi everyone. \n\nI was literally overwhelmed by the responses I got on my previous [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/twinkle0705/an-interactive-eda-of-electricity-consumption) and the [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/twinkle0705/state-wise-power-consumption-in-india) I uploaded last week. All your support and suggestions keeps me going on so keep them coming.\n\nAs it is said - data science is not only about model fitting and great accuracy scores through tuning, it's more about what goes on behind the curtains. Data preprocessing is the backstage manager which makes your model work best when you've tuned it to the best parameters. \n\nSo, here is my first take on data preprocessing where I deal with various methods of filling missing values in your data. Usually, this is the first step you should take towards data preprocessing and hence it's my first step too to explain the various underlying methods you can take to fill missing values. I have tried to cover all the steps as per my knowledge and I hope to improvise it with advanced techniques in future versions. \n\nComment below for suggestions on any other methods you know of to help me and others alike. \nDo upvote if you find my effort worth it.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# MISSING VALUES","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The difference between data found in many tutorials and data in the real world is that real-world data is rarely clean and homogeneous. In particular, many interesting datasets will have some amount of data missing. To make matters even more complicated, different data sources may indicate missing data in different ways. \n\n**Why do we need to treat missing data?**\n\nMissing data in the training data set can reduce the power / fit of a model or can lead to a biased model because we have not analysed the behavior and relationship with other variables correctly. It can lead to wrong prediction or classification.\n\n\n**Why does the data have missing values?**\n\n* Missing Completely At Random (MCAR) - The reason for missingness is totally independent of the predictors and response i.e., the probability of missingness is the same for each unit in your sample.\n\n* Missing At Random (MAR) - Missingness depends only on other available information (e.g., other predictors). For example, we are collecting data for age and female has higher missing value compare to male.\n\n* Missing Not At Random (MNAR): depends on unobserved predictors -  This is a case when the missing values are not random and are related to the unobserved input variable. For example: In a medical study, if a particular diagnostic causes discomfort, then there is higher chance of drop out from the study. Here \"discomfort\" is not an input variable.\n\n* Missingn Not At Random II (MNAR): depends on the missing value itself - Missingness depends on the (potentially missing) variable itself. For example,  people with higher earnings are less likely to reveal them.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let us go ahead and look at the various ways how we can detect and handle missing data.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.Loading the libraries and data # ","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd \nimport seaborn as sns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Reading the two datasets that are going to be used to demonstrate various methods of handling missing values.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv('../input/loan-prediction/train.csv')\ncat_data = pd.read_csv('../input/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/train.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Taking a first look at our data gives us a rough idea about the variables and the kind of data it holds.

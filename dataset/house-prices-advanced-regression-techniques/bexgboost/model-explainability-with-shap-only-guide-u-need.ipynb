They **demand** model explainability.\n\nIf ML specialists are coming up with tools to understand and explain the models *they* created, the concerns and suspicions of non-technical folks are entirely justified. One of those tools introduced a few years ago is SHAP. It can break down the mechanics of any machine learning model and deep neural net to make them understandable to anyone.\n\nToday, we will learn how SHAP works and how you can use it for classical ML tasks in your practice.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/1*m0-c5e45bQH7bigxoSOnyQ.gif)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# What is SHAP and Shapley values?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a Python package based on the 2016 NIPS paper about SHAP values. The premise of this paper and Shapley values comes from approaches in game theory.\n\nOne of the questions often posed in games is that in a group of n players with different skillsets, how do we divide a prize so that everyone gets a fair share based on their skill set? Depending on the number of players, their time of joining the game, and their different contributions to the outcome, this type of calculation can become horribly complex.\n\nBut what does game theory have to do with machine learning? Well, we could reframe the above question so that it becomes \"Given a prediction, how do we most accurately measure each feature's contribution?\" Yes, it is like asking feature importances of a model, but the answer the Shapley values give is much more sophisticated.\n\nSpecifically, Shapley values can help you in:\n1. *Global model interpretability* - imagine you work for a bank and build a classification model for loan applications. Your manager wants you to explain what (and how) different factors influence the decisions of your model. Using SHAP values, you can give a concrete answer with details of which features lead to more loans and which features lead to more rejections. You make your manager happy because now, he can draw up basic guidelines for future bank customers to increase their chances of getting a loan. More loans mean more money means a happier manager means a higher salary for you.\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/1*tLpb2EdoT_-ONIA9o1U7-g.png)\n\n2. *Local interpretability* - your model rejects one of the applications submitted to the bank a few days ago. The customer claims he followed all the guidelines and was sure to get a loan from your bank. Now, you are legally obligated to explain why your model rejected that particular candidate. Using Shapley values, every case can be analyzed independently, without worrying about its connections to other samples in the data. In other words, you have local interpretability. You extract the Shapley values for the complaining customer and show them what parts of their application caused the rejection. You prove them wrong with a plot like this:\n\n![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/900/1*HTUJCmyAfYfv7iv6-soGGg.png)\n\n\nSo, how do you calculate the mighty Shapley values? That's where we start using the SHAP package.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# How to calculate Shapley values with SHAP?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The exact mathematical details of calculating Shapley values deserve an article of its own.

The reason is that all the magical details are nicely packaged inside SHAP. So, let's look at our very first example.\n\nUsing the Diamonds dataset built into Seaborn, we will be predicting diamond prices using several physical measurements.

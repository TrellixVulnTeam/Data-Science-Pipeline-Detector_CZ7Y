Charts are your friends here. Notebooks play a very important role in Kaggle and by extension plotting plays a major role as well.\n\nPython has many charting libraries. Some of them present static graphs like those from Matplotlib and Seaborn. While some present us with interactive or dynamic graphs like those in the case of Plotly, Bokeh and Altair. \n\n## Dynamic > Static\n\nLet me be honest. Static graphs look dull to me. Being able to provide other the ability to click around the plot, look at each data point closely gives them the opportunity to extract the maximum information out of the graph. You are no longer bounded by the constraints of a static plot. \n\nIn the world of Dynamic plotting in Python, Plotly has a name of its own. It is perhaps the most widely used interactive graphing library used in Kaggle. Plus with the inclusion on plotly express, it has become extremely simple to create stunning graphs as well. \n\n### So, without much ado, lets start with learning how to use Plotly Express to create graphs!"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Graphs I am planning to include in the tutorial\n\n- [x] Scatter Plots\n- [x] Line Charts\n- [x] Bar Charts\n- [x] Pie Charts\n- [x] Histogram\n- [x] Box Plot\n- [x] Violin Plot\n\nIf there's anything else you want to see, you can let me know.

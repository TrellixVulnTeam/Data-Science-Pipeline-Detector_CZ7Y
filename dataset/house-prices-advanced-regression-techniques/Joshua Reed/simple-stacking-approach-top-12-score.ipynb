In this kernel i'll be taking on the Kaggle Competition: 'House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques'. This competition uses the Ames Housing Dataset, which itself contains 1460 observations in both training and tests sets, and 80 features to boot. The challenge is to predict property Sale Price, hence this is a Regression problem. \n\nThroughout this kernel I will provide explanations about my code so you can understand the logic behind each action. While i'll conduct some feature engineering, my main focus will be to explore the predictive models and hopefully build an effective stacked model for final prediction.\n\nAt the time of posting, this model achieved a score within the top 12% of the Leaderboard, achieved through a simple approach to stacking.\n\nWell that's enough from me - enjoy the read and please feel free to share with me any feedback regarding my code or overall approach! I'm always looking to improve :)."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"4900b955c2bf021a7a689b14504921e273f0b536"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# All project packages imported at the start\n\n# Project packages\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Visualisations\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \nimport seaborn as sns\n\n# Statistics\nfrom scipy import stats\nfrom scipy.stats import norm, skew\nfrom statistics import mode\nfrom scipy.special import boxcox1p\n\n# Machine Learning\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import Lasso, Ridge, RidgeCV, ElasticNet\nimport xgboost as xgb\nimport lightgbm as lgb\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler\nfrom sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin, RegressorMixin, clone\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import KFold, cross_val_score, train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor\nfrom sklearn.kernel_ridge import KernelRidge\nfrom catboost import Pool, CatBoostRegressor, cv\n\nimport sys\nimport warnings\n\nif not sys.warnoptions:\n    warnings.simplefilter(\"ignore\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"21d8cde98b57aa706d93046a156ae26cd548d073"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Reading in the data\ntrain = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"7cbd8e5c59b8ef94d10f6c41a356cecdff15764d"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Inspecting the train dataset\ntrain.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"3aae791266629a1a1aa69a6f912d7015ef20e8ba"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# And now the test data\ntest.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"48bbda3607a8b86ffdcc4b48bcbaea4a2d8959d9"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"There a lot of object dtypes and a lot of missing values within this dataset.

I'm now quite keen to explore stacking as a means of achieving an even higher score. In a nutshell, stacking uses as a first-level (base) the predictions of a few basic classifiers and then uses another model at the second-level to predict the output from the earlier first-level predictions. Stacking can be beneficial as combining models allows the best elements of their predictive power on the given challenged to be pooled, thus smoothing over any gaps left from an individual model and increasing the likelihood of stronger overall model performance.\n\nOk, let's get model predictions and then stack the results!"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8e602a3669702e217f4e9d32f63d289c6495242d","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Fit and predict all models\nmodel_lasso.fit(X_train, y_train)\nlasso_pred = np.expm1(model_lasso.predict(X_test))\n\nmodel_elastic.fit(X_train, y_train)\nelastic_pred = np.expm1(model_elastic.predict(X_test))\n\nmodel_ridge.fit(X_train, y_train)\nridge_pred = np.expm1(model_ridge.predict(X_test))\n\nmodel_xgb.fit(X_train, y_train)\nxgb_pred = np.expm1(model_xgb.predict(X_test))\n\nmodel_gbr.fit(X_train, y_train)\ngbr_pred = np.expm1(model_gbr.predict(X_test))\n\nmodel_lgb.fit(X_train, y_train)\nlgb_pred = np.expm1(model_lgb.predict(X_test))\n\nmodel_krr.fit(X_train, y_train)\nkrr_pred = np.expm1(model_krr.predict(X_test))\n\nmodel_cat.fit(X_train, y_train)\ncat_pred = np.expm1(model_cat.predict(X_test))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"64ad3fa401e9feffa8db9d3b7062f7349d2dc806"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Final predictions\nNow to create the stacked model! I'm going to keep this very simple by equally weighting every model. This is done by summing together the models and then dividing by the total count. Weighted averages could be a means of gaining a slightly better final predictions, whereby the best performing models take a bigger cut of the stacked model. One of the more important considerations when undertaking any kind of model stacking is model independence. Stacking models that draw similar conclusions from the data is quite unlikely to yield a better score compared to a single model, because there's no additional insight being drawn out. Rather, model's that tackle the dataset in different ways, and that are able to detect unique aspects within it stand a better chance of contributing to a more powerful overall stacked model, since as a whole, more of the nuances within the data have been recognised and accounted for.\n\nPlease note, I am not going to include the CatBoost model as I found the model prediction declined when this was included - looks at the output it appears as though it is overfitting the data (visible through the differing learn/test scores). I will return to this model later with a view to improve it's application to the current dataset."},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"b82d2aa0cac967cd1ac62195b2192931bf52ffb4"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Create stacked model\nstacked = (lasso_pred + elastic_pred + ridge_pred + xgb_pred + lgb_pred + krr_pred + gbr_pred) / 7","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":false,"_uuid":"d94352be750eb1c7617ddeed5fee12eb0e903a75"},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Setting up competition submission\nsub = pd.DataFrame()\nsub['Id'] = test_ID\nsub['SalePrice'] = stacked\nsub.to_csv('house_price_predictions.csv',index=False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"08aefebb25eea162c1c0864149e1be033931cf4d"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"And there you have it! Within this kernel I have performed simple data preparation techniques before applying several models, and then combining their performance into a single stacked model. This achieved a final RMSE that pitched me within the top 12% of the leaderboard.\n\nI hope the approach and techniques on display in this kernel have been helpful in terms of not just solving the current challenges, but other regression and broader machine learning challenges. \n\nIf this kernel has indeed helped you - i'd very much like to hear it :). Please also share with me any suggestions that could improve my final model, i'm always looking to learn more. In terms of future version, I aim to tackle the following:\n\n- Perfecting the CatBoost model\n- Performing a more rigorous GridSearchCV\n- Exploring more complex methods of model stacking for better final prediction.\n\nThank you for reading :).

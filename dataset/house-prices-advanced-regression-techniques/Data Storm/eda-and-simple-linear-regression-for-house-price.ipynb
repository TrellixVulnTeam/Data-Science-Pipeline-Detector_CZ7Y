We can also deal with regression tasks by using the algorithm's regressor.  You can also deal with regression tasks by using the algorithm's regressor. \n##### We can even make trees more random by additionally using random thresholds for each feature rather than searching for the best possible thresholds (like a normal decision tree does).\n\nRandom forest, consists of a large number of individual decision trees that operate as an ensemble. Each individual tree in the random forest spits out a class prediction and the class with the most votes becomes our model’s prediction (see figure below).\n\nThe low correlation between models (trees) is the key. Just like how investments with low correlations (like stocks and bonds) come together to form a portfolio that is greater than the sum of its parts, uncorrelated models can produce ensemble predictions that are more accurate than any of the individual predictions. The reason for this wonderful effect is that the trees protect each other from their individual errors (as long as they don’t constantly all err in the same direction). \n\nOne of the biggest problems in machine learning is overfitting, but most of the time this won’t happen thanks to the random forest classifier. If there are enough trees in the forest, the classifier won’t overfit the model.\n\nThe main limitation of random forest is that a large number of trees can make the algorithm too slow and ineffective for real-time predictions.\n\nA great quality of the random forest algorithm is that it is very easy to measure the relative importance of each feature on the prediction. Sklearn provides a great tool for this that measures a feature's importance by looking at how much the tree nodes that use that feature reduce impurity across all trees in the forest. It computes this score automatically for each feature after training and scales the results so the sum of all importance is equal to one.\n\n\n## Decision Tree Algorithm\n\n- It is a tree-structured classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome.\n\n- In a Decision tree, there are two nodes, which are the Decision Node and Leaf Node. Decision nodes are used to make any decision and have multiple branches, whereas Leaf nodes are the output of those decisions and do not contain any further branches.\n\n- The decisions or the test are performed on the basis of features of the given dataset.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9bK9AF8.png)\n\n\nHere is a good description from Wikipedia: '\"In a decision tree each internal node represents a 'test' on an attribute (e.g. whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails), each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label (decision taken after computing all attributes). A node that has no children is a leaf.'\"\n\n\nFurther from [Widipedia Decision Tree Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning) - \"A decision tree or a classification tree is a tree in which each internal (non-leaf) node is labeled with an input feature. The arcs coming from a node labeled with an input feature are labeled with each of the possible values of the target feature or the arc leads to a subordinate decision node on a different input feature. Each leaf of the tree is labeled with a class or a probability distribution over the classes, signifying that the data set has been classified by the tree into either a specific class, or into a particular probability distribution (which, if the decision tree is well-constructed, is skewed towards certain subsets of classes).\"\n\n### Some guidance on the depth of the trees? How to choose the reasonable ones ?\n\n###### Deeper trees reduces the bias; more trees reduces the variance.\n\nThe most important hyper-parameter is how many features to test for each split. The more useless features there are, the more features you should try.\n\nGenerally,\n\n- **Number of trees:** the bigger the better. One way to evaluate and know when to stop is to monitor our error rate while building your forest (or any other evaluation criteria you could use) and detect when it converges. Also, the number of test nodes in your trees is upper bounded by the number of objects, so if you have lots of variables and not so many training objects, larger forest will be highly recommended in order to increase the chances of evaluating all the descriptors at least once in your forest.\n\nHowever, more trees also mean more computational cost and after a certain number of trees, the improvement is negligible. An article from Oshiro et al. (2012) pointed out that, based on their test with 29 data sets, after 128 of trees there is no significant improvement\n\n- **Tree depth:** To control how deep your trees are we can limit the maximum depth, limit the number of nodes, limit the number of objects required to split, stop splitting if the split does not sufficiently improves the fit,...). Most of the time, it is recommended to **prune (limit the depth of) the trees** if we are dealing with noisy data. Finally, we can use our fully developed trees to compute performance of shorter trees as these are a \"subset\" of the fully developed ones.\n\nstandard random forest algorithm grow the full decision tree without pruning. A single decision tree do need pruning in order to overcome over-fitting issue. However, in random forest, this issue is eliminated by random selecting the variables and the **OOB(out of bag)** action.\n\nTree correlation means that 2 trees are correlated in terms of predictor variable on which split is made. In bagging, **OOB(out of bag)** means that on average,we are able to use only 2/3rd of our dataset for building our tree and rest 1/3rd are not used.

It is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library.\n\n**What is  Boosting**\n\nBoosting is a sequential technique which works on the principle of an ensemble. How Boosting Algorithm Works?\nThe basic principle behind the working of the boosting algorithm is to generate multiple weak learners and combine their predictions to form one strong rule. These weak rules are generated by applying base Machine Learning algorithms on different distributions of the data set. These algorithms generate weak rules for each iteration. After multiple iterations, the weak learners are combined to form a strong learner that will predict a more accurate outcome.\n Note that a weak learner is one which is slightly better than random guessing. For example, a decision tree whose predictions are slightly better than 50%.\n\n**Here’s how the algorithm works**:\n\n**Step 1**: The base algorithm reads the data and assigns equal weight to each sample observation.\n\n**Step 2**: False predictions made by the base learner are identified. In the next iteration, these false predictions are assigned to the next base learner with a higher weightage on these incorrect predictions.\n\n**Step 3**: Repeat step 2 until the algorithm can correctly classify the output.\n\nTherefore, the main aim of Boosting is to focus more on miss-classified predictions.\n\nThere are three main ways through which boosting can be carried out:\n- Adaptive Boosting or AdaBoost\n- Gradient Boosting\n- XGBoost\n\nBelow we will be using **XGBoost** which is an advanced version of Gradient boosting method, it literally means eXtreme Gradient Boosting. XGBoost dominates structured or tabular datasets on classification and regression predictive modeling problems. The XGBoost library implements the [gradient boosting decision tree algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting).\n\nDifferent from the traditional gradient descent technique, gradient enhancement helps to predict the optimal gradient of the additional model. This technique can reduce the output error at each iteration.\n\nIn practice what we do in order to build the learner is to:\n- Start with single root (contains all the training examples)\n\n- Iterate over all features and values per feature, and evaluate each possible split loss reduction:\n\n- gain = loss(father instances) - (loss(left branch)+loss(right branch))\n\n- The gain for the best split must be positive (and > min_split_gain parameter), otherwise we must stop growing the branch.\n\nNormally it is impossible to enumerate all the possible tree structures q. A greedy algorithm that starts from a single leaf and iteratively adds branches to the tree is used instead. Assume that I_L and I_R are the instance sets of left and right nodes after the split. Then the loss reduction after the split is given by,\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jzyLh81.png)","metadata":{"pycharm":{"name":"#%% md\n"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"feature_model = XGBRegressor(base_score=0.5, booster='gbtree', colsample_bylevel=1,\n             colsample_bynode=1, colsample_bytree=0.6, gamma=0.0, gpu_id=-1,\n             importance_type='gain', interaction_constraints='',\n             learning_rate=0.02, max_delta_step=0, max_depth=4,\n             min_child_weight=0.0, monotone_constraints='()',\n             n_estimators=1250, n_jobs=0, num_parallel_tree=1, random_state=0,\n             reg_alpha=0, reg_lambda=1, scale_pos_weight=1, subsample=0.8,\n             tree_method='exact', validate_parameters=1, verbosity=None)\n\nfeature_classifier = Pipeline(steps=[('feature_preprocessor', feature_preprocessor),\n                      ('feature_model', feature_model)\n                     ])\n\nfeature_X_train, feature_X_valid, feature_y_train, feature_y_test = train_test_split(X_feature_engineering, y, random_state=0)\n\nfeature_classifier.fit(feature_X_train, feature_y_train, feature_model__verbose=False)\nfeature_predictions = feature_classifier.predict(feature_X_valid)\n\n# Implementing our earlier custom defined function for RMSLE\n# Root Mean Squared Log Error .

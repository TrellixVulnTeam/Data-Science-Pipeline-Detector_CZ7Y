The actions can include:\n\n* learning a relation\n* transform some feature\n* impute missing values\n* create new features\n* fit a model\n* predict on unseen data\n\nThe purpose is to apply sequentially its element to **validate a process**. On this point, we can take a moment to stress out how important is to validate the entire process rather than just the ML model itself. It is well known that different problems call for different models since it is not possible to say a priori that one model will perform better than another one on any given dataset. This is one (fairly sloppy) formulation of the so-called No free lunch theorem.\n\nTherefore, it is easy to imagine that choices in the processing stage (being this the imputation of missing entries, the scaling of the features or the feature engineered) will influence the choice of the final model, both in terms of algorithm or of hyperparameters. It is thus important to be able to assess the ability of a process to be better than another one. \n\nA trustable evaluation of your process is necessary to justify the choices you made, otherwise you can be less sure about, for example, creating a new feature as you don't know if you are increasing your cross-validation score because of a flawed process or because of the creation of a genuinely powerful predictor (or, more commonly, you are overestimating the effect of adding that new feature or not).\n\nWhile the use of pipelines is not the silver bullet to this issue, it certainly helps in excluding some common validation errors. The main one, at first, is to not apply the same transformations to the train and test sets, resulting most of the time in an error or a very weird performing model. A pipeline will take care of this issue by always applying the same transformations in sequence until the final result is achieved, no matter what dataset are you applying it on.\n\nTo see why it is not enough to carefully apply the same sequence by hand and instead relying on a Pipeline, let's have a look at a simple example. In this competition, the training set (the only one we should be looking at to simulate a real-life problem) looks like this\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_train = pd.read_csv('../input/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/train.csv')\n\ndf_train.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"And it is easy to see that we have quite a few missing values."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_train.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now, let's suppose we want to fill the missing values with the average of each column. It is not hard to do it and we are now happy about the result.\n\nWe then split our data into training and validation sets and train some models to be evaluated.\n\n**This is wrong!**\n\nBy imputing the missing values using the mean of the entire dataset and *then* splitting the data for validation, we are leaking some information from the validation set into the training one. This will most likely boost our evaluation score but not necessarily the quality of our model.\n\nOne can then argue that it is sufficient to split the data first and impute after on training and validation sets separately. However, it is important to keep in mind that the mean values (the values you will use to impute the missing entries) have to be calculated only on the training set and applied to both training and validation. In this way, you will be correctly simulating the performance of your model in your evaluation process.\n\nA pipeline will take care of that, regardless of your validation strategy (k-fold, train_test split, both...)\n\n# Existing instruments and what is tricky about them\n\nBy going through the sklearn documentation, it is easy to find that most of the operations you will commonly apply have already a very efficient implementation. For example, the imputation mentioned above can be done easily by using the `SimpleImputer`. Or, if we want to rescale our features, we can make use of the `StandardScaler`.\n\nLet's thus see how to use one of these instruments.

The reason is that, for speed and memory usage, the sklearn instruments use the dataframe as numpy arrays.

In the next sections, we will implement methods and pipelines that aim to be very flexible in order to adapt to a larger variety of problems, the downside is that we will be a bit less efficient in terms of speed and memory usage.\n\nA note before moving on: a pipeline with only 2 steps (scaler and model) will do just fine by not doing any further coding but I find it more useful to break things down and learn what happens inside.\n\n# Transformers and classes\n\nIn this section, we will see how to use the existing instruments to build something that better suits our needs (having a pipeline and maintain the DataFrame structure).\n\nFirst of all, we are going to be working with sklearn Pipelines. These will sequentially apply the `fit` and `transform` (or `predict`) methods at each step. We thus need to create objects that can do `fit` and `transform`. In python, the way to do so is to create a **class**. You can read about classes pretty much everywhere and everyone will explain them better than I could possibly do, let's just jump into an example.\n\nWe want a transformer that works like the scaler above but also maintain the DataFrame structure.

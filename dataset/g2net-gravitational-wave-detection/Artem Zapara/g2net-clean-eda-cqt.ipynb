These waves are tiny ripples of the space-time fabric coming from collisions of some super-heavy objects, like black holes or neutron stars, predicted by Einstein 100 years before. The waves can travel billions of light years before hitting the ultra-sensitive instruments, called interferometers. Constructing such a device is the result of immense work by many scientists, engineers, and information science experts from whole over the world. \n\nThe first discovery of gravitational waves was widely outreached in the scientific community, as well as in general audience media. After the first event, more than 50 similar mergers or candidates have been reported. Now, when more and more data is collected, it is needed to more accurately detect GW signals, so that it can help build a more complete picture of our universe.\n\nIn the competition, you have a training set containing simulated time series data coming from three different locations (LIGO Hanford, LIGO Livingston, both in the US, and Virgo, in Italy). Each data file (in .npy format) represents either instrument noise or noise with a simulated gravitational wave signal, and is labeled 0 or 1, respectively. These labels are stored in a different .csv file. The task is to build a system capable of identification time series instances with GW signal present. So, this is a pure **binary classification problem** well known in the ML community.

Based on this work I decided to try:\n1. Standardizing each signal, i.e., dividing by the max value of the signal.\n2. Apply spectral whitening\n3. Convert that to a spectrogram\n4. Train a CNN to recognise the \"chirp\"\n\nTo implement this I made the following choices:\n* For the CNN I used a pre-trained EfficientNet. To make this easier to code I used Keras\n* I first tried to use the spectrogram code in GWPy however I found that nnAudio ran about 100x faster, so like many other I switched to using nnAudio to create the spectrogram on the fly.\n* I tried to use the GWPy whitening function but this was too slow. As I could not find a whitening function in nnAudio or other PyTorch modules I wrote my own. First I had to understand what whitening was, then I had to code for it.\n\n\nI then ran this, using EffficientNetB3, and found that whitening the signal gave a 10% lower AUC.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-14T06:09:40.955172Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-14T06:09:40.955553Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-14T06:09:40.959541Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-14T06:09:40.955517Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-14T06:09:40.958741Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install gwpy> /dev/null","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-14T06:09:40.972379Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-14T06:09:40.972903Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-14T06:10:02.248294Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-14T06:09:40.972858Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-14T06:10:02.247132Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# What a real GW event looks like\nLoosely following the example in [GWPy](https://gwpy.github.io/docs/stable/examples/spectrogram/spectrogram2.html) I read in a 2sec sample with known Gravity Wave event and create two spectrograms. \n1.

We start by computing the short-term Fourier transform (STFT in short): this is a Fourier transform with a moving window over the signal. As a window function, we often use the Hann or Hamming windows. Finally, notice that we will use the discrete version of the STFT. The equation should be:\n\n$X[k,m] = \\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} W[n-m] x[n] e^{-j 2 \\pi k n/N}.$\n\n2. We introduce the quality factor Q using the following formula: $Q = \\frac{f_k}{\\delta f_k}.$\n\n3. Now, the window length for the k-th bin is no longer fixed (N) by will vary depending on the filter (we use the previous definition to get a simplified expression):\n\n$N[k] = \\frac{f_\\text{s}}{\\delta f_k} = \\frac{f_\\text{s}}{f_k} Q.$\n\n4. The digital frequency $\\frac{2 \\pi k}{N}$ is also changed and the window function now depends on $k$ as well (via the window length $N[k]$)\n\n5. Finaly, replacing the different elements in the original formula, we get:\n\n$X[k] = \\frac{1}{N[k]} \\sum_{n=0}^{N[k]-1} W[k,n] x[n] e^{\\frac{-j2 \\pi Qn}{N[k]}}. $","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now, let's see how it can be coded.

As a result, they are able to utilize the hardware accelerators (e.g. GPUs) thereby speeding up the model training and inference. However, the traditional machine learning libraries like scikit-learn are developed to run on CPUs and have no notion of tensors. As a result, they are unable to take advantage of GPUs and hence miss out on the potential accelerations that deep learning libraries enjoy.\n\nüëâ In this notebook, we'll learn about a library called **[Hummingbird](https://github.com/microsoft/hummingbird)**, created to bridge this gap. Hummingbird speedups up the inferencing in tradiotnal machine learning models by converting them to tensor-based models. This enables us to use model like scikit-learn's decision trees and random forest even on GPUs and take advantage of the hardware capabilities.\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*JWT4IwQsoRArNVmIZXJexQ.png)\n\n*Transforming a simple decision tree into neural networks | Reproduced from Hummingbird's [official blog](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/gray-systems-lab/articles/announcing-hummingbird-a-library-for-accelerating-inference-with-traditional-machine-learning-models/)*\n\n> üóíÔ∏è **Incase you want to know more, here is an article that goes deeper into the theory behind the library along with other useful resources:** [Speed up Inference four your scikit-learn models](https://towardsdatascience.com/speed-up-the-inference-in-traditional-machine-learning-models-by-converting-them-into-tensor-based-efe6bbe5c92d?sk=4b6761f06e81403fb6297cb4d7c66f3c)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Install the library.

We will employ some feature engineering to encode a few temporal components, conduct cross-validation (CV) and fit a Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR) model. This dataset is part of the Tabular Playground Series - July 2021 competition.\n\nIt came to my attention that most top entries in this competition exploit some leaked test data using pseudo-labeling, thereby cutting down error by a substantial margin. I am not particularly fond of leveraging leaked information and as such **no external data is used in this analysis**.\n\nWe will go over feature engineering, CV and model building using the optimal CV hyperparameter values. To start things off we will load some important utilities, set random seed and a bunch of other constants and load the CSV files.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingRegressor\nfrom sklearn.multioutput import MultiOutputRegressor\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import RepeatedKFold, GridSearchCV\n\n# Path to the files, set seed\nPATH = '../input/tabular-playground-series-jul-2021/'\nSEED = 999\nN_FOLDS = 3\nN_REPEATS = 5\nTARGET_VARS = ['target_carbon_monoxide',\n               'target_benzene',\n               'target_nitrogen_oxides']\n\nnp.random.seed(SEED)\n\n# Load CSV files\ntrain = pd.read_csv(PATH + 'train.csv')\ntest = pd.read_csv(PATH + 'test.csv')\nsubm = pd.read_csv(PATH + 'sample_submission.csv', index_col='date_time')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-26T18:49:36.38514Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-26T18:49:36.386018Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-26T18:49:38.066497Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-26T18:49:36.385566Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-26T18:49:38.06561Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Feature engineering üî®\n\nThe training predictor set is of size 7111 x 9, whereas the target set is 7111 x 3.

In the present analysis I consider the following:\n\n* Capture periodicity over month and hour using $sin$ and $cos$ encodings. If we had picked a categorical encoding instead, the model would be oblivious to the fact January and December are consecutive months. The same holds for hour of the day. As for weekdays, since there are only seven values this particular encoding might degrade model performance\n\n* Identify weekends using a single binary feature.

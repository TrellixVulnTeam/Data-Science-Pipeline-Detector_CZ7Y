Learn how to quickly integrate W&B in your Kaggle workflow [here](https://www.kaggle.com/ayuraj/experiment-tracking-with-weights-and-biases).\n\nData is at the core of every ML workflow. Tables let you visualize and query datasets and model evaluations at the example level. We can use this new tool to analyze and understand datasets, and to measure and debug model performance. I hope you will find it useful for this Kaggle competition and other competitions alike. \n\nThis Kernel is designed with Kaggle workflow in perspective. I would love to get your suggestions around Kaggle workflow and how Tables can help with the same. \n\n![img](https://i.imgur.com/P7bRGmR.gif)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# üîß Imports and Setups","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Install latest version of W&B\n!pip install -q --upgrade wandb\n\n# Import wandb\nimport wandb\n\n# Login with your autorization key\nwandb.login()","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import tensorflow as tf\nprint(tf.__version__)\nfrom tensorflow.keras import layers\nfrom tensorflow.keras import models\nimport tensorflow_addons as tfa\n\nimport os\nimport json\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\npd.set_option('mode.chained_assignment', None)\n\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I will be using images of resolution 256x256 for this kernel.

Foliar (leaf) diseases pose a major threat to the overall productivity and quality of apple orchards. The current process for disease diagnosis in apple orchards is based on manual scouting by humans, which is time-consuming and expensive.\n\nAlthough computer vision-based models have shown promise for plant disease identification, there are some limitations that need to be addressed. Large variations in visual symptoms of a single disease across different apple cultivars, or new varieties that originated under cultivation, are major challenges for computer vision-based disease identification. These variations arise from differences in natural and image capturing environments, for example, leaf color and leaf morphology, the age of infected tissues, non-uniform image background, and different light illumination during imaging etc.\n\nPlant Pathology 2020-FGVC7 challenge competition had a pilot dataset of 3,651 RGB images of foliar disease of apples. For Plant Pathology 2021-FGVC8, we have significantly increased the number of foliar disease images and added additional disease categories. This yearâ€™s dataset contains approximately 23,000 high-quality RGB images of apple foliar diseases, including a large expert-annotated disease dataset. This dataset reflects real field scenarios by representing non-homogeneous backgrounds of leaf images taken at different maturity stages and at different times of day under different focal camera settings.\n\n\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Specific Objectives**\n\nThe main objective of the competition is to develop machine learning-based models to accurately classify a given leaf image from the test dataset to a particular disease category, and to identify an individual disease from multiple disease symptoms on a single leaf image.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **Resources**\nI thank Kaggle for providing the dataset and [Data](http://https://bsapubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aps3.11390)\nwithout whom this wouldn't have been Possible. \nAlso I would like to thank [Ankur Singh](http://https://www.kaggle.com/ankursingh12/resized-plant2021) for this amazing dataset as without it , it would have taken hours and hours to train the below mentioned model.

So what we need to do , is to remove the last Fully Connected Layer and then build our model based upon it . After various changes to the model, I noticed that the model overfits whenever I add more than one layer in between the base model i.e ResNet 50V2 and the final layer .

But remember as this is a multilabel classification problem, we can't use softmax here, hence the sigmoid activation.\nAnother thing to keep in mind is that Binary crossentropy is used instead of categorical crossentropy. We use categorical cross-entropy in multi-class problems, but for multi-label problems, we use binary cross-entropy. Think of it this way, an image may have multiple labels, and we need the probabilities that each of these labels corresponds to the given image - this can be considered as n independent binary classifiers for the n labels.\n\nFor evaluation I have used F1 accuracy metrics instead of binary accuracy. F1 and its variants are better for evaluation when it comes to multiclass and multilabel problems. if you want to know F1 score works for Multilabel classification go through this https://medium.com/synthesio-engineering/precision-accuracy-and-f1-score-for-multi-label-classification-34ac6bdfb404https://medium.com/synthesio-engineering/precision-accuracy-and-f1-score-for-multi-label-classification-34ac6bdfb404.

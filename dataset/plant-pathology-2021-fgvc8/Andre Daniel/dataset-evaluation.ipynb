This current version considers six classes, namely 'healthy', 'scab', 'rust', 'powdery mildew', 'frog_eye_leaf_spot', 'complex'. \n\nDuring training session, it has been noted that a few predicted labels matched with disease in the images but not with the actual labels. Certainly, such cases compromised the model training and induced a wrong classification in the validation session. So, in an attempt to check the dataset for better training, a large sample (~15k) of the images have been reviewed an some findings have been displayed in this notebook to promote the discussion about it.\n\n**Some important considerations**\n* I´m no botanist, so my conclusions are derived from reading some specialized sites, comparing it with google images and looking at the dataset trying to find patterns;\n* The images shown here are just selected images. There might be many more misclassfied images but, again, I´m no authority in the field;\n* If, in the end, it comes to a conclusion that the dataset might have a large portion of compromised labels, the implication is that the Test Dataset and the Model Scoring might also be compromised;  \n\n**Conclusions and further considerations on the labels mismatch**\n\nOverall, whats been found is that:\n* Some images are not related to leaf diseases which should be removed from the dataset;\n* Some images have been clearly misclassified;\n* Some leaf diseases are very tricky to find on the images. A small, white spot might be an indicative of Powdery Mildew while an olive green patch might be a Scab. So probably discussion may occur as to define if a leaf is healthy or there is some disease.\n* The above point is probably related to the life cycle of the disease. An early stage might have just a weak sympton on the leaves and might go unnoticed. But a neural network could easily identify.\n* The *complex* class contains a large subset of images that might be classified differently as, for instance, a 'two label' classification. This might be a source of error in the training/testing step.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"____________________________________________________\n# Summary:\n0.

Misclassification\nAnother set of images have been found to be misclassified. Below there are some examples of misclassification. Reminder: these are just some selected images and does not compreheend all the images that are set with the wrong labels.\n\n## **a. Healthy subset**\nThe following images have been found in the healthy sub dataset. Each image title is the possible classification.\n##### Some images have only a trace of the disease. For instance, the images:\n\n    bdd290c8cbc9aca9.jpg - small yellow spot (rust) and white material on the leaf tip\n    aa896f86f43a38b1.jpg - has a few olive-green patches \n    efbcc09086859ebc.jpg - has a white silky spot near the stem.\n    ad8addd454e14a6c.jpg - has a very light clearer spot near the stem on the upper side of the leaf.\n    \nOn these images it can be argued that the disease lifecycle matter for the classification. Image *ce5b7057c3259c1c.jpg* has a very obvious Powdery Mildew infection but image *bdd290c8cbc9aca9.jpg* is not that clear. In fact a large portion of images has a light powdery mildew infection on the leaf tip that went unnoticed (of course if that actually is powdery mildew, I´m no specialist). Some other cases are similar to picture *efbcc09086859ebc.jpg* which a small white patch is somewhere on the blade of the leaf.\nThe question put here is, in which stage if any the leaf should be classified as healthy or with any contamination.

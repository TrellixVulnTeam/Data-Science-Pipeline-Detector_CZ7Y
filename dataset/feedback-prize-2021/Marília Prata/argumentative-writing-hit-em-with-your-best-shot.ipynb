Also i think its unfair to the other students that you are on the soccer team but have grades that are failing and you miss practice all the time because you have detention. Its fair do have the honor students play for are school even if there not the best in the school. Also its unfair to you. You will have bad grades but do well in sports. You should do a activity i agree with that but only if your grades are high. Why would you want bad grades? you should pass. Also it just does not seem right.

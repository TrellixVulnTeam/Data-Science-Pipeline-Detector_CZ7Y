Evaluating Student Writing**\n* An automated tool to evaluate student writing and provide personlized feedback. \n* Automatically segment text and classify the text among the following rhetorical and argumentative elements:\n    * ***Lead***\n    * ***Position***\n    * ***Claim***\n    * ***Counterclaim***\n    * ***Rebuttal***\n    * ***Evidence***\n    * ***Concluding Statement***\n    \n### **Evaluation**\n* Evaluation based on the overlap between the ground truth and predicted word indices.\n* The final score is calculated using **TP/FP/FN** for each class, followed by **macro F1 score** across all classes.\n* Unmatched ground truths are **false negatives (FN)**.\n* Unmatched predictions are **false positives (FP)**.\n* True Positive (TP) -

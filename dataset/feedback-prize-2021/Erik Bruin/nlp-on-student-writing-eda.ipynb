U.S. News & World Report ranked GSU as one of the most innovative universities in the nation. GSU awards more bachelor’s degrees to African-Americans than any other non-profit college or university in the country. GSU and The Learning Agency Lab, an independent nonprofit based in Arizona, are focused on developing science of learning-based tools and programs for social good.\n\nIn this competition, you’ll identify elements in student writing. More specifically, you will automatically segment texts and classify argumentative and rhetorical elements in essays written by 6th-12th grade students. You'll have access to the largest dataset of student writing ever released in order to test your skills in natural language processing, a fast-growing area of data science.\n\nIf successful, you'll make it easier for students to receive feedback on their writing and increase opportunities to improve writing outcomes. Virtual writing tutors and automated writing systems can leverage these algorithms while teachers may use them to reduce grading time. The open-sourced algorithms you come up with will allow any educational organization to better help young writers develop.","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.043611,"end_time":"2022-02-06T13:43:52.364884","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-02-06T13:43:52.321273","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom glob import glob\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport matplotlib.style as style\nstyle.use('fivethirtyeight')\nfrom matplotlib.ticker import FuncFormatter\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom tqdm.notebook import tqdm\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\nimport spacy\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\nimport os","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-input":true,"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-06T13:43:52.452622Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-06T13:43:52.451369Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-06T13:44:05.03955Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-06T13:44:05.038791Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-06T13:05:02.819938Z"},"papermill":{"duration":12.632175,"end_time":"2022-02-06T13:44:05.039722","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-02-06T13:43:52.407547","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train = pd.read_csv('../input/feedback-prize-2021/train.csv')\ntrain[['discourse_id', 'discourse_start', 'discourse_end']] = train[['discourse_id', 'discourse_start', 'discourse_end']].astype(int)\n\nsample_submission = pd.read_csv('../input/feedback-prize-2021/sample_submission.csv')\n\n#The glob module finds all the pathnames matching a specified pattern according to the rules used by the Unix shell\ntrain_txt = glob('../input/feedback-prize-2021/train/*.txt') \ntest_txt = glob('../input/feedback-prize-2021/test/*.txt')","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-06T13:44:05.129137Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-06T13:44:05.128201Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-06T13:44:07.867254Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-06T13:44:07.866691Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-06T13:05:13.761069Z"},"papermill":{"duration":2.786403,"end_time":"2022-02-06T13:44:07.86746","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-02-06T13:44:05.081057","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Introduction to the competition\n\nBasically, we have a bunch of essays written by kids in the age range of about 12-18 years old in which we have to find word sequences that can be classified as one of 7 \"discourse types\".

NER Introduction\n\nNamed Entity Recognition (NER) is the technique that works best for this challenge. If you are looking for more info on this, the free course on Hugging Face is strongly recommended. In the section [Token Classification](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter7/2?fw=pt), we can find the following things that are relevant here:\n- Named entity recognition (NER): Find the entities (such as persons, locations, or organizations) in a sentence. This can be formulated as attributing a label to each token by having one class per entity and one class for “no entity.”\n- Chunking: Find the tokens that belong to the same entity. This task (which can be combined with POS or NER) can be formulated as attributing one label (usually B-) to any tokens that are at the beginning of a chunk, another label (usually I-) to tokens that are inside a chunk, and a third label (usually O) to tokens that don’t belong to any chunk.\n\nBasically, what is being used in this competition is NER Chunking. Darek Kłeczek wrote a great notebook that explains the ideas behind this (please upvote!): [Visual Tutorial NER Chunking Token Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/thedrcat/visual-tutorial-ner-chunking-token-classification).\n\nIn this section, I am only going to show how these NER labels can be made for this competition. I am basically using the loop found in Chris Deotte's great notebook [PyTorch - BigBird - NER - [CV 0.615]](https://www.kaggle.com/cdeotte/pytorch-bigbird-ner-cv-0-615) (Please upvote his notebook!), but tried to make it a little easier to understand.

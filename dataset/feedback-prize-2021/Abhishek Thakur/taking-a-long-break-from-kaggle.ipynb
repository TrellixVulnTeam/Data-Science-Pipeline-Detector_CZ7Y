The recent events on Kaggle: me sharing a notebook (as usual) and then some people ganging up on me for that has taken a toll on me. And this was not the first time it happened. Instead of ignoring the trolls, I participated. I trolled them too. But that is how I am. I cannot just sit and listen to others when I know that they are wrong. \n\nWith that said, I have decided to take a long break from Kaggle. I will no longer be participating in any competitions, sharing any notebooks, discussions, and datasets anymore. I will still use Kaggle for their awesome competition datasets and make tutorials and scripts that I will share on my YouTube channel and GitHub. I will still continue to help others and share stuff as I usually do but only on Twitter, LinkedIn, Youtube, and Github. Also, I will finish the kaggledays challenge as I have already committed that to my team. I never thought this day would come but this is what it is. I learned so much from Kaggle and loved the good old days when there was no animosity. It's sad, but it's probably for the best. \n\nI ðŸ’™ Kaggle and always will!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here is the training code: https://github.com/abhishekkrthakur/long-text-token-classification","metadata":{}}]}

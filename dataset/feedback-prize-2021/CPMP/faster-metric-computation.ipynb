This is extremely valuable because metric computation is otften tricky, and finding the right python code for it can be time consuming. Rob saved lots of time for many here.\n\nversion 3: After I published my notebook Rob commented this:\n\n*Just a heads up that you might be using an earlier version of my code from before the host clarified that the evaluation metric is indeed macro_f1. If you look at the latest version of my notebook the original score_feedback_comp function is replaced with score_feedback_comp_micro and the new score_feedback_comp scores the macro f1 based off each class. You can still use the older version but will just need to call it on each class individually and then average.*\n\nHere is an updated version which takes Rob's comment into account hopefully.\n\nVersion 4: typo fixes.\n\nVersion 5: I moved the prediction string split before the outer join.  It speeds up code further.\n\nVersion 6: I added a variant of the code which gets a perfect score of 1 when ground truth is used as prediction.\n\nVersion 7: Some typo fixes and further optimisation of the variant code.\n\nVersion 8: There is no need to explicitly compute the match between predictions and ground truth to compute the score. Our perfect score code benefits from it.\n\nVersion 9. Typos fixes.\n\nLet me reproduce Rob's code to start with.","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-02-12T15:52:44.363658Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-02-12T15:52:44.36414Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-02-12T15:52:44.371552Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-02-12T15:52:44.364104Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-02-12T15:52:44.370362Z"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\n# from Rob Mulla @robikscube\n# https://www.kaggle.com/robikscube/student-writing-competition-twitch\ndef calc_overlap(row):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates the overlap between prediction and\n    ground truth and overlap percentages used for determining\n    true positives.\n    \"\"\"\n    set_pred = set(row.predictionstring_pred.split(\" \"))\n    set_gt = set(row.predictionstring_gt.split(\" \"))\n    # Length of each and intersection\n    len_gt = len(set_gt)\n    len_pred = len(set_pred)\n    inter = len(set_gt.intersection(set_pred))\n    overlap_1 = inter / len_gt\n    overlap_2 = inter / len_pred\n    return [overlap_1, overlap_2]\n\ndef score_feedback_comp_micro(pred_df, gt_df):\n    \"\"\"\n    A function that scores for the kaggle\n        Student Writing Competition\n\n    Uses the steps in the evaluation page here:\n        https://www.kaggle.com/c/feedback-prize-2021/overview/evaluation\n    \"\"\"\n    gt_df = (\n        gt_df[[\"id\", \"discourse_type\", \"predictionstring\"]]\n        .reset_index(drop=True)\n        .copy()\n    )\n    pred_df = pred_df[[\"id\", \"class\", \"predictionstring\"]].reset_index(drop=True).copy()\n    pred_df[\"pred_id\"] = pred_df.index\n    gt_df[\"gt_id\"] = gt_df.index\n    # Step 1. all ground truths and predictions for a given class are compared.\n    joined = pred_df.merge(\n        gt_df,\n        left_on=[\"id\", \"class\"],\n        right_on=[\"id\", \"discourse_type\"],\n        how=\"outer\",\n        suffixes=(\"_pred\", \"_gt\"),\n    )\n    joined[\"predictionstring_gt\"] = joined[\"predictionstring_gt\"].fillna(\" \")\n    joined[\"predictionstring_pred\"] = joined[\"predictionstring_pred\"].fillna(\" \")\n\n    joined[\"overlaps\"] = joined.apply(calc_overlap, axis=1)\n\n    # 2.

It rather uses both the total number of predictions, and the total number of ground truth.  It also removes the computation of the match between ground truth and predictions. This code is a faster than our code above, but it computes values a bit different than Rob's code. Good news is that it does compute a value of 1 when the ground truth is used as prediction.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def calc_overlap3(set_pred, set_gt):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculates if the overlap between prediction and\n    ground truth is enough fora potential True positive\n    \"\"\"\n    # Length of each and intersection\n    try:\n        len_gt = len(set_gt)\n        len_pred = len(set_pred)\n        inter = len(set_gt & set_pred)\n        overlap_1 = inter / len_gt\n        overlap_2 = inter/ len_pred\n        return overlap_1 >= 0.5 and overlap_2 >= 0.5\n    except:  # at least one of the input is NaN\n        return False\n\ndef score_feedback_comp_micro3(pred_df, gt_df, discourse_type):\n    \"\"\"\n    A function that scores for the kaggle\n        Student Writing Competition\n        \n    Uses the steps in the evaluation page here:\n        https://www.kaggle.com/c/feedback-prize-2021/overview/evaluation\n    \"\"\"\n    gt_df = gt_df.loc[gt_df['discourse_type'] == discourse_type, \n                      ['id', 'predictionstring']].reset_index(drop=True)\n    pred_df = pred_df.loc[pred_df['class'] == discourse_type,\n                      ['id', 'predictionstring']].reset_index(drop=True)\n    pred_df['pred_id'] = pred_df.index\n    gt_df['gt_id'] = gt_df.index\n    pred_df['predictionstring'] = [set(pred.split(' ')) for pred in pred_df['predictionstring']]\n    gt_df['predictionstring'] = [set(pred.split(' ')) for pred in gt_df['predictionstring']]\n    \n    # Step 1. all ground truths and predictions for a given class are compared.\n    joined = pred_df.merge(gt_df,\n                           left_on='id',\n                           right_on='id',\n                           how='outer',\n                           suffixes=('_pred','_gt')\n                          )\n    overlaps = [calc_overlap3(*args) for args in zip(joined.predictionstring_pred, \n                                                     joined.predictionstring_gt)]\n    \n    # 2.

One convenient way to generate additional data is simply to transform the given data into something slightly different, such that it still represents the assigned labels. As well as helping during training, augmentation can also be used when running inference (Test Time Augmentation or TTA).\n\nFor an image based challenge, flips, rotations, etc. can be used to generate a new image that still presents the same class of object as the original. But how do we do this for a NLP challenge?\n\nThere are a wide variety of approaches, from character and word substitutions, all the way to translating the text from the source lanaguage to another and then back to get a setence with (hopefully) the same meaning, but a different structure.\n\nFor more info, vad13irt has already posted a great survey here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/feedback-prize-2021/discussion/295277\n\nFor this notebook, I want to focus on what the application of some of these methods actually looks like for the feedback-prize-2021 dataset.

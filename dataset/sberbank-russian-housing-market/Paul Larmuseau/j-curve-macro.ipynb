At first, the country's total value of imports (goods purchased from abroad) exceeds its total value of exports (goods sold abroad), resulting in a trade deficit. But eventually, the currency devaluation reduces the price of its exports. Consequently, the country's level of exports gradually recovers, and the country moves back to a trade surplus.\n\nSo we are searching a devaluation \n----\n\nit happened between at 1700 (don't know the date, i don't mind even)\nits visible in the balance trade deficit, we are at the bottom of the J curve at the time being"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"9b303cbd-e01f-c887-de62-9b0fa22d404e"},"outputs":[],"source":"from matplotlib import pyplot\nmacropl=macro[['balance_trade']]\nmacropl.plot()\npyplot.show()"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"918d3520-48b0-8c0c-7f31-f515fdd0bbc5"},"source":"devaluation is visible on the exchange rates and the 'brent' rate, the cpi or price index... and the ppi shows cleary a bump on the road."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"9417d62f-fd3a-84f1-5ae4-bee97a5a7fdf"},"outputs":[],"source":"from matplotlib import pyplot\nmacropl2=macro[['cpi','ppi','usdrub','brent']]\nmacropl2.plot()\npyplot.show()"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"91fe8877-2f13-fcfe-9f8f-0b6a75b9a890"},"source":"people are hamstering money, since they sence something happened to their value of the money\nsalary are steady increasing, no inflation visible yet... so the simple working man is the one paying for the time being"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"392ba5b2-e6f4-80d6-0b04-96b41e8b141a"},"outputs":[],"source":"from matplotlib import pyplot\nmacropl=macro[['deposits_value']]\nmacropl2=macro[['mortgage_value','construction_value']]\nmacropl3=macro[['salary','invest_fixed_assets']]\nmacropl.plot()\nmacropl2.plot()\nmacropl3.plot()\npyplot.show()"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7fe97292-7fc1-a4c4-f5d5-141b0cce8061"},"source":"this is the interestrate spike i was searching for, after a devaluation you get a spike in interestrate\nAnd the mortgage rate tended to be extremely high.

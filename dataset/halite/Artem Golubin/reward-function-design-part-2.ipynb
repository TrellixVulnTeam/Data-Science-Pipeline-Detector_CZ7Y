Environment state representation.](https://www.kaggle.com/artgol89/environment-state-representation-part-1)<br>\n[Part 2. Reward function design.](https://www.kaggle.com/artgol89/reward-function-design-part-2)<br>\nPart 3. RL-agent training (baseline).\n\n**The goal of this kernel**\n\nDesigning own reward function for training rl-agents in ship controlling.\n\n**Some problems of the basic reward function**\n\n* rare rewards\n* not scaled rewards\n* not estimated collisions, ship losses, extra movements, collection of halite by ships\n* in order to receive positive reinforcement, it is necessary to carry out a relatively complex sequence of actions\n* it's impossible to evaluate the actions of each controlled unit individually\n\n**Reward function description**\n\nThis reward function will evaluate the actions of each friendly ship individually, as well as calculate the total amount of points scored in each game step.\n\nWhen designing this reward system, the main ideas were as follows:\n* ships shouldn't move aimlessly on the map\n* losing ships in a collision is bad\n* the more halite collected / delivered, the greater the reward\n* halite delivery to the shipyard is more important than its collection\n\nThe reward function will evaluate the following actions:\n* each movement during which there will be no collection, delivery or capture of the halite from an enemy ship, will be estimated as -0.01\n* parking on empty cells or on the cells where the halite is exhausted, will be estimated as -0.01\n* collection of halite from cells or capture from enemy ships, will be evaluated on the basis of the range [+0.03, +0.05, +0.07, +0.1], depending on the collected amount of halite\n* halite delivery to a shipyard, will be evaluated on the basis of the range [+0.25, +0.5, +0.75, +1.0], depending on the collected amount of halite\n* ship loss will be estimated as -0.5\n\nThis function won't evaluate ships to shipyards conversion and new ships generation.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Importing

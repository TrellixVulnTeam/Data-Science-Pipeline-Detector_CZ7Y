Thus $.75^m H$ remains after m steps mining, and $(1-0.75^m) H$ is mined by the ship.  Note: since the halite increases by 2% each square, this can be modified to account for that; it is a small adjustment and we will ignore it for the time being.\n$$ \\text{Total Mined}=(1-.75^m) H $$\n\n\n## PROBLEM 2 \nA ship can travel to a square in $n_1$ steps, mine the halite there (at 25% each step) and then return to a shipyard that is $n_2$ steps from the halite cell.

The game is **Halite** by **Two Sigma**. It is a resource management game where you build and control a small armada of ships. Your algorithms determine their movements to collect halite, a luminous energy source. The most halite at the end of the match wins, but it's up to you to figure out how to make effective and efficient moves. You control your fleet, build new ships, create shipyards, and mine the regenerating halite on the game board.<br>\nWe would be using Actor-Critic agent, as our base reinforcement learning model. The purpose of the agent would be to predict moves to control the direction of the ship to collect halite and deposit them in the shipyard.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Rules of the Game\nTo go through details about the rules of the game I would recommend the notebook [Getting started with Halite](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/getting-started-with-halite) by [Alexis Cook](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook).

It is categorized with supervised learning and unsupervised learning, rather than categorizing it with Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Reinforcement learning is the methodology that deals with the interaction between agent and environment  through actions and has got nothing to do with labeled and unlabeled data,  although there is another category called **Semi-supervised learning**, which is indeed a hybrid of supervised and unsupervised learning.<br><br>\nThe word \"reinforce\" means strengthen or support (an object or substance), especially with additional material.\n<br>\nBut what we are strengthening here, and what is our support which strengthen?<br>\nWe are trying to strengthen the learning ability of an **agent** to understand the environment. But that also happens in machine learning and deep learning, where the model is trained and the model learns a pattern from the trained data while minimizing the loss and improving the accuracy. The factor that strengthens the learning ability in reinforcement learning is **Reward**. A high positive reward is awarded to the agent for making a correct decision, and the agent should be penalized for making a wrong decision. The agent should get a slight negative reward for not making a correct decision after every time-step. \"Slight\" negative because we would prefer our agent to take more time in taking a decision rather than making the wrong decision.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Now, lets talk about some of the most important terms like agent, policy, states.\n<br>\nIn reinforcement learning an **Agent** is a self-learning model that learns some type of interaction between it and the environment. The agent wants to achieve some kind of **goal** within mentioned environment while it interacts with it. This interaction is divided into time steps. In each time step, **action** is performed by agent. This action changes the **state** of the environment and based on the success of it agent gets a certain **reward**. This way the agent learns what actions should be performed an which shouldn’t in a defined environment state.

So, I faced some problems which I would discuss now and also how I tried to solve some of them.\n* Controlling only one ship - I have made this program in a way that the agent could only control one ship at a time. Which indeed means I have disabled the respawning of multiple ships.\n* 5 Moves Game - Due to the first problem I have made this game limited up to the prediction of 4 direction(East, West, North, South) and predicting when to transform from ship to ship-yard. I have removed the SPAWN feature from prediction because I still had not discovered any way to control multiple ships through Actor-Critic agent.\n* Deposit to the last shipyard - If there is no ship, the ship would spawn from the most recent shipyard developed and would deposit halites to the most recent shipyard developed. It would have been better if I would have discovered a way to calculate the nearest shipyard for deposition of collected halites. \n![chess](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.GTWpPAXsc0-kjWXyEqpGywHaEt%26pid%3DApi&f=1)","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## The Actor-Critic model","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"id":"HCPI5mpD-Y-F"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def ActorModel(num_actions,in_):\n    common = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='tanh')(in_)\n    common = tf.keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='tanh')(common)\n    common = tf.keras.layers.Dense(num_actions, activation='softmax')(common)\n    \n    return common","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"id":"LAax9a8q-Y-L"},"cell_type":"code","source":"def CriticModel(in_):\n    common = tf.keras.layers.Dense(128)(in_)\n    common = tf.keras.layers.ReLU()(common)\n    common = tf.keras.layers.Dense(32)(common)\n    common = tf.keras.layers.ReLU()(common)\n    common = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)(common)\n    \n    return common","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"id":"ODputeIs-Y-T","outputId":"7b620300-daaf-4699-eb97-d8d1bd52dbec"},"cell_type":"code","source":"input_ = tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=[441,])\nmodel = tf.keras.Model(inputs=input_, outputs=[ActorModel(5,input_),CriticModel(input_)])\nmodel.summary()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"id":"G8a9NRpJ-Y-Z"},"cell_type":"code","source":"optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(lr=7e-4)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"id":"t_r9VCHQ-Y-e"},"cell_type":"code","source":"huber_loss = tf.keras.losses.Huber()\naction_probs_history = []\ncritic_value_history = []\nrewards_history = []\nrunning_reward = 0\nepisode_count = 0\nnum_actions = 5\neps = np.finfo(np.float32).eps.item()\ngamma = 0.99  #

In simple words, we have successfully trained our agent to direct the ship to collect halites in the most efficient way possible. I wish if I could have found a way to track the nearest shipyard and deposits collected halites or find a way to control multiple agents through reinforcement learning. Although there are research papers which I found explaining Multi-Reinforcement learning and Multi-goal Reinforcement learning, which I think could be more useful to solve this problem.

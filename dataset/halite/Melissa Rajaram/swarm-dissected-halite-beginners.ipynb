Your algorithms determine the ship's movements to collect halite, and the agent with the most halite at the end of the match wins. Your algorithms control your fleet, build new ships, create shipyards, and mine the regenerating halite. This version of Halite contains rule changes as compared to previous versions.\n\n\nLet's take a look at the gameplay before we break down the components.

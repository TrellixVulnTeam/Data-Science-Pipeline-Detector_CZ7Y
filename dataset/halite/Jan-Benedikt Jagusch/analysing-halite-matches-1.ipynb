For example, this is the \"battlestation\" of #3 player [reCurse](https://recursive.cc/blog/halite-iii-postmortem.html):\n\n![reCurse's battlestation](https://recursive.cc/blog/halite-iii-battlestation.png)\n\n\n\nWith this notebook, I am attemtping to start a series that will demonstrate how to get the most information out of the environment data. I am trying to write three notebooks:\n\n1. How to extract and transform the data from the environment (this one!)\n1. How to store the extracted data in Google Big Query and build dashboards with DataStudio (stay tuned!)\n1. How to build dashboards with Jupyter and Voila (stay tuned!)\n\nMaybe at the end of this project we will have our own \"battlestation\" or something similar. :)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**In this notebook you will learn:**\n\n- How to convert all environment information to pandas dataframes.\n- How to add \"MINE\" and \"DEPOSIT\" actions to the ships.\n- How to extract collisions for the environment.\n- And much more!\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## General Information\n\n### Pandas pipelines\n\nIn this notebook, I use a lot of pipelining in Pandas. If you have not heard of Pandas pipelines before, please refer to this fantastic [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXGCKqo5cEY) from [Vicent Warmerdam](https://twitter.com/fishnets88).\n\n### UID bug\n\nCurrently there is [a bug](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-environments/issues/15) in the interpreter, which stops the step count from incrementing in the first turn. This causes the `uid` to be non-unique, when units are created in the second turn. This also affects this analysis. Don't be too surprised when seeing duplicate uid. I won't attempt to patch this here because I am assuming this will be resolved in the next release.\n\n### WIP\n\nThis is a work in progress. Right now, there is not a lot of explanatory comments yet. I will try to add these over the next days. All plots only serve to show to potential of this data. Proper plotting will be done in the next notebooks.\n\n**Feedback is very appreciated!**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Setup"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"! pip install kaggle_environments==0.2.1 mypy","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from typing import List\nimport json","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from kaggle_environments import make\nfrom kaggle_environments.envs.halite.halite import get_to_pos\nfrom kaggle_environments.utils import Struct\nimport pandas as pd","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Building the example match"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I was having difficulties presenting a reproducible match, even when setting the random number seed.

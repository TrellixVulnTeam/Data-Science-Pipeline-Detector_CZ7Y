{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This is my first competition and shared notebook so please forgive any newbie mistake.\n\nAs part of participating in the Halite competition, I've looked at what top players do from time to time. This morning I've noticed that Leukocyte has been winning against the runaway No. 1 mzotkiew so I took a closer look at what happened.\n\nIn short, Leukocyte seems to have taken hunting strategy up a notch. I look at the number of ships with zero halite as an indication of the level of hunting. In this game (https://www.kaggle.com/c/halite/submissions?dialog=episodes-episode-2473070), Leukocyte had a very high percentage of his ships with zero halite from step 80 onward. It reaches the peak at around step 300 when all his ships were hunting and how efficient they were! His total halite jumped from 1000 to 8000 in about 70-80 steps. In comparison, mzotkiew does not dedicate as many ships to hunting.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import json\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport statistics\n\nplayer_reward = []\nnum_ship = []\nzero_hal = []\ncargo = []\ndef calculate_stats(filename):\n    global player_reward\n    global num_ship\n    global zero_hal\n    global cargo\n    with open(filename, \"r\") as read_file:\n        dev = json.load(read_file)\n        player_reward.clear()\n        num_ship.clear()\n        zero_hal.clear()\n        cargo.clear()\n        for player in range(0,4):\n            player_reward.append([])\n            num_ship.append([])\n            zero_hal.append([])\n            cargo.append([])\n        for step in range(0,400):\n            for player in range(0,4):\n                player_reward[player].append(dev[\"steps\"][step][player][\"reward\"])\n                num_ship[player].append(len(dev[\"steps\"][step][0][\"observation\"][\"players\"][player][2]))\n                #print(f' Step {step} Player: {player} H: {dev[\"steps\"][step][player][\"reward\"]}'\n                #      f' ship: {len(dev[\"steps\"][step][0][\"observation\"][\"players\"][player][2])}')\n                sl = dev[\"steps\"][step][0][\"observation\"][\"players\"][player][2]\n                val_list = [k for k, v in sl.items() if v[1] == 0]\n                # print(f' H0 list: {val_list}')\n                zero_hal[player].append(len(val_list))\n                cg = 0\n                for v in sl.values():\n                    cg += v[1]\n                cargo[player].append(cg)\n\ndef plot(filename):\n    global player_reward\n    global num_ship\n    global zero_hal\n    calculate_stats(filename)\n\n    fig, ax1 = plt.subplots(figsize=(12,4.5))\n    ax1.set_ylabel('Halite')\n    ax1.set_xlabel('Step')\n    ax1.plot(player_reward[0],'y')\n    ax1.plot(player_reward[1],'r')\n    ax1.plot(player_reward[2],'g')\n    ax1.plot(player_reward[3],'m')\n    ax1.axis([0, 400, 0, 10000])\n    ax1.set_title('Reward')\n\n    fig, ax2 = plt.subplots(figsize=(12,4.5))\n    ax2.set_ylabel('Ship')\n    ax2.set_xlabel('Step')\n    ax2.plot(num_ship[0],'y')\n    ax2.plot(num_ship[1],'r')\n    ax2.plot(num_ship[2],'g')\n    ax2.plot(num_ship[3],'m')\n    ax2.axis([0, 400, 0, 40])\n    ax2.set_title('No. of Ships over time')\n\n    fig, ax3 = plt.subplots(figsize=(12,4.5))\n    ax3.set_ylabel('Ship')\n    ax3.set_xlabel('Step')\n    ax3.plot(zero_hal[0],'y')\n    ax3.plot(zero_hal[1],'r')\n    ax3.plot(zero_hal[2],'g')\n    ax3.plot(zero_hal[3],'m')\n    ax3.axis([0, 400, 0, 30])\n    ax3.set_title('No. of Ships w/ 0 halite over time')\n    plt.show()\n    \n    fig, ax4 = plt.subplots(figsize=(12,4.5))\n    ax4.set_ylabel('Cargo')\n    ax4.set_xlabel('Step')\n    ax4.plot(cargo[0],'y')\n    ax4.plot(cargo[1],'r')\n    ax4.plot(cargo[2],'g')\n    ax4.plot(cargo[3],'m')\n    ax4.axis([0, 400, 0, 3000])\n    ax4.set_title('Cargo of Ships over time')\n    plt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"plot('../input/leu-mzot/2473070_leu_yellow_mzot_red.json')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"A second example. https://www.kaggle.com/c/halite/submissions?dialog=episodes-episode-2478393 You can see that Leukocyte collects most of his Halite after step 300.

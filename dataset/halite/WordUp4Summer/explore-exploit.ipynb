In this game, there are advantages and distadvantages of both strategies:\n\n* Exploration: the ship can look up the surrounding area and find the cells with larger number of halites, but it costs time to travel to the desired area, also it risks getting collision with other ships\n* Exploitation: the ship choose to either stay at the current position to mine or move a little bit to the surround area, but it might find nothing by just looking around aimlessly\n\nThere are differeny ways to achieve the transition between exploration and exploitation, here I used a probability paramter EPSILON to decide which way to go.

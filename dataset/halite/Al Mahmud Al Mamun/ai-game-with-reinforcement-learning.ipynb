The game is **Halite** by **Two Sigma**. It is a resource management game where you build and control a small armada of ships. Your algorithms determine their movements to collect halite, a luminous energy source. The most halite at the end of the match wins, but it's up to you to figure out how to make effective and efficient moves. You control your fleet, build new ships, create shipyards, and mine the regenerating halite on the game board.<br>\nWe would be using Actor-Critic agent, as our base reinforcement learning model. The purpose of the agent would be to predict moves to control the direction of the ship to collect halite and deposit them in the shipyard.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Rules of the Game\nTo go through details about the rules of the game I would recommend the notebook [Getting started with Halite](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook/getting-started-with-halite) by [Alexis Cook](https://www.kaggle.com/alexisbcook).

The part of the agent responsible for this output is called the **actor**.\n* Estimated rewards in the future: Sum of all rewards it expects to receive in the future. The part of the agent responsible for this output is the **critic**.\n\nAgent and Critic learn to perform their tasks, such that the recommended actions from the actor maximize the rewards.<br>\nSource - [Keras.io](https://keras.io/examples/rl/actor_critic_cartpole/)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"##

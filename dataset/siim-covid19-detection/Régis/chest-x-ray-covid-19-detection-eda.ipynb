This disease is similar to other pneumonias, which makes it difficult to diagnose. The idea of the project is to **detect and localize COVID-19** in order to help doctors to provide a quick and confident diagnosis. This will allow them to get the right treatment before severe effects of the virus.\n\nThe reason for using chest X-rays is that they are very easy to take and obtained in minutes. In addition, we can locate the disease and get a better idea of the patient's condition.\n\nIn this notebook, we will **visualise and understand** the data from a dataset X-rays. The objective is to get an overview of the data and to see if some information can be gathered.

Thus, DX offers superior throughput compared to CR.\n\nMore information :\n> Computed radiography (CR) cassettes use photo-stimulated luminescence screens to capture the X-ray image, instead of traditional X-ray film. The CR cassette goes into a reader to convert the data into a digital image. Digital radiography (DR) systems use active matrix flat panels consisting of a detection layer deposited over an active matrix array of thin film transistors and photodiodes. With DR the image is converted to digital data in real-time and is available for review within seconds.\n\n> While both CR and DR have a wider dose range and can be post processed to eliminate mistakes and avoid repeat examinations, DR has some significant advantages over CR. DR improves workflow by producing higher quality images instantaneously while providing two to three times more dose efficiency than CR.\n\n> The good and bad of CR is that it enables digital imaging with the traditional workflow of X-ray film. With CR, like film, no synchronization to the generator is required, which had been a requirement for DR imaging. However, recent advances in DR panels are improving their flexibility, portability, and affordability.\n\nCited : Rick Colbeth - June 6, 2016 - https://www.vareximaging.com/computed-radiography-cr-and-digital-radiography-dr-which-should-you-choose","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Body Part Examined","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"image_metadata[\"Body Part Examined\"].value_counts()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-15T11:15:45.322979Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-15T11:15:45.323434Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-15T11:15:45.339723Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-15T11:15:45.323371Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-15T11:15:45.338587Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Regarding the different words, I think we can regroup the words that seems to be *Thorax* (*TORAX*, *T?RAX*, *THORAX*, *2- TORAX*, *TÃ’RAX*).\n\n- The empty category is a bit odd.

To summarise some of the main ideas:\n- We have unbalanced data.\n- A study can contain several images. Those images can be duplicated.\n- The brightness of the images changes a lot.\n- According to the metadata, the set of images corresponds well to the location of the chest.\n- The image appear to be square and its size is concentrated between 2000 and 3000 pixels.\n- The images were taken equally between CR and DX. \n\n\nThank you for your reading time. I hope you found this notebook usefull. Let me know if you like it or not. And if you have questions or remarks don't hesitate :)","metadata":{}}]}

Like other pneumonias, pulmonary infection with COVID-19 results in inflammation and fluid in the lungs. COVID-19 looks very similar to other viral and bacterial pneumonias on chest radiographs, which makes it difficult to diagnose. This computer vision model for detection and localization of COVID-19 would help doctors provide a quick and confident diagnosis. As a result, patients could get the right treatment before the most severe effects of the virus take hold.\n\nCurrently, COVID-19 can be diagnosed via polymerase chain reaction to detect genetic material from the virus or chest radiograph. However, it can take a few hours and sometimes days before the molecular test results are back. By contrast, chest radiographs can be obtained in minutes. While guidelines exist to help radiologists differentiate COVID-19 from other types of infection, their assessments vary. In addition, non-radiologists could be supported with better localization of the disease, such as with a visual bounding box.\n\nIn this competition, the task is to identify and localize COVID-19 abnormalities on chest radiographs. In particular, categorization of the radiographs as negative for pneumonia or typical, indeterminate, or atypical for COVID-19.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#first we import some important libraries\nimport numpy as np #for using arrays and matrices\nimport pandas as pd #for converting files to dataframe format, opening for example \nimport matplotlib #for plotting graphs and tables\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pydicom as dicom # Dicom (Digital Imaging) \nimport os #allows us to use the operating system interation\nfrom tqdm import tqdm # allows you to output a smart progress bar by wrapping around any iterable","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-14T12:05:24.276853Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-14T12:05:24.277295Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-14T12:05:24.283156Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-14T12:05:24.27726Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-14T12:05:24.282099Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<font size=\"5\">Category of Radiographs </font>\n\n\n1.

But one study can contain multiple images (more info in the **STUDY DATA** section).  \n\nColumns 'boxes' and 'label' in train_image are somewhat redundant:\n* boxes contains location and size of the boxes\n* label contains location (xmin, ymin, xmax, ymax) of the boxes and confidence (which for the training data is always 1)\n\nSo we don't need 'boxes' column, we can just use the info from 'label' column.\n\n### The 'label' column in train_image data\nlabel column has a structure:  \na) for image with no boxes: `none 1 0 0 1 1`  \nb) for image with boxes: `opacity 1 <xmin> <ymin> <xmax> <ymax>`\n* if there is more than one box, there are multiple labels like this in a row, for example:  \n`opacity 1 789.29 582.43 1815.94 2499.73 opacity 1 2245.91 591.21 3340.57 2352.75`\n  \n\n### How should the submission file look like?\nFor images it is consistent with the label column!<br/>\na) for image with no boxes: `id_image,none 1 0 0 1 1`  \nb) for image with boxes: `id_image,opacity <confidence> <xmin> <ymin> <xmax> <ymax>`  \nAnd for studies: `id_study,<class> <confidence> 0 0 1 1`\n\nExample from the Kaggle Evaluation tab:\n```\nId,PredictionString\n2b95d54e4be65_study,negative 1 0 0 1 1\n2b95d54e4be66_study,typical 1 0 0 1 1\n2b95d54e4be67_study,indeterminate 1 0 0 1 1 atypical 1 0 0 1 1\n2b95d54e4be68_image,none 1 0 0 1 1\n2b95d54e4be69_image,opacity 0.5 100 100 200 200 opacity 0.7 10 10 20 20\n```\n\nAlso, if I understand correctly, every study in train and test data is assigned to exactly one class (the classes are mutually exclusive) and it's best if you predict that class. But if you are not sure about your prediction, you can also try multilabel classification, for example: `2b95d54e4be65_study,negative 0.7 0 0 1 1 indeterminate 0.6 0 0 1 1`.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Let's look at the data!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_image = pd.read_csv('../input/siim-covid19-detection/train_image_level.csv')\ntrain_study = pd.read_csv('../input/siim-covid19-detection/train_study_level.csv')\nprint('shape of train_image:', train_image.shape)\ntrain_image.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-09T15:34:37.502616Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-09T15:34:37.503033Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-09T15:34:37.564918Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-09T15:34:37.503001Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-09T15:34:37.563659Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print('shape of train_study:', train_study.shape)\ntrain_study.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-09T15:14:54.530332Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-09T15:14:54.53078Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-09T15:14:54.545026Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-09T15:14:54.530747Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-09T15:14:54.543605Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"TRAIN_DIR = '../input/siim-covid19-detection/train'\nTEST_DIR = '../input/siim-covid19-detection/test'","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-09T15:14:54.546873Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-09T15:14:54.547192Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-09T15:14:54.552778Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-09T15:14:54.547163Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-09T15:14:54.551411Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# IMAGE DATA\n\nThis is how you can get to an image:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# take first example and get path to it\nfrom os import walk, listdir\nimage_dir = train_image['StudyInstanceUID'][0]\npath_to_img = TRAIN_DIR + '/' + image_dir \npath_to_img = path_to_img +'/' + listdir(path_to_img)[0] \npath_to_img = path_to_img + '/' + next(walk(path_to_img))[2][0]","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-09T15:14:54.554245Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-09T15:14:54.55475Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-09T15:14:54.567846Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-09T15:14:54.554718Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-09T15:14:54.566718Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The image files are in DICOM (.dcm) format.

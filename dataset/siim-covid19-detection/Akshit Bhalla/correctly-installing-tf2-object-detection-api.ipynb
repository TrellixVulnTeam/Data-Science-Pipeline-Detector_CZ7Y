The installation that had worked for me about 5-6 months ago didn't seem to work this time. The TF2 OD API has been updated (to version 2.5) since then and the CUDA (v11.2) doesn't seem to be compatible with that offered by Kaggle (v11.0). After much exploration and deliberation I decided to create <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/questions-and-answers/253611\">this topic</a>.

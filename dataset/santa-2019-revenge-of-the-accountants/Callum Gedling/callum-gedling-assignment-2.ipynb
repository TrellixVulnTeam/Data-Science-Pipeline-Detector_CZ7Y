It is based on the divide-and-conquer paradigm, where the sequence is divided into subsequences, which are then recurred to sort each subsequence and then the subsequences are combined by a concatenation. Quicksort can sort items of any type for which a \"less-than\" relation is defined. The algorithm consists of the following three steps:\n1.\tDivide: Only done if the sequence has at least two elements, if the sequence has one or no elements nothing needs to be done. A specific element x from the sequence must be selected, which is called the pivot. Common practice is to select the pivot x to be the last element in the sequence. All of the elements must then be removed from the sequence and put into three sequences: \nL, storing the elements in the sequence less than x\nE, Storing the elements in the sequence equal to x\nG, storing the elements in the sequence greater than x \nIf the elements of the sequence are distinct, then E will only hold the pivot\n\n2.\tConquer: The sequences L and G are recursively sorted.\n3.\tCombine: Put the elements back into the sequence in order by first inserting the elements of L, then E and finally G\n\n**Boundary Cases**\nThe time taken by QuickSort can be written as:\nT(n) = T(k) + T(n-k-1) + O(n)\nWhere the first two terms are referring to the recursive calls. k = the number of elements smaller than the pivot.\n\n**Best Case:**\nThe best case occurs when the partition process picks the middle element as pivot.\nThe time can be written as T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)\nThis provides us a time complexity of O(nlogn)\n\n**Worst Case:**\nThis occurs when the partition picks the greatest or smallest element as a pivot.\nFor example, if the last element is always chosen as the pivot, the worst case would occur is the array is already sorted.\nThis can be written as T(n) = T(0) + T(n-1) + O(n)\nThis provides us a time complexity of O(n^2)\n\n**Average Case:**\nWe can get an idea of the average array by considering the case where the partition puts O(n/9) elements in a single set and O(9n/10) elements in other set.\nThis can be written as T(n) = T(n/9) + T(9n/10) + O(n)\nThis provides us a time complexity of O(nLogn)\n\nIn this case, the algorithm seems to be running in O(nLogn) time, as indicated by the graph. While the graph initially may look linear, there is a slight curvature around the 2000th iteration, which slightly resembles an O(nLogn) graph. If the algorithm took longer than 0.09 seconds this curvature would likely be more visible. \n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Reference: https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/python/python-data-types\n\nA sequence is an ordered collection of similar or different data types. Python has multiple built-in sequence data types, which are:\n\nString, List and Tuple. In the case of the quick-sort algorithm a list is used.

This algorithm works by sampling a small number of families. The families top-k choices are considered and the caresian product of those choices is found. This gives k^f possible changes that can be made to the current assignment. For each proposed change a new assignment is created by updating the current best assignment, if the new score is better than the current best score, both of the values will be updated. This is repeated by the number of iterations which is selected, given by the parameter n_iter. As the algorithm utilises a nested loop it’s worst case scenario will be a running time of O(n^2), however in the best case the algorithm will run in an O(n) time. The algorithm takes 219 seconds to run (note this time does varry slighlty each time I commit this code), although it is running 2000 times 219 / 2000 = 0.1095, meaning the algorithm is running on average at 0.1095 seconds, which indicates it is running in O(n) time. The time graph supports this, with a linear increase with respect to the number of iterations.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Matrix\n\nReference: https://www.careerride.com/Data-structure-matrix-and-its-uses.aspx\n\nA matrix is used to store data in an organized way in a rows and columns structure to persist homogeneous data.

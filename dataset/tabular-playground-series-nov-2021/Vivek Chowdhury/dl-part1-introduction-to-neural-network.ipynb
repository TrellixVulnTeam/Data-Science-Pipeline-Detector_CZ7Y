It seems only logical, then, to look at the brain's architecture for inspiration on how to build an intelligent machine. This is the logic that sparked <strong>Artificial Neural Networks (ANN):</strong> <mark>an ANN is a Machine Learning model inspired by the networks of biological neurons found in our brains.</mark> However, although planes were inspired by birds, they don't have to flap their wings. Similarly, ANNs have gradually become quite different from their biological cousins. Some researchers argue that we should drop the biological analogy altogether (e.g., by saying \"units\" rather than \"neurons\"), lest we restrict our creativity to biologically plausible systems.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size:120%\">ANNs are at the very core of Deep Learning. <mark>They are versatile, powerful and scalable, making them ideal to tackle large and highly complex Machine Learning tasks such as <strong>classifying billions of images(Google Images), powering speech recognition(Siri), recommending the best videos to watch to hundreds and millions of users(Youtube), or learning to beat the world champion at the game of Go(DeepMind's AlphaGo).</strong></mark></p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size:120%\">With that being said, let's have a look at the anatomy/structure of a biological neuron below.</p>\n\n<p style=\"font-size:120%\">Reference: <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/\" style=\"text-decoration:none\">Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition</a></p>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1 style=\"font-size:50px;color:#6166B3\"><strong>Biological </strong><strong style=\"color:black\">Neurons:</strong></h1>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![Neuron_Img](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/10/Blausen_0657_MultipolarNeuron.png)\n<p style=\"font-size:120%;text-align:center\">Figure 1: A Biological Neuron</p>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<p style=\"font-size:120%\">Neurons are information messengers. <mark>They use <strong>electrical impulses and chemical signals</strong> to transmit information between different areas of the brain</mark>, and between the brain and the rest of the nervous system.

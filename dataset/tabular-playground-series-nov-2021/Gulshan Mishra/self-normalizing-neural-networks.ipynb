This is because after a certain number of few layers, SGD becomes unstable and the network starts to encounter problems such as vanishing and exploding gradients. Moreover, SGD and regularization techniques like dropout often perturbs Batch Normalization leading to high variance in training error. These problems are solved by Self Normalizing Neural Networks.\n\nSelf-Normalizing Neural Networks (SNNs) are neural networks which automatically keep their activations at zero-mean and unit-variance (per neuron). This is accomplished through the use of SeLU activation function which requires LeCun Normal kernel initialization.\n\nFollowing is an excerpt from the [research paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02515.pdf) of Self Normalizing Neural Networks:\n\n> Self-normalizing neural networks (SNNs) are robust to perturbations and do not have high variance\nin their training errors. SNNs push neuron activations to zero mean and unit variance\nthereby leading to the same effect as batch normalization, which enables to robustly learn many\nlayers. SNNs are based on scaled exponential linear units “SELUs” which induce self-normalizing\nproperties like variance stabilization which in turn avoids exploding and vanishing gradients.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Code","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Some preprocessing","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-08T02:01:59.748949Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-08T02:01:59.749789Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-08T02:01:59.768118Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-08T02:01:59.749693Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-08T02:01:59.767458Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/tabular-playground-series-nov-2021/train.csv\")\ntest_df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/tabular-playground-series-nov-2021/test.csv\")\nsub_df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/tabular-playground-series-nov-2021/sample_submission.csv\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-08T02:02:00.268785Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-08T02:02:00.269062Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-08T02:02:27.622137Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-08T02:02:00.269031Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-08T02:02:27.621415Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Seperating features and targets","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-06T21:03:59.025049Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-06T21:03:59.025433Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-06T21:03:59.025211Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-06T21:03:59.025235Z"}}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_df.drop(columns=[\"id\"], inplace=True)\ntest_df.drop(columns=[\"id\"], inplace=True)\n\nX = train_df.drop(columns=[\"target\"]).values\ny = train_df[\"target\"].values","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-08T02:02:27.625631Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-08T02:02:27.625828Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-08T02:02:28.041068Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-08T02:02:27.625804Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-08T02:02:28.040172Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Building SNN Model","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Notice that, the **[LeCun Normal](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras/initializers/LecunNormal)** kernel initializer is used instead of the default one.

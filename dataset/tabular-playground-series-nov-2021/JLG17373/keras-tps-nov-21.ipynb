One aspect that often proves helpful to note is \"a large difference is more important than a small difference, (but it depends on the difference)\" - me. When data is not 'normalized', a large difference between two values of a feature may have more 'importance' than say a relatively small (but very important) difference for a model. A way to take this into account is to normalize the data. (Scale each feature such that every feature has the same 'spread' or 'min/max' etc.)\n\nKeras has a normlization layer that we will use.

There goes out hopes (but not our dreams). This heatmap confirms that the features do not correlate strongly with eachother. (Thus, 'feature engineering' may be of no help) BUT we can see that some do correlate \"more strongly\" with the `id` (leftmost column) and `target` (bottom row).\n\n*Note, the strengths of any correlations here are exceptionally weak if present at all. We will more than likely just skip this step altogether, but it's extra practice for myself*\n\nFortunately, we remove the `id` feature as it is just a label and the correlations present are 'false', they will only create misleading predictions.

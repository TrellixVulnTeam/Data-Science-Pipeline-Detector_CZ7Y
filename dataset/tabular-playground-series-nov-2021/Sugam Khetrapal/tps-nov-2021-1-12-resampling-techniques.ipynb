Please have a look at it.\n\n# Problem Statement\n\nIn this competition, we predict whether or not an email is spam.\n\nIt is a binary (2-class) classification problem. The number of observations for each class is balanced. There are 600,000 observations in the training dataset with 101 input variables (id and f0 to f99) and 1 output variable (target). We do not have any missing values.\n\n<u>Goal of the Competition</u>: The Goal of the Tabular Playground Series November 2021 is to predict whether or not an email is spam.\n\n<u>Goal of this Notebook</u>: In this notebook, we are going to prepare training dataset using the various resampling techniques such as KFold, StratifiedKFold and Repeated Random Splits.\n\nWe are going to cover the following steps:\n1. Load Data\n2. Resampling using KFold Cross Validation\n3. Resampling using StratifiedKFold\n4. Resampling using Repeated Random Splits\n5. Resampling using Leave One Out Cross Validation\n6.

It works by splitting the dataset into k-parts (e.g. k = 5 or k = 10). Each split of the data is called a fold. The algorithm is trained on kâˆ’1 folds with one held back and tested on the held back fold. This is repeated so that each fold of the dataset is given a chance to be the held back test set. After running cross validation we end up with k different performance scores that we can summarize using a mean and a standard deviation.\n\nThe result is a more reliable estimate of the performance of the algorithm on new data. It is more accurate because the algorithm is trained and evaluated multiple times on different data. The choice of k must allow the size of each test partition to be large enough to be a reasonable sample of the problem, whilst allowing enough repetitions of the train-test evaluation of the algorithm to provide a fair estimate of the algorithms performance on unseen data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.model_selection import KFold\n\ndef create_kfolds(data,

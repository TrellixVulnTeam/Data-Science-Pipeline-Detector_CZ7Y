I have also tried doing a very simple feature selection and applied that to some of those models.\n\nAlthough couple of those models gives good results, I have seen that many people are getting better results with deep learning. Hence, I have also started learning about it.\n\nSo, in this notebook, I will try what I have learned so far.

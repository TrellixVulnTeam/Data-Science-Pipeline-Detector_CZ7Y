Assuming our calculation is correct, this suggest there might be a weak feature dependence to the flip probability (as the chunks have different feature distributions). This could also be driven by something related to the process of chunking - for example each chunk might have a slightly different flip probability (but independent of the features).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Import libraries, load data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-19T02:58:53.542747Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-19T02:58:53.543173Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-19T02:58:53.547299Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-19T02:58:53.543134Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-19T02:58:53.546453Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Import competition train data, both after and before the reshuffling","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train = pd.read_csv('../input/tabular-playground-series-nov-2021/train.csv')\ntrain_old = pd.read_csv('../input/november21/train.csv')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-19T02:58:54.073862Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-19T02:58:54.074599Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-19T02:59:14.170432Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-19T02:58:54.07455Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-19T02:59:14.169266Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For convenience:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"y = train['target']\ny_old = train_old['target']","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-19T02:59:14.172076Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-19T02:59:14.172363Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-19T02:59:14.186151Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-19T02:59:14.172329Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-19T02:59:14.18528Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As discussed [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tabular-playground-series-nov-2021/discussion/286731) by [@grayjay](https://www.kaggle.com/grayjay), the training data seems to be a combination of ten chunks of size 60k, each with slightly different distributions.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"CS = 60000","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-19T02:59:14.187924Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-19T02:59:14.188415Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-19T02:59:14.199142Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-19T02:59:14.188353Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-19T02:59:14.198229Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Study random flips in the train set","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This is an array telling us which of the targets were flipped","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"is_flipped = (y != y_old)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-19T02:59:14.201116Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-19T02:59:14.201445Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-19T02:59:14.211372Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-19T02:59:14.20141Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-19T02:59:14.210564Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Calculate how many targets were flipped in each of the chunks","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"num_flipped = np.zeros(10, dtype = int)\nfor i in range(10):\n    num_flipped[i] = np.sum(is_flipped[i*CS:(i+1)*CS])\n    print(num_flipped[i])","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-19T02:59:14.212424Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-19T02:59:14.212947Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-19T02:59:14.229695Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-19T02:59:14.212914Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-19T02:59:14.228554Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Basic statistics","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"mu = np.mean(num_flipped)\nstd = np.std(num_flipped)\nprint(f'Mean is {mu:.0f} and standard deviation {std:.0f}')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-19T02:59:14.231022Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-19T02:59:14.231282Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-19T02:59:14.23943Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-19T02:59:14.231252Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-19T02:59:14.238534Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Parameters of the [binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution) and standard deviation we would expect if the flips were randomly drawn from this distribution","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"N = CS        # number of draws\np = mu/N      # success probability\nq = 1 -

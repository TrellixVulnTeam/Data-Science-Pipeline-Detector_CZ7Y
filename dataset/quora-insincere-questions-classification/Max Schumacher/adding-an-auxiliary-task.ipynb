The general idea is to leverage additional data / targets before or during your training. This is one of the reasons why BERT (the current state of the art) is so great:\n\n1. You can do the pretraining on a large corpus of unlabeled text\n2. With additional objectives they make sure the model generalizes well\n\nOf course, we've been doing something similar by using pretrained word embeddings, though nowhere near as cool as BERT does. Unfortunately, we don't have additional data sources in this competition, so can't exactly build much on 1. But is there a possibility to extend on 2? Can we add additional (auxiliary) objectives to our training?\n\nLet me give you some examples of what BERT tries to optimize in parallel and why this may help. For example, they don't just look at how words relate to each other, as is done in Word2Vec and friends. They also teach the model to decide whether two sentences follow each other in the text. Basically, they add this objective to the training: \"Hey BERT, given these two sentences, do you think they are following each other in real text, or not?\". This is a genius way to give the model some additional understanding of text, while keeping the problem relatively simple. It can't just stop at understanding how the single words interact. It also needs to grog to some extent what makes a text flow and what are some causal relationships across sentences. And it comes at no cost, since the data can be extracted from the text corpus in an unsupervised fashion.\n\nBtw, here's a great article on the matter of Multi-Task Learning in NLP by Sebastian Ruder: http://ruder.io/multi-task-learning-nlp/"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6026fd218267099c5fb55e712cd04667e5116c2c"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Our Auxiliary Task\n\nHow can we achieve something similar in this competition? Of course, we could try the sentence trick, but I assume most if not all questions only have a single sentence in their title. This may also lead to overfitting on the training set.\n\nSo, here's my idea: Sentiment is probably somehow correlated to insincerity, but not equivalent. We are allowed to use NLTK, and NLTK comes with a sentiment analysis tool. It's simple, but better than nothing. How about we analyze each sentence, get a sentiment score, and add that as a secondary target for our neural network to estimate?\n\nSo instead of asking this question \"Hey model, given this question, give me how insincere it is\" we ask: \"Hey model, given this question, tell me both how insincere it is and what the sentiment is like\".\n\nIf this works, this may have two effects:\n1. The model may learn **more general features**, reducing overfitting\n2. The model may receive **more information** relevant for the insincerity decision, increasing it's performance"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c9d2abe74ece202d48a8ba97f2503d9501491366"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# The Experiment\n\nTo explore the effect of this idea, we run three experiments using the same model architecture:\n\n1. **BASELINE**: Train on the sincerity target only\n2. **MULTI-TASK LEARNING**: Train on both targets at the same time\n3. **TRANSFER LEARNING**: Pretrain on sentiment, then fine-tune on insincerity\n\nWe compare their performance in terms of F1 on a hold-out validation set.\n\n**Note**: As we have all had to learn, the variance of outcomes is pretty high in this competition. That's why I ran each of the experiments several times and I encourage you to do the same.\n\nI've taken some of the standard boilerplate code from other kernels.

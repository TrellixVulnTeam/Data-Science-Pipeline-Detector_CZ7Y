The yellow regions help us see where the images are saturated better.\n\nAs a demonstration, this cell also shows the difference between `matplotlib`'s standard `imshow` function and `matshow`. You can see the latter gives a more granular, seemingly noisier display. This is present in the original data and somewhat hidden by `imshow` because interpolation is done automatically, so I believe using imshow gives a more \"real\" visualization of the data and its noise. You can also achieve the same visual effect by adding `interpolation='none'` when calling `imshow`.

The major difference is that all of the data is in the same archive file. As such, when loaded, the archive functions like a dictionary and is indexed by the keys we assigned above.\n\nAt this point, this may sound like a terrible thing to do, because during training and testing we shouldn't need to load every image at once. This would be very taxing on computers with less memory. We can get around this by using memory-mapping, conveniently handled for us by the NumPy `load` function. When reading in the archive, we supply the `mmap_mode='r'` keyword-argument. When this argument is specified, instead of reading the entire file into memory, the archive will be kept *on disk,* allowing us to access the chunks that we want (i.e. the individual images) without actually loading them all into memory at once.

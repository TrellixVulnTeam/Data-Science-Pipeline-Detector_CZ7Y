On top of that, we explored possible population differences between groups coming from or heading to the six planets at hand. We might want to consider the distance between origin and destination in the model according to what we saw with the cryosleep condition. And there is also a socio-economic pattern that affects the cabin deck where the passengers are staying and if they are in cryosleep, and therefore, can have an impact on the possibility of being transported. \n\nIf you've reached this point I just want to thank you for reading and hope this can be of help for your models!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}

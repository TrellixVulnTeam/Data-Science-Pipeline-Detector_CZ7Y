Question or problem definition.\n2. Acquire training and testing data.\n3. Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.\n4. Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.\n5. Model, predict and solve the problem.\n6. Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.\n7. Supply or submit the results.\n\nThe workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.\n\n- We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.\n- Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.\n- Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.\n- Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.\n\n\n# Question and problem definition\n\nCompetition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition To help rescue crews and retrieve the lost passengers, you are challenged to predict which passengers were transported by the anomaly using records recovered from the spaceshipâ€™s damaged computer system., competition is [described here at Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic).\n\n> Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who Transported or did not the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset Transported or not.\n\nWe may also needs to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the [Kaggle competition description page here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic). \n\n# Workflow goals\n\nThe data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.\n\n**Classifying.** We may needs to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.\n\n**Correlating.** One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a [correlation](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Correlation) among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.\n\n**Converting.** For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.\n\n**Completing.** Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.\n\n**Correcting.** We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.\n\n**Creating.** Can might create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.\n\n**Charting.** How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# data analysis and wrangling\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport random as rnd\n\n# visualization\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\n# machine learning\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression\nfrom sklearn.svm import SVC, LinearSVC\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\nfrom sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import Perceptron\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import SGDClassifier\nfrom sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-11T18:07:01.907149Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-11T18:07:01.907442Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-11T18:07:03.468874Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-11T18:07:01.907412Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-11T18:07:03.467971Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Acquire data\n\nThe Python Pandas packages helps us work with our datasets.

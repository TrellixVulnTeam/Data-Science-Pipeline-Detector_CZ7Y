We either need to impute these or use a model which has support for automatically imputing them (like XGBoost).\n- Not all features will be equally helpful when used as candidates for using presence of missing values as features.\n- The variables are not strongly correlated, which possibly means that a good model with proper hyperparameters is likely to generalize well.\n- Features like `GroupId` and `CabinId` can't really be judged using visualization due to their dense nature. We need to train models with and without these features to see their usefulness.\n- There are still other features that can be engineered. For example, the surnames can be extracted from the given names, the gender can be guessed using the names, families can be grouped according to surnames, etc.\n\nThank you for reading!","metadata":{}}]}

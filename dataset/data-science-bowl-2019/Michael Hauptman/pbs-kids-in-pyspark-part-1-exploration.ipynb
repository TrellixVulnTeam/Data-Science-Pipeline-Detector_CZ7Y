Using PySpark for exploration on a training dataset of only 4 Gb is a case of overkill:  big data tools are typlically used where the dataset won't fit in RAM,otherwise the parallelisation overhead will generally make things slower than single machine toolsets like scitkitlearn.  And due to Spark's 'lazy evaluation\" method it's certainly the wrong tool for the job for data exploration where lots of different metrics are required of a dataset.   But it was an opportunity to consolidate skills from the edX subject I've just completed \"Big Data Analytics using Spark\"  https://courses.edx.org/courses/course-v1:UCSanDiegoX+DSE230x+3T2019/course/.   I don't expect to achieve any great leaderboard result or push the boundaries of machine learning alorithims, rather to practise my PySpark skills."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**You should run this notebook on a local machine** - Kaggle only provides 4.9G of scratch memory, too small for Pyspark as it tends to chew through memory, espcially when doing 'windows' functions.  I've had to use normal Pandas dataframes for the visualisation part of the notebook so it will run on Kaggle.\n\nWorth noting  that the PBS competion doesn't allow kernels with internet access, and hence pyspark.  But you could run Pyspark offline and pickle the resulting models for use in the competition kernels.  \n\nThis notebook covers initial exploration, and I'll post others on feature engineering and on modelling.  I've based the analysis on the popular kernel \"Data Science Bowl 2019 data exploration\"  https://www.kaggle.com/erikbruin/data-science-bowl-2019-data-exploration by Erkin Bruin https://www.kaggle.com/erikbruin.  I've run the results on mt laptop in both Erkin's sensible single machine approach and in Pyspark, both to ensure accurancy and compare run-times.

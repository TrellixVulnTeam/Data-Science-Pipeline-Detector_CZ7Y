In the fifth Data Science Bowl, we have the opportunity to look into early childhood education, and the role of digital media in unlocking a child's potentials! A very interesting topic, as a lot of parents I know have a pre-conception that their child's future is rather being ruined by mobile phones and digital media. \n\nIn this competition, we have a data of kids playing a game app with five main challenges or assessments. Before each challenge, there are fun activities, games, and video clips. The attempts made to complete the challenge is the label in our dataset. Our job is to build a model to predict how many attempts it will take for a child to complete the challenge.

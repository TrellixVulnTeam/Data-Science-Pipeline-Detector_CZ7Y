Event data is identified trhough event-title combinations coded in `event_id`.\n* The first `event_code` in a `game_session` is always **2000** and the last event varies.\n* Assessments have the `event_codes` **4110** or **4100** and these map to `installation_ids` and `game_sessions` in **train_labels** data\n* The last event having an assesment (ordered by `timestamp` or `event_count`) is always the one for which a label exists.

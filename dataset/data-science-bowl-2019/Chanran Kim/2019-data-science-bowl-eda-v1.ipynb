[National Data Science Bowl](https://www.kaggle.com/c/datasciencebowl/overview)\n    - For measuring and monitoring plankton populations\n2. [Second Annual Data Science Bowl](https://www\".kaggle.com/c/second-annual-data-science-bowl)\n    - To automatically determine cardiac volumes from MRI scans (Diagnosing Heart Diseases)\n3. [Data Science Bowl 2017](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2017)\n    - To detect lung cancer\n4. [2018 Data Science Bowl](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018)\n    - To automate nucleus detection.\n       \nThe Data Science Bowl is the worldâ€™s premier data science for social good competition, created in 2014 and presented by Booz Allen Hamilton and Kaggle. <br/>\nThere is an official website. https://datasciencebowl.com/ <br/>\n    \n### And, the 2019 Data science Bowl is fifth! :)\n- predict scores on in-game assessments and create an algorithm that will lead to better-designed games and improved learning outcomes.\n- aid in discovering important relationships between engagement with high-quality educational media and learning processes.\n- use anonymous gameplay data(including knowledge of videos watched and games played)\n\n### The outcomes in this competition are grouped into 4 groups (labeled accuracy_group in the data):\n- 3: the assessment was solved on the first attempt\n- 2: the assessment was solved on the second attempt\n- 1: the assessment was solved after 3 or more attempts\n- 0: the assessment was never solved"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data Desciption\n\n### train.csv & test.csv\nThese are the main data files which contain the gameplay events.\n- event_id - Randomly generated unique identifier for the event type. Maps to event_id column in specs table.\n- game_session - Randomly generated unique identifier grouping events within a single game or video play session.\n- timestamp - Client-generated datetime\n- event_data - Semi-structured JSON formatted string containing the events parameters. Default fields are: event_count, event_code, and game_time; otherwise fields are determined by the event type.\n- installation_id - Randomly generated unique identifier grouping game sessions within a single installed application instance.\n- event_count - Incremental counter of events within a game session (offset at 1). Extracted from event_data.\n- event_code - Identifier of the event 'class'. Unique per game, but may be duplicated across games. E.g. event code '2000' always identifies the 'Start Game' event for all games. Extracted from event_data.\n- game_time - Time in milliseconds since the start of the game session. Extracted from event_data.\n- title - Title of the game or video.\n- type - Media type of the game or video. Possible values are: 'Game', 'Assessment', 'Activity', 'Clip'.\n- world - The section of the application the game or video belongs to. Helpful to identify the educational curriculum goals of the media. Possible values are: 'NONE' (at the app's start screen), TREETOPCITY' (Length/Height), 'MAGMAPEAK' (Capacity/Displacement), 'CRYSTALCAVES' (Weight).\n\n### specs.csv\nThis file gives the specification of the various event types.\n- event_id - Global unique identifier for the event type.

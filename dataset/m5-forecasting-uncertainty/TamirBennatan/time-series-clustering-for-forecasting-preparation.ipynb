{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Time Series Clustering For Forecasting Preparation\n\nThe M5 dataset is a set of time series of daily sales by item Categories, Departments, Stores, and Items. These levels of granularity have a heirarchical structure, in that: \n- A `Category` has multiple `Departments`\n- A `Department` spans across multiple `Stores`\n- A `Department` contains multiple `Items`\n- A combination of `Item` and `Store` is a the most granular level of series (SKU). \n\nUnlike more vanilla time series forecasting tasks - where one uses a single series to predict the future of the series, this structure allows for transfer learning between series. \n\nFor example: It may be that a group of items have similar sales patterns, due to seasonality in demand or supply, etc. Thus, it would make sense for a model to learn learn shared patterns to provide more robust forecasts. \n\nOn the other hand, demand for groups of items might differ substancially due to external forces. Training a model to try and find similarities between these groups might only introduce noise - as the demand/supply for these items are structurally different.\n\n### Clustering series\n\nThe purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate how we might group items that have similar underlying structure before diving into modeling using several clustering approaches. This way, we could pre-process series within groups in a similar way, and train a model for each cluster which specializes in learning this underlying structure. \n\nIn this notebook I'll use a naive heirarchical method to cluster the series, point out the shortcoming of this approach, and speak about a method to approach these shortcomings called Dynamic Time Warping."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Load packages and data"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# will need this later for dynamic time warping\n!pip install dtw-python","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd \nfrom random import sample\nimport random\nimport itertools\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n# dynamic time warping\nfrom dtw import *","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Sales data only\n\nFor this notebook, I'll only use `sales_train_validation.csv` dataset, which includes daily sales at an item, store, department and category level.

For example: instead of training a model on the entire dataset, it may make sense to train one model per cluster, as the underlying structure of the series' are similar within a cluster. Or, one could pre-process (scaling, clipping) the series within a cluster in a similar way.

The accuracy of your model on the test set is only ever checked after you've completed your entire training process, including trying different models, training methods, data processing, etc.\n\nYou see, as you try all these different things, to see their impact on the metrics on the validation set, you might just accidentally find a few things that entirely coincidentally improve your validation set metrics, but aren't really better in practice.

But don't check too often, or you'll be even over-fitting to the test set!\n\nKaggle has a second test set, which is yet another held-out dataset that's only used at the end of the competition to assess your predictions.

These are the measurements that should, hopefully, represent how well our model will works for us.\n\nIn real life, outside of Kaggle, things not easy... As my partner Dr Rachel Thomas notes in The problem with metrics is a big problem for AI:\n\nAt their heart, what most current AI approaches do is to optimize metrics. The practice of optimizing metrics is not new nor unique to AI, yet AI can be particularly efficient (even too efficient!) at doing so. This is important to understand, because any risks of optimizing metrics are heightened by AI. While metrics can be useful in their proper place, there are harms when they are unthinkingly applied. Some of the scariest instances of algorithms run amok all result from over-emphasizing metrics. We have to understand this dynamic in order to understand the urgent risks we are facing due to misuse of AI.\n\nIn Kaggle, however, it's very straightforward to know what metric to use: Kaggle will tell you! According to this competition's evaluation page, \"submissions are evaluated on the Pearson correlation coefficient between the predicted and actual similarity scores.\" This coefficient is usually abbreviated using the single letter r. It is the most widely used measure of the degree of relationship between two variables.\n\nr can vary between -1, which means perfect inverse correlation, and +1, which means perfect positive correlation. The mathematical formula for it is much less important than getting a good intuition for what the different values look like. To start to get that intuition, let's look at some examples using the California Housing dataset, which shows \"is the median house value for California districts, expressed in hundreds of thousands of dollars\".

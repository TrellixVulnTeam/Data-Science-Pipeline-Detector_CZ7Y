To find out, open a kaggle notebook and click Add Data: Search Datasets: and enter the name of the library.  For example, searching for sentence-transformers shows a github repo uploaded about a year ago.  If you find your library as a dataset, go to part 1 below.\n\n* Is the package not uploaded as a kaggle dataset?

You can't do everything in kaggle-- you'll need to go into terminal to download the packages you need.\n\n1. Create a folder where you will put the packages that you download.

Type in the command: !pip download [package name]. Note-- you're not using pip install, like we usually do.  You're using pip download instead.

There's probably one named for the package you were installing.\n\n5. Open a kaggle notebook.  On the right-hand side of the notebook, add the file you just downloaded as a new dataset.

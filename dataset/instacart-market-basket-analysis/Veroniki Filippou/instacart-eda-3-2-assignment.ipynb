Create a DataFrame that contains information for both the orders & order_products_prior DataFrame. Use a inner join and save it as **prd** DataFrame.\n\n### Question 2: Get the average days since a prior order for each user.\n1. Get the average days since a prior order for each user.  You will need to use the prd DataFrame , .groupby( ) method & the appropriate aggregation function. Save the results as **avg_days** and name the column as **'days_order_mean’**\n2. Create a histrogram for **'days_order_mean'** of **avg_days**. Use arguments: bins=100.\n\n### Question 3: How often does a customer reorder products (reorder ratio of a customer)\n1. Get the total purchased products of each customer. Save the results as a DataFrame with name **reorders** and name the column as **'total_bought’**\n2. For each user, get the distinct number of its purchased products (no reordered products - only products purchased for first time). Save the column as **\"total_unique_bought\"** on **reorders** DataFrame.\n> Hint: Use prd[prd.reordered==0] to perform a .groupby( ) on\n3. Create a ratio of **total_unique_bought**/**total_bought**. Save the column as **'reorder_ratio'** on **reorders** DataFrame.\n4. Create a histrogram for **'reorder_ratio'** of **reorders**. Use arguments: bins=100\n5. Sort the rows of  **reorders**  in order to get first the customers with the lowest **'reorder_ratio'**. Keep the results with the same name (**reorders**).\n6. Save the index of the customer with the lowest ratio on a new variable. Name it as **low_ratio_customer**. You will use this index (user_id) on the next step.\n7. Now use the **low_ratio_customer** to get from **prd** all of its orders and products purchased. Store the results on **user_low**.\n8. Perform an appropriate join of **user_low** with **products** so you can get the name of products. Save the results on **user_low** .\n9. Get the name of the products that the user has bought. Select the column **'product_name'** of **user_low**  DataFrame and use an appropriate method to get the distinct values of the column."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"76ca5cf77d2cef05905ebadabe1ee9f6bdda64fc"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Question 1: Create a DataFrame that has the orders and the products purchased"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"dc9fbda3f64c592f5f0d40240fdd41d9fc24bdc8"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Write your answer here\n#Create a DataFrame that has the orders and the products purchased \nprd = pd.merge(orders, order_products_prior, on='order_id', how='inner')\nprd.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"c58a0d0ccf3c4b508b93b5a45fec4931792d659b"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Question 2: Get the average days since a prior order for each user.\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"91322e9d2b42af53eedd508c4d2ffe888e744f11"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Write your answer here\n#Getting the average days since a prior order for each user.\navg_days=prd.groupby('user_id')[['days_since_prior_order']].mean()\navg_days.columns=['days_order_mean']\navg_days.head()\n\n#Creating a histrogram for **'days_order_mean'** of **avg_days**.\nplt.hist(avg_days.days_order_mean,bins=100)\nplt.show()\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"d4df1ae162f35b699820ee6681947c37f9a6494a"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Question 3: How often does a customer reorder products (reorder ratio of a customer)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"1e45e54a52d2a8fb0f06fac8e16aeecfc3d519a1"},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Write your answer here\n#Getting the total purchased products of each customer. \nreorders=prd.groupby('user_id')[['product_id']].count()\nreorders.columns=['total_bought']\n\n#For each user, getting the distinct number of its purchased products\nreorders['total_unique_bought']= prd[prd.reordered==0].groupby('user_id')[['product_id']].count()\nreorders.head()\n\n# Creating a ratio of **total_unique_bought**/**total_bought**.\nreorders['reorder_ratio']=reorders['total_unique_bought']/reorders['total_bought']\nreorders.head()\n\n# Creating a histrogram for **'reorder_ratio'** of **reorders**.\nplt.hist(reorders.reorder_ratio,bins=100)\nplt.show()\n\n#Sorting the rows of  **reorders**  in order to get first the customers with the lowest **'reorder_ratio'**. \nreorders=reorders.sort_values('reorder_ratio',ascending=True)\nreorders.head()\n\n#Saving the index of the customer with the lowest ratio\nlow_ratio_customer=reorders.index[0]\n\n# Use the **low_ratio_customer** to get from **prd** all of its orders and products purchased\nuser_low=prd[prd.user_id==low_ratio_customer][['order_id','product_id']]\nuser_low.head()\n\n#Joinning of **user_low** with **products** so you can get the name of products.\nproducts.head()\nuser_low=pd.merge(user_low,products,on='product_id',how='left')\nuser_low.head()\n\n# Getting the name of the products that the customer with lowest ratio has bought.\nuser_low.product_name.unique()\n\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

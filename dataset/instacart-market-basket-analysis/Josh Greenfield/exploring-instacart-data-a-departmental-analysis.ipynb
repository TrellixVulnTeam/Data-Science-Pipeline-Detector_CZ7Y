This could explain the relative maximum reorder rate of the baby department between the 4-6 day period.\n\nI want to be able to say the following:\n\n - This frequent reorder rate in the 0-3 day range suggests that products from the alcohol department are consumed on \n a more regular basis than any of the other products from other departments within this time range\n\n**Or**\n\n - This graph shows that out of all departments, alcohol products are the most frequently reordered within 3 days of their prior order relative to other departments\n\nHowever, I'm a little weary because of \"days_since_prior_order\" applies to orders and not products.  If anyone has a better way to explain this or a better way to do this I'd love to know!\n\n**Update**\n\n- Great comment from AlphaMeow concerning how to define **days_since_prior_order** that states:\n\n \"Basically I grouped on users then products, worked out the time duration (cummulated days_since_prior_order?) that this person keeps purchases the item, say, banana, and how many banana purchases he made during this time. Then I averaged on all person purchases banana, to get a general banana purchase frequency.\"\n\nGrouping by users first would be the right way to organize the data to gain insights from **days_since_prior_order** since what this column represents is more user-focused and not product-focused.\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"77d911a2-dc6e-903c-c9e5-5d7343456303","_uuid":"a8115236d02cd3f24336bfcb945ebcd263854a11"},"outputs":[],"cell_type":"markdown","execution_count":null,"source":"And that is it!

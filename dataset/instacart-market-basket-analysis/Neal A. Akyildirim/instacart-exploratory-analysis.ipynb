The company has dedicated employees who shop groceries from the selected stores and deliver to consumers' doorsteps. The way the company generates revenue is by adding markup on prices for specific stores, delivery and membership fee. Hence, the main business objective for the organization is to not only increase the amount of customer memberships but also improve the repeat visit and orders. Predicting consumer engagement and behavior with the products and grocery stores have a huge impact on instacart's success.\n\nThe main purpose of this analysis is to perform an explotary analysis and formulate incremental business problems to increase revenue. In order to do that, we will rely on historical data provided by Instacart. The further information about this publicly released dataset can be found here: https://tech.instacart.com/3-million-instacart-orders-open-sourced-d40d29ead6f2 "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## About the Data\n\nThe dataset is provided by instacart for a Kaggle Competition which are relational set of files describing costumers' orders over time. The dataset is anaymized and contains a sample of over 3 million grocery orders from more than 200,000 instacart users. For each user, the dataset provides between 4 and 100 of their orders, with the sequence of products purcahsed in each order. The dataset also provides the week and hour of day the order was placed, and relative measure of time between orders. \n\nThe description of each variable is outlined as below;\n\n**orders dataset**\n\n*order_id: order identifier*\n\n*user_id: customer identifier*\n\n*eval_set: which evaluation set this order belongs in (see train and prior dataset described below)*\n\n*order_number: the order sequence number for this user (1 = first, n = nth)*\n\n*order_dow: the day of the week the order was placed on*\n\n*order_hour_of_day: the hour of the day the order was placed on*\n\n*days_since_prior: days since the last order, capped at 30 (with NAs for order_number = 1)*\n\n**products dataset**\n\n*product_id: product identifier*\n\n*product_name: name of the product*\n\n*aisle_id: foreign key*\n\n*department_id: foreign key*\n\n**aisles dataset**\n\n*aisle_id: aisle identifier*\n\n*aisle: the name of the aisle*\n\n**deptartments dataset**\n\n*department_id: department identifier*\n\n*department: the name of the department*\n\n**order_products_prior and train datasets**\n\n*order_id: foreign key*\n\n*product_id: foreign key*\n\n*add_to_cart_order: order in which each product was added to cart*\n\n*reordered: 1 if this product has been ordered by this user in the past, 0 otherwise*\n\n\n*\"prior\": orders prior to that users most recent order*\n\n*\"train\": training data supplied to participants of the competion*\n\n*\"test\": test data reserved for machine learning competition*"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Collection and Cleaning\n\nIdeally, prior to the data collection phase, we would have liked to define the data requirements based on problem statement in order to collect the needed data.

However, we might run into situations where the domain expert, brand owner, business unit or stakeholder may not neccessarily know or does not have the time to figure out what the business problem is. In most of these cases, they are looking at the product manager to identify, formulate the business problems and provide tangible recommendations to solve them. \n\nIn our instacart analysis, we can summarize possible business problems that might have impact on revenue are;\n\n- Frequency of customer orders are low ranging from 4-12. What actions can business take in order the improve the frequncy of customer orders? \n\n- Majority of the customers planning their purchases as weekly and monthly cycles. What actions can business take to improve the purchases for any day of the week and month? As an example; Amazon made their entire ordering product and process very seamlessly that I personaly do not do extensive planning on my grocessory purchases. If I am in need of a product from amazon, I order that day. \n\n- Besides banana, top items are sold mostly on Monday and Tuesday. Can this be related to an item inventory issue from the retailers? For example; would it be possible Trader Joe's runs out of organic strawberries by Wednesday and instacart employee substitutes that order with a regular strawbery based on customer request?\n\n- Besides the general consumer and market needs, are there any reaons why certain department sales are lower than the others? (such as instacart website or mobileapp usability issues) \n\nFormulating and defining business problem statements is extremly important to find the right solution for the business goals. In my earlier article on linear regression, I mentioned how problematic it is for some statisticians to start with data analysis without creating a problem statement, however there are many cases where stakeholders expect data to drive and formulate a problem.

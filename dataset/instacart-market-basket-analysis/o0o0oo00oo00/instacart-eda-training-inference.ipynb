Fugue SQL is mostly standard SQL but with enhanced syntax to let you do more with less code.\n\nWe are not competing with other solutions, we only provide general ideas of what should be done and can be done for a scalable ML pipeline.\n\n\n## Links \n\nFugue is a pure abstraction layer that makes code portable across differing computing frameworks such as Pandas, Spark and Dask.

Examples of values that might be represented in a categorical variable: \n*  The blood type of a person: A, B, AB or O.  \n*  The state that a person lives in\n*  The political party that a voter might vote for.  \n> <p style='text-align: center;'> *\"Categorical Variables\" retrieved from WikiPedia.* </p> \n\nIn our case \"order_hour_of_day\" is indeed a categorical data ; it can take values from 0 to 23.\n\n2.

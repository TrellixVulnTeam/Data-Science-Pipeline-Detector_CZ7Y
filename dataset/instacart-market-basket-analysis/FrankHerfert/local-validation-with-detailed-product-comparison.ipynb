The prior data is organized in a \"continous\" way and later orders depend on previous ones. Unlike other classifacation problems you shouldn't split the orders in a typical 5-fold-Cross-Validation because it doesn't helpt to predict earlier orders using data from later orders.\n\nFortunately, Instacart has already provided us with the last orders for some client in the \"order_products_train.csv\" file. The naming of the files could be a bit better in my opinion as you dont just train your model on this file but also/only on the priors file.\n\nYou can use the train-data as your local test set if you format it in a different way."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"787937c0-fd2b-44c3-5a5f-8746d807b288"},"outputs":[],"source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\npd.set_option(\"display.max_colwidth\", 200) # use this to display more content for each column"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"1aa7e340-d1aa-cc52-5a40-65817dafaa34"},"outputs":[],"source":"train_df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/order_products__train.csv\")"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3ea0bad4-361c-be20-ddc2-5fa5a357082c"},"source":"## Formatting the training-data\n\nAs noted above, you should use the later orders for validating your model.

For more information on the F1-score, check [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F1_score) or [this article](http://machinelearningmastery.com/classification-accuracy-is-not-enough-more-performance-measures-you-can-use/).\n\nFor this we need to get the [precision and recall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall) for each row. These can be a bit confusing though at first.\n\n- precision (also called positive predictive value) is the fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances\n- recall (also known as sensitivity) is the fraction of relevant instances that have been retrieved over total relevant instances\n\nThe F1-Score combines these two and gives a good score if you predict the right instances and the right amount of instances. \n\n**Example**\n\nLet's say a customer actually bought 10 products (IDs are 0-9). Our model predicts 5 products (IDs 7, 8, 9, 10, 11) out of which 3 are correct (IDs 7, 8, 9) and 2 are incorrect.\n\n- precision is 3/5\n- recall is 3/10\n\nInstead of just rating your prediction on how many correct products you got, the F1-Score is penalizing predictions with too many false positives. Suppose we had 100 products in the whole inventory and we predicted that each customer bought all 100 of them, we would predict all the actually bought products but all the additional false positives would keep the score down."},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"7d736f56-21fb-4819-37d4-7a82512d21c8"},"source":"### Comparing local test-data and prediction-data\n\nFor the ease of demonstration, lets create two DataFrames with easy to use product_ids.

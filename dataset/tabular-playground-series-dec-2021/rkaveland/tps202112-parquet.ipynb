But there's a way to do that, without having to copy a function around all the time.\n\nApache Parquet\n--\n\nIs an open standard for an efficient binary file format for columnar data. It's supported by most tools that work with \"big\" tabular data, for example pandas, spark, polars, arrow. We use this at work, it scales very nicely up to \"billions of things\".\n\nIn general, if you `df.to_parquet(...)` a `DataFrame`, and later, you `pd.read_parquet(...)` the same one, all the columns will have the same dtype! To some extent, this works across languages an tools too -- if you've turned something into a `pd.CategoricalDtype` with `pandas`, chances are good that `polars`, which also supports such a concept, will read it back that way.

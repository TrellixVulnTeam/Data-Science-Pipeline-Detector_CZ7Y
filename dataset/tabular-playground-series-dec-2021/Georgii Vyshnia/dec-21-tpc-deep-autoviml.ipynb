Such an accuracy is extremely good for the real-world ML classification projects (sometimes they are released even if 70% of accuracy is achieved, depending on the missclassification tall and impact for a particular business problem).\n\n**Speed of model training and time to market under affordable resource allocation**. Model training time was less than 30 min (both on Kaggle premise and a local laptop). There was no need to set up any expensive hardware or cloud-based clusters to train the model.\n\nSurely, such a result is still behind certain manually tuned models.\n\nHowever, it demontrates that **Deep AutoViML** can deliver the models of real-world quality without  spending too much time and resource on its setup and training (as we know, in business enviroments, delivering good-enough results at a very fast timeline is often better then delivering the result of exceptional quality under very long timeline).","metadata":{}}]}

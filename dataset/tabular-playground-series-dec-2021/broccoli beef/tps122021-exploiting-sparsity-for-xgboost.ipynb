This dataset is a synthetic version of the well-known [forest covertype dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/covertype). In the original dataset, soil type features and wilderness area features are one-hot encoded, i.e., they are one-hot encoded binary features from categorical variables `Soil_Type` and `Wilderness_Area`. In the synthetic version, one-hotness has been lost. Nevertheless, they are still relatively sparse. Can we still exploit the sparsity to benefit classifier training, especially for tree-based classifiers?

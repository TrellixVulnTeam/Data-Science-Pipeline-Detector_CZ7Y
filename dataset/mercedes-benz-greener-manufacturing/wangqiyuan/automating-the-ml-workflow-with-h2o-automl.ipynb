{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Automated machine learning** (**AutoML**) is the process of automating the end-to-end process of applying machine learning to real-world problems. AutoML makes machine learning available in a true sense, even to people with no major expertise in this field.\n\n# Advantages\n\nThe advantages of AutoML can be summed up in three major points:\n\n-   **Increases productivity**  by automating repetitive tasks. This enables a  data scientist to focus more on the problem rather than the models.\n-   Automating the ML pipeline also helps to  **avoid errors** that might creep in manually.\n-   Ultimately,  AutoML is a step towards **democratizing machine learning** by making the power of ML accessible to everybody.\n\n# [H2O AutoML](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/automl.html)\nH2O’s AutoML can be used for automating the machine learning workflow, which includes automatic training and tuning of many models within a user-specified time-limit. [Stacked Ensembles](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/data-science/stacked-ensembles.html) – one based on all previously trained models, another one on the best model of each family – will be automatically trained on collections of individual models to produce highly predictive ensemble models which, in most cases, will be the top performing models in the AutoML Leaderboard.\n\nProperties of H2O AutoML\n\n* Basic data pre-processing (as in all H2O algos).\n\n* Trains a random grid of GBMs, DNNs, GLMs, etc. using a carefully chosen hyper-parameter space.\n\n* Individual models are tuned using cross-validation.\n\n* Two Stacked Ensembles are trained (“All Models” ensemble & a lightweight “Best of Family” ensemble).\n\n* Returns a sorted “Leaderboard” of all models. All models can be easily exported to production.\n\n\n# Objective\n\nOur job is to predict how long a car on a production line will take to pass the testing phase. This is a classical regression problem, and we're evaluated with the R2 metric.\n"},{"metadata":{"id":"KGDz27s_i4wu","colab_type":"code","colab":{},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\n\npal = sns.color_palette()\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Start H2O\nImport the h2o Python module and H2OAutoML class and initialize a local H2O cluster"},{"metadata":{"id":"pM33wQkLjmkV","colab_type":"code","outputId":"0cfffb08-338e-4d41-feb9-b9e2e96e8aa4","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":817},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import h2o\nprint(h2o.__version__)\nfrom h2o.automl import H2OAutoML\n\nh2o.init(max_mem_size='16G')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Load data into H2O"},{"metadata":{"id":"lViWtjfrlmw4","colab_type":"code","outputId":"f6506518-2dca-4b20-e347-c91acd32c5e9","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":85},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\ntrain = h2o.import_file(\"../input/mercedes-benz-greener-manufacturing/train.csv\")\ntest = h2o.import_file(\"../input/mercedes-benz-greener-manufacturing/test.csv\")\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's take a look at the data."},{"metadata":{"id":"fXWqRnpum7KH","colab_type":"code","outputId":"bdbc9e47-00dd-4781-e998-1d7ae54f4d57","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":165},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.head(5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"oLFYyFy6m-Zl","colab_type":"code","outputId":"3e1031a2-b352-42c6-dd20-69728a8604ed","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(f'Size of training set: {train.shape[0]} rows and {train.shape[1]} columns')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Next, let's identify the response column and save the column name as y.

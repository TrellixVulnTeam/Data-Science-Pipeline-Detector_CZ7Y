The submission deadline for this contest is notourious for creeping up on the contestents, which happened to me last year when I missed the deadline and was not able to submit my predictions. One other important note about this competition is that this is not like the usaual March Madness brackets going around work where you pick your winners for each round, since you are providing the likelyhood of Team 1 winning for every possible match up if the team you pick looses you are stil in the game.  Also, since this is log loss, if you use 0 or 1 for one of you predictions and are wrong, your loss will go to infinity. \n\n# 2 Libraries\nKaggle starts you off with the numpy, pandas and os librarys for this kernal. I will also be using matplotlib and seaborn for plotting; sklearn functions for data processing and xgboost for the model. These are all pretty standard librarys for kaggle competitions, so nothing exiting here.\n\n<img src=\"https://goo.gl/images/GNCCmP\">"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport os\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import log_loss\nimport warnings\nfrom xgboost import XGBClassifier\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"ccedabf21c8aa90775f28fb0a4dee5c5fb6e9783"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 3 Data Exploration\nWow, there are a lot of files available for this contest.

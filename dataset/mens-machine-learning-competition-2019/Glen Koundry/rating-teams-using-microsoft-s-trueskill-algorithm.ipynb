It is basically a probabalistic algorithm based on the *Elo* algorithm used to rank chess players.  It can be used to rank players in any activity where there is some concept of win/lose/draw.  The algorithm itself is somewhat hard to understand but fortunately someone has created a Python package which makes it easy to use without understanding the theory behind it.

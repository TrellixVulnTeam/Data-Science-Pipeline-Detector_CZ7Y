Each row contains the winning team ID and the lossing team ID, followed by the winning teams stats and the losing teams stats for that game. Since the data was collected in each row and seperated into columns, it was slightly difficult to sum all the data. <br>\n<br>\nFirst I had aggregated the winning and losing columns seperately into two dataframe \"WTeam_ID_mean\" and \"LTeam_ID_mean\" which contained the season, team_ID, and the mean statistics for the respective columns. I also count the number of wins and losses for each team so that I will be able to calculate the weighted arithmetic mean for each statistic.<br>\n<br>\nI renamed the columns for each dataframe so that they could be manipulated.

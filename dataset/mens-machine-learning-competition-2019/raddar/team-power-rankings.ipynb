However, this may be not the best approach, as human opinions tend to be biased towards their favorites. Moreover, it may be easy to determine a top few strong teams, but it is a much harder to rank teams in the mid-lower range ranks.\n\nIn NCAA tournament teams are assigned with tournament starting seeds, which also has expert bias - it is not uncommon, that a team with higher win ratio % would get lower seed compared to a team with lower win ratio %, based on the regular season schedule (which is not the same for every team!). Therefore, the judgment of team strength of assigned seed sometimes get controversial opinion among fans and media!\n\nThe idea of this kernel is to try to calculate the team strength rankings only based on the  data we have in our disposal.

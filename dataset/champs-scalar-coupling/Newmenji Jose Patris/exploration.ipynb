At the scale of atoms and electrons, many of the equations of classical mechanics, which describe how things move at everyday sizes and speeds, cease to be useful. In classical mechanics, objects exist in a specific place at a specific time. However, in quantum mechanics, objects instead exist in a haze of probability; they have a certain chance of being at point A, another chance of being at point B and so on.\n\n\nThree Concepts that we can relate to: \nQuantized properties:\nCertain properties, such as position, speed and color, can sometimes only occur in specific, set amounts, much like a dial that \"clicks\" from number to number. This challenged a fundamental assumption of classical mechanics, which said that such properties should exist on a smooth, continuous spectrum. To describe the idea that some properties \"clicked\" like a dial with specific settings, scientists coined the word \"quantized.\"\n\n\nhttps://www.livescience.com/33816-quantum-mechanics-explanation.html"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\n\n\n\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Reading the files:\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train=  pd.read_csv(\"../input/train.csv\")\n\n\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Descriptive Statistics: \n\nIndependent Varaibles:\nThe trianing set has molecule name, atom_index_1 (don't know what is that), type \n\nDependent and Target Variable:\nScalar coupling constant"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Distribution of the target Variable - Scalar coupling constant **\n\nThere are outliers in the target variable.

Those peaks are called satellite signals. \n\nThe fact that magnitude of scalar coupling does not depend on the molecular orientation does not contradict another fact that scalar coupling does depend on molecular geometry and in particular - molecular conformation. \n\nScalar coupling is also sometimes called as indirect spin-spin coupling and indirect dipole-dipole coupling\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Why Coupling Constants are necessary?**\nCoupling constants are very useful for discussing the structure and nature of chemical bonding in compounds containing fluorine.

For this purpose, the physics of spin-spin coupling is described and the way how spin-spin coupling constants (SSCCs) can be quantum mechanically determined.\n\n\nAnalysis method fulfills all requirements. J-OC-PSP makes it possible to partition the isotropic indirect SSCC J or its reduced analogue K as well as the four Ramsey terms (Fermi contact (FC), spin dipole (SD), diamagnetic spin orbit (DSO), paramagnetic spin orbit (PSO)) leading to J (or K) into Cartesian components (for the anisotropic Ramsey terms SD, DSO, PSO), orbital contributions or electron interaction terms. For the purpose of decoding the spin-spin coupling mechanism, FC, SD, DSO, and PSO coupling is discussed in detail and related to electronic and bonding features of the molecules in question. The myth of empirical and semiempirical relationships between SSCCs and bonding features is unveiled.\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17538726\n\n\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"scalar_coupling_contributions.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

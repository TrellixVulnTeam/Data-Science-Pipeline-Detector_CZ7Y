Project background\nThe shared bicycle system is a way of bicycle rental, which automatically obtains bicycle rental and return data through a network of self-service terminals throughout the city. Using this system, people can rent bicycles in one place and return them to different places as needed.\n\nThe data generated by the system clearly records the length of time the car is used, the place of departure, the place of arrival, and the elapsed time. Therefore, the bicycle sharing system is used as a sensor network, which can be used to study mobility in cities. In this project, it is required to analyze the influence of factors such as the number of shared bicycle rentals and weather and time based on historical usage data to predict the demand for shared bicycle rentals in the shared bicycle plan of the US capital, Washington, DC."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![The Bikeshare Planning](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQYqLSyhZlabEFkwzudA4Ncm9-Jz8vZ_5yVcA&usqp=CAU)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2.1 Asking questions\n\nQ.

This article evaluates recent studies on station-based bike sharing in literature and seeks answers to two main research questions: \nFirst, how do the weather conditions, built environment and land use, public transportation, socio-demographic attributes, temporal factors, and safety affect the bike-sharing trip demand? \n\nSecond, what are the most commonly used factors in literature affecting trip demand? \nFor this purpose, an overview of the factors affecting trip demands has been established to evaluate the performance of Bike-Share Programs(BSPs) comprehensively. The results can provide reliable estimate for planners or decision-makers in understanding the key factors contributing to bike-sharing demand. The information obtained from this overview can also be a guideline for BSP planners, policymakers and researchers to improve the efficiency of BSPs."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 3.

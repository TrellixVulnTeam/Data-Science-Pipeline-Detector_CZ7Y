I use the 'Bicing' service in Barcelona and I think it's an immensely practical way of getting around a modern city. While the data set released by the 'Bicing' service is less than impressive, I see that the DC bike share program has put out a rather clean data set which could be useful to visualize a few interesting trends. This data set is fairly old now, but I doubt human behavior in urban settings has changed significantly in the last couple of years. Any conclusions that we might draw from this must essentially hold, at least for the DC area, and to a lesser extent, other cities (think different weather patterns, mobility cultures, etc.).

Clearly, the warmer months should have a higher usage. We will plot the average temperatures from each season to see it alongside the corresponding bike usage. We can also split the user base into casual and registered users to see if there are any differences in  behavior patterns. Perhaps, registered users remain committed even in the colder seasons as they are likely to be using the bikes for their daily commute?

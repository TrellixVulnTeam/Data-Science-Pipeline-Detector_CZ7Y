Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.\n\nThe data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed is explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. In this competition, participants are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"## Imports\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.express as px","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-26T09:06:25.983688Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-26T09:06:25.984172Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-26T09:06:25.987681Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-26T09:06:25.984141Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-26T09:06:25.986853Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"## Constants\ndir = '../input/bike-sharing-demand/'","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-26T09:06:25.988729Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-26T09:06:25.989106Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-26T09:06:26.004483Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-26T09:06:25.989081Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-26T09:06:26.003829Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"## Util functions\ndef plot_count(x, y, xlabel, ylabel, title, xrotation=None, yrotation=None, horizontal=False):\n    plt.xlabel(xlabel)\n    plt.ylabel(ylabel)\n    plt.title(title)\n    if xrotation:\n        plt.xticks(rotation=xrotation)\n    if yrotation:\n        plt.yticks(rotation=yrotation)\n    if horizontal:\n        plt.barh(x, y)\n    else:\n        plt.bar(x, y)\n        \ndef sns_count_plot(data, x, xlabel, ylabel, title, hue=None, xrotation=None, yrotation=None):\n    plt.xlabel(xlabel)\n    plt.ylabel(ylabel)\n    plt.title(title)\n    if xrotation:\n        plt.xticks(rotation=xrotation)\n    if yrotation:\n        plt.yticks(rotation=yrotation)\n    sns.countplot(x=x, data=data, hue=hue);\n    \ndef sns_bar_plot(data, x, y, xlabel, ylabel, title, hue=None, xrotation=None, yrotation=None):\n    plt.xlabel(xlabel)\n    plt.ylabel(ylabel)\n    plt.title(title)\n    if xrotation:\n        plt.xticks(rotation=xrotation)\n    if yrotation:\n        plt.yticks(rotation=yrotation)\n    sns.barplot(x=x, y=y, data=data, hue=hue);","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-26T09:06:26.005704Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-26T09:06:26.006155Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-26T09:06:26.016395Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-26T09:06:26.006128Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-26T09:06:26.015556Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"## Read data\ntrain = pd.read_csv(dir + 'train.csv')\ntest = pd.read_csv(dir + 'test.csv')\nsample_submission = pd.read_csv(dir + 'sampleSubmission.csv')\nprint(f\"Train {train.shape}\")\nprint(f\"Test {test.shape}\")\ntrain.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-26T09:06:26.017765Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-26T09:06:26.018033Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-26T09:06:26.120205Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-26T09:06:26.018008Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-26T09:06:26.119462Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Data Fields\n\n* datetime - hourly date + timestamp \n* season -  1 = spring, 2 = summer, 3 = fall, 4 = winter \n* holiday - whether the day is considered a holiday\n* workingday - whether the day is neither a weekend nor holiday\n* weather - \n    1.

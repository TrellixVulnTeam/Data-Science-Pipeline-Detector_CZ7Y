When a stock or derivative is undervalued, it makes sense to buy. If it's overvalued, perhaps it's time to sell. While these finance decisions were historically made manually by professionals, technology has ushered in new opportunities for retail investors. Data scientists, specifically, may be interested to explore quantitative trading, where decisions are executed programmatically based on predictions from trained models. In this competition, financial data for the Japanese market will be provided, allowing retail investors to analyze the market to the fullest extent. \n\nJapan Exchange Group, Inc. (JPX) is a holding company operating one of the largest stock exchanges in the world, Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), and derivatives exchanges Osaka Exchange (OSE) and Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM). JPX is [hosting this competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jpx-tokyo-stock-exchange-prediction) and is supported by AI technology company AlpacaJapan Co., Ltd.\n\nThis competition will involve building portfolios from the stocks eligible for predictions. Specifically, each participant ranks the stocks from highest to lowest expected returns and is evaluated on the difference in returns between the top and bottom 200 stocks. You'll have access to financial data from the Japanese market, such as stock information and historical stock prices to train and test your model. After the training phase is complete, the competition will compare your models against real future returns.\n\nThe training data begins in January 2017 with about 1,860 stocks with new stocks added through December 2020 for a total of 2,000 stocks.

Conversely, when the 10-Day MA/EMA crosses the 50-Day MA/EMA from below, the closing price increases, which typically indicates a buy signal.

For each forecast day, all active stocks will be ranked in order of their predicted return. The returns for a single day treat the 200 highest (e.g. 0 to 199) ranked stocks as purchased and the lowest (e.g. 1800 to 1999) ranked 200 stocks as shorted. The stocks are then weighted based on their ranks and the total returns for the portfolio are calculated assuming the stocks were purchased the next day and sold the day after that. \n\nSince risk control is also an important element of investment, the competing score is the mean/standard deviation of the time series of daily spread returns, rather than the simple mean or sum of daily spread returns. This makes it necessary to build a model that can respond to changes in the distribution of data and produce stable and high performance, rather than a model that only wins big on certain days. You can find a python implementation of this metric [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/smeitoma/jpx-competition-metric-definition).

In this competition contestants have to rank the stock movements per day identifying the 200 stocks predicted to go up the most and the 200 predicted to go down the most. The target is calculated as the difference between the adjusted closing price of the next valid trading day and the adjusted closing price of the valid trading day after that. Because the time frame is short this increases the difficulty of the predictive task. Since there are so many stocks involved we will investigate whether modelling past stock movements as a network can be useful to create features to predict future stock price movements.\n\nSpecifically, we transform the input data to have each stock as a separate column with the target per date and per stock as the contents of the dataframe. We restrict our dataset to the 232 days of training data where all the original 2000 stocks had a valid target. For earlier dates some stocks had not yet listed and will not have a valid target. Once we have done this we create a network with each stock as a node. Then we create edges between any stocks that both had a positive target value on the same date. The weight of the edge between the nodes is the sum total of all the positive target values for both stocks but only on the days that both had a positive target. This may uncover some interesting links between stocks that other traditional feature engineering may not discover. This is an exploratory piece of work so there is no guarantee the features will be effective, but at least we should get some cool visuals that may also help us to understand the data better.\n\nIn case this terminology seems confusing there is a tutorial [here](https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/tutorial.html) which provides an introduction to network models using networkx.\n\nTo illustrate the process I first start with creating a network just for the first 50 of the 2000 stocks. The network is shown in the viz below. The nodes are colored by how many connections they have to other nodes. The technical term for this in networks is the node degree, which is the number of edges they share with other nodes. The brigher the red the more edges are shared with other nodes and the fainter the red the fewer edges are shared with other nodes.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def generate_options(node_color, weights, edges):\n    colors = plt.cm.Reds(np.linspace(0, 1, 9))\n    color_codes = [colors[x] for x in node_color]\n    options = {\n        \"node_color\": color_codes,\n        \"node_size\": 20,\n        \"width\": 0.25,\n        \"edge_color\": weights,\n        \"edgelist\": edges, \n        \"edge_cmap\": plt.cm.Blues,\n        \"with_labels\": False,\n    }\n    \n    return options\n\ndef get_node_color():\n    node_color = []\n    for node in G.nodes():\n        if G.degree(node) == 0:\n            node_color.append(0)        \n        elif G.degree(node) == 1:\n            node_color.append(1)        \n        elif G.degree(node) < 10:\n            node_color.append(2)        \n        elif G.degree(node) < 40:\n            node_color.append(3)        \n        elif G.degree(node) < 100:\n            node_color.append(4)        \n        elif G.degree(node) < 400:\n            node_color.append(5)        \n        elif G.degree(node) < 1000:\n            node_color.append(6)        \n        elif G.degree(node) < 1900:\n            node_color.append(7)\n        else:\n            node_color.append(8)\n            \n    return node_color\n\ndef create_graph(colz):\n    G = nx.Graph()\n\n    \n    colz\n\n    for c in colz:\n        G.add_node(c)\n\n    for o in colz:\n        for i in colz:\n            if o==i:\n                continue\n            else:\n                iter_mask = (df[o] > 0) * (df[i] > 0)\n                iter_weight = df.loc[iter_mask == True, [o, i]].sum().sum()\n                G.add_edge(o, i, weight=iter_weight)\n\n\n    edges,weights = zip(*nx.get_edge_attributes(G,'weight').items())\n\n    df_weights = (pd.DataFrame(np.array(list(zip(*nx.get_edge_attributes(G,'weight').items())), dtype=object).T, \n                               columns=['edge', 'weight']).sort_values(by=['weight'])).reset_index(drop=True)\n    df_weights\n    \n    return G, edges, weights, df_weights\n\n\ncolz = list(df.columns)[:50]\n\nG, edges, weights, df_weights = create_graph(colz)\n\nmquantiles = [0.003, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.32, 0.5, 0.68, 0.8, 0.9, 0.95, 0.997, 0.999, 0.9999]\n#mquantiles = [0.1, 0.9, 0.95]#, 0.997, 0.999, 0.9999]\n\ncolors = range(8)\nnode_color = get_node_color()       \noptions = generate_options(node_color, weights, edges)\n\nplt.figure(figsize=(12,8))\nplt.title(\"Securities Price Movement Up Days Network for 50 stocks\")\nnx.draw(G, **options)\n\ndel edges, weights, node_color, options\ngc.collect();","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-22T11:05:44.12157Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-22T11:05:44.122124Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-22T11:05:49.370326Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-06-22T11:05:44.122078Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-06-22T11:05:49.369455Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<b>Please remember to upvote if you like this notebook</b>\n\nWe can get a sense of the weights by a cumulative count chart.

Paring back the edges will increasingly focus in towards this tail and the community detection algorithms will find the communities of nodes that feature strongly in that tail.\n\n ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"generate_full_graph = False\n\nif generate_full_graph:\n    # create graph\n    colz = list(df.columns)\n    G, edges, weights, df_weights = create_graph(colz)\n    # save the full graph - in a later version we will load this rather than recalculating\n    nx.write_gpickle(G, \"fullgraph.gpickle\")\nelse:\n    G = nx.read_gpickle(\"../input/jpx-network-models-features/fullgraph.gpickle\")\n    # we need to save this back to the dataset because it gets overwritten by new runs of the notebook\n    nx.write_gpickle(G, \"fullgraph.gpickle\")\n    edges,weights = zip(*nx.get_edge_attributes(G,'weight').items())\n    df_weights = (pd.DataFrame(np.array(list(zip(*nx.get_edge_attributes(G,'weight').items())), dtype=object).T, \n                               columns=['edge', 'weight']).sort_values(by=['weight'])).reset_index(drop=True)\n\n\nvalues, base = np.histogram(df_weights['weight'], bins=len(df_weights['weight']))\n#evaluate the cumulative\ncumulative = np.cumsum(values)\n# plot the cumulative function\nplt.figure(figsize=(12,8))\nplt.plot(base[:-1], cumulative, c='blue')\nplt.title(\"Cumulative Count of Network Edge Weights\")\nplt.ticklabel_format(style='plain')\n\nplt.show()","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":false,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-22T11:05:56.465573Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-22T11:05:56.466875Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-22T11:06:43.956091Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-06-22T11:05:56.466826Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-06-22T11:06:43.95483Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# prepare the first numeric features\ndf_securities = df_securities['SecuritiesCode'].to_frame()\ndf_securities = get_cfcc(G, df_securities)\n","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-22T11:06:43.959151Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-22T11:06:43.959536Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-22T11:08:40.306832Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-06-22T11:06:43.959506Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-06-22T11:08:40.305116Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"edges,weights = zip(*nx.get_edge_attributes(G,'weight').items())\nnode_color = get_node_color()       \noptions = generate_options(node_color, weights, edges)\nplt.figure(figsize=(12,8))\nplt.title(\"Securities Price Movement Up Days Network for All Stocks\")\nnx.draw(G, **options)\n\ndel edges, weights, node_color, options\ngc.collect();","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-22T11:08:40.309854Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-06-22T11:08:40.311239Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# prepare the community detection categorical features\nG, df_securities, graph_list = paring_back_network(G, mquantiles, df_securities, show_viz=True)","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here are our new features created for all securities. <i>More to follow </i>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df_securities.to_csv(\"network_features.csv\", index=False)\ndf_securities","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<b>Please remember to upvote if you found this notebook informative.</b>\n\nWe save our graph and features for later use.

We then call the output_notebook function, setting the resources parameter to INLINE because it is important to install BokehJS before plotting otherwise the plots from bokeh cannot function, thus, bokeh's candlestick plots required the dataframes to have a date index, we create a new data index in the options dataframe by defining the dataframe again, but with the index attribute indicating that we are creating another data index key to the DatetimeIndex function from the pd module, containing the 'Date' data index from options_df dataframe.

First, we create a new figure with the plt module with the figure function. Then, we set two variables, width and width2 to .4 and .05, so that we need to define them the width of candlestick elements. We also define two variables for up and down prices, which were up and down to the kyokuyo dataframe with the slice index of itself with the Close data attribute that is greather than or equal to (less than for the down variable) to kyokuyo dataframe with the Open data attribute. Next, we are going to define color variables, col1 and col2 to red (green for the col2 variable) in strings. \n\nNow let's get to the most exciting part, plotting the prices. For plotting the up prices, we use the plt module with the bar function three times, containing the up variable with the index data attribute, the up variable with the Close data attribute (High data attribute for the 2nd one and Low data attribute for the third one) minus the up variable with the Open data attribute (Close data attribute for the 2nd one and Open data attribute again for the 3rd one), the variable width (width2 for 2nd and 3rd one), the bottom attribute set to the up variable again but with the Open data attribute (Close data attribute for the 2nd one, Open data attribute for the third one), and color set to the col1 variable. \n\nWe then plot the down prices, setting the plt module with the bar function, containing the down variable with the index data attribute, down variable with the Close data attribute (High data attribute for the 2nd one and Low data attribute for the 3rd one) minus the down variable with the Open data attribute (2nd one same, Close data attribute for the 3rd one), the width variable (width2 variable for the 2nd and 3rd one), the bottom attribute set to the down variable with the Open data attribute (same to 2nd one, Close data attribute to the 3rd one), and the color attribute set to the col2 variable.\n\nWe proceed to rotate the x-axis thus ticking labels by using the plt module with the xticks function, setting the rotation parameter to 45 and ha to right.

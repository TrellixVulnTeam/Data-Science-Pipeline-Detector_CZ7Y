The model will use the closing price ($C_{(k, t)}$) until that business day ($t$) and other data every business day as input data for a stock ($k$), and predict rate of change ($r_{(k, t)}$) of closing price of the top 200 stocks and bottom 200 stocks on the following business day ($C_{(k, t+1)}$) to next following business day ($C_{(k, t+2)}$)\n\n    $$\n    r_{(k, t)} = \\frac{C_{(k, t+2)} - C_{(k, t+1)}}{C_{(k, t+1)}}\n    $$\n    \n2.

The daily spread return is calculated every business day during the public/private period and obtained as a time series for that period. The mean/standard deviation of the time series of daily spread returns is used as the score.

The Kagger with the largest score for the private period wins.","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.008025,"end_time":"2022-04-04T00:59:44.13181","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-04-04T00:59:44.123785","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Evaluation function code","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.008363,"end_time":"2022-04-04T00:59:44.148419","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-04-04T00:59:44.140056","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\n\ndef calc_spread_return_sharpe(df: pd.DataFrame, portfolio_size: int = 200, toprank_weight_ratio: float = 2) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Args:\n        df (pd.DataFrame): predicted results\n        portfolio_size (int): # of equities to buy/sell\n        toprank_weight_ratio (float): the relative weight of the most highly ranked stock compared to the least.\n    Returns:\n        (float): sharpe ratio\n    \"\"\"\n    def _calc_spread_return_per_day(df, portfolio_size, toprank_weight_ratio):\n        \"\"\"\n        Args:\n            df (pd.DataFrame): predicted results\n            portfolio_size (int): # of equities to buy/sell\n            toprank_weight_ratio (float): the relative weight of the most highly ranked stock compared to the least.\n        Returns:\n            (float): spread return\n        \"\"\"\n        assert df['Rank'].min() == 0\n        assert df['Rank'].max() == len(df['Rank']) - 1\n        weights = np.linspace(start=toprank_weight_ratio, stop=1, num=portfolio_size)\n        purchase = (df.sort_values(by='Rank')['Target'][:portfolio_size] * weights).sum() / weights.mean()\n        short = (df.sort_values(by='Rank', ascending=False)['Target'][:portfolio_size] * weights).sum() / weights.mean()\n        return purchase - short\n\n    buf = df.groupby('Date').apply(_calc_spread_return_per_day, portfolio_size, toprank_weight_ratio)\n    sharpe_ratio = buf.mean() / buf.std()\n    return sharpe_ratio","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","papermill":{"duration":0.029976,"end_time":"2022-04-04T00:59:44.186504","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-04-04T00:59:44.156528","status":"completed"},"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-04T23:25:16.043484Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-04T23:25:16.044341Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-04T23:25:16.077587Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-04T23:25:16.044237Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-04T23:25:16.076719Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The following rules are used to determine which stocks are available for investment.\n\n* The top 2,000 common stocks by market capitalization that have been listed for at least one year as of 2021-12-31 are eligible for investment.\n\n* If a stock is designated as Securities Under Supervision or Securities to Be Delisted during the private period, it will be excluded from investment after the date of designation.\n\n* When calculating the score, the adjusted stock price is used.","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.007861,"end_time":"2022-04-04T00:59:44.202788","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-04-04T00:59:44.194927","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Intentions of problem\n\nIn general, it is not possible to assume that data will have the same distribution permanently in two different periods of financial market time-series data. For example, the nature of the market changed dramatically between February 2020 and March 2020 and beyond due to changes in global conditions caused by COVID-19 and other factors.\n\nIn the case of a competition that focuses on a financial market with shifting data distribution characteristics, we thought that the winner of the competition should be the Kaggler who constructed a robust model that does not depend on changes in the data distribution.\n\nBased on the above assumptions, the following were considered in the design of this competition\n\n* The number of stocks to be forecast each business day is the difference between the rate of change of 200 stocks, each of which is 10% or more than the number of stocks to be invested in (2000 stocks), so that the performance of the model can be competed without being affected by the events of individual stocks. In practice, however, institutional investors and funds often invest in 50-100 stocks, so there is a slight deviation from the real-world setting of the problem.\n\n* When calculating the daily spread return, a linear weight of 2 to 1 is applied to the 1-200 stocks, so that stocks with higher rates of return are placed in the first position.\n\n* Since \"risk control\" is also an important element of investment, the competing score is the **mean/standard deviation** of the time series of daily spread returns, rather than the simple mean or sum of daily spread returns. This makes it necessary to build a model that can respond to changes in the distribution of data and produce stable and high performance, rather than a model that only wins big on certain days.\n\n* The competition also provides option data and other data that can provide clues for estimating the volatility and risk factors of the market itself. These data may be used for more sophisticated risk control. Since the bottom 200 stocks are also included in the forecast, it is possible to adopt a market-neutral strategy (it is also possible to intentionally bias the beta toward the long side).","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.008531,"end_time":"2022-04-04T00:59:44.235929","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-04-04T00:59:44.227398","status":"completed"},"tags":[]}}]}

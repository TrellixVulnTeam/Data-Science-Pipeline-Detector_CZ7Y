we are expected to deliver the \"daily ranks\" of the 2000 stocks from the workday of 2021-12-06\tto 2022-02-28.\n\n### What really is the \"rank\" here?","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"from the competition [page](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/jpx-tokyo-stock-exchange-prediction/overview/evaluation), here is the explanation of the evaluation:\n\n### From the original page.\n\n1. The model will use the closing price ($C_{(k, t)}$) until that business day ($t$) and other data every business day as input data for a stock ($k$), and predict rate of change ($r_{(k, t)}$) of closing price of the top 200 stocks and bottom 200 stocks on the following business day ($C_{(k, t+1)}$) to next following business day ($C_{(k, t+2)}$)\n\n    $$\n    r_{(k, t)} = \\frac{C_{(k, t+2)} - C_{(k, t+1)}}{C_{(k, t+1)}}\n    $$\n    \n2. Within top 200 stock predicted ($up_i\\;\\;(i = 1, 2, \\ldots, 200)$), multiply by their respective rate of change with linear weights of 2-1 for rank 1-200 and denote their sum as $S_{up}$.\n\n    $$\n    S_{up} = \\frac{\\sum^{200}_{i=1}(r_{({up_i}, t)} * linear function(2, 1)_i))}{Average(linear function(2, 1))}\n    $$\n    \n3. Within bottom 200 stocks predicted  ($down_i\\;\\;(i = 1, 2, \\ldots, 200)$), multiply by their respective rate of change with linear weights of 2-1 for bottom rank 1-200 and denote their sum as $S_{down}$.\n\n    $$\n    S_{down} = \\frac{\\sum^{200}_{i=1}(r_{({down_i}, t)} * linear function(2, 1)_i)}{Average(linear function(2, 1))}\n    $$\n    \n4. The result of subtracting $S_{down}$ from $S_{up}$ is $R_{day}$ and is called \"**daily spread return**\".\n\n    $$\n    R_{day} = S_{up} - S_{down}\n    $$\n    \n5. The daily spread return is calculated every business day during the public/private period and obtained as a time series for that period. The mean/standard deviation of the time series of daily spread returns is used as the score. Score calculation formula (x is the business day of public/private period)\n\n    $$\n    Score = \\frac{Average(R_{day_1-day_x})}{STD(R_{day_1-day_x})}\n    $$\n    \n\n\n### If the above are confusing, here is my attempt to deconstruct it:\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1. Predict the daily return of all 2000 major stocks and rank them accordingly \n       * higest (top gainer)(rank 0,1,2...) to lowest (top loser)(rank ...,1998,1999,2000)\n   2. Pick the top 200 and bottom 200 of the daily list to calculate the weight\n   3. np.linspcace 2-1 weight their rank with the return to determine the long/short volume.\n   4. Assume all the positions are enter on the opening of the next day and close the day after that\n   5. from all the 200 long positions and 200 short positions you would get the 'Daily Spead Return' DSR\n   6. Use DSR from all 56 days to calculate the Sharpe Ratio and use as a competition score. Sharpe ratio is basically a ratio between the total return divided by the SD of itself duing the period.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Note for the scoring.\nSince the score is the Sharpe ratio, which consist of return divided by SD, remember that the other way of raising score is lower the SD of the portfolio. Don't focus only on return.\n\nNow, let's explore the data given, begining with the main focus, \"train_stock_prices\" which include the most liquid 2000 stocks in the market. And, also a stock universe for this competition.\n\n### Train_stock_prices\n   \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train_stock_prices.tail(3)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-22T05:02:51.538201Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-22T05:02:51.538521Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-22T05:02:51.553966Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-22T05:02:51.538488Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-22T05:02:51.553061Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here we have many columns containing many informations of certain stocks.

It was only after weeks that it emerged to neighbouring countries like South Korea, and later to Europe (currently the epicenter) and the rest of the world. We'll have a look at different countries where COVID19 has had a considerable effect: China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, Spain, USA, and Brazil. \n\nFrom the following plots we can see that China has stabilized both the number of confirmed cases and the number of deaths. South Korea and and Iran seemed like potential problematic spots initially, but they managed to control the spread of the virus. Italy and Spain, on the other hand, are still showing an exponential growth of confirmed cases even though both countries are under full lockdown. What's worse, their citizens are dying at a higher rate. Why could that be?\n\nThe number of infected people in the US is growing quickly; in a few days it will surely surpass Italy and China. However, the mortality rates in the US are rather low. Maybe the virus hasn't had enough time to kill the infected, or maybe the US health system is better prepared. We'll see in the following days.\n\nWe included Brazil for 2 reasons: first, Brazil is a huge country, similar to the US in population and in politcal leadership, so it will be interesting to see whether Brazil will follow USA's numbers; second, Brazil's health system is knowingly worse than that of first world countries â€“ will Brazil be able to handle this pandemic better than Italy or Spain?"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#df_countries['country'].unique()\ncountries_list = ['China', 'Korea, South', 'Italy', 'Iran', 'Spain', 'US',  'Brazil']\n\ndf_countries[df_countries['country'].isin(countries_list)].sort_values('date', ascending=False).head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"base = alt.Chart(\n    df_countries[df_countries['country'].isin(countries_list)]\n).mark_area(\n    interpolate = 'monotone',\n    fillOpacity = .8\n).encode(\n    x = 'date',\n    y = 'confirmed',\n    color = 'country'\n)\n\nbase.encode(y='confirmed') & base.encode(y='deaths')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The plot below is an interactive scatterplot + histogram.

According to our model, we can expect the number of cases to continue growing in a controlled manner, similar to what is happening in Iran and Switzerland where the number of infections is growing but not exponentially as it is in the US.\n\nAs days go by and the pandemic continues to develop, new data will allow us to update our model and verify our predictions.\n\nThere are 2 relevant ideas to keep in mind. First of all, our model is limited by the distance between the predictor countries (the 6 days between the 10th case in Brazil and the 10th case in other countries), which means we can only forecast a few days into the future. Second, there is a lot of noice in the dataset, since the number of tests may vary from day to day and not all confirmed cases may be reported in time. A longer pandemic would certainly mean a better dataset, but **let's hope this won't last much longer**."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

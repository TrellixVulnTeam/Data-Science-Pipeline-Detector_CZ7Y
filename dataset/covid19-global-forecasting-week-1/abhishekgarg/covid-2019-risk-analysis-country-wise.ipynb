Using this, we can take lessons from those countries. \n\nWe can keep updating the different dataset (source mentioned) used in this notebook to get updated \"Risk level\" for each country. We understand that, we do not have domain knowldege; hence providing flexibility to update any parameters and find the results which can be used anywhere to handle this pandemic. \n\nHope everything will be get normal soon!!"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Please suggest any edits if you have any to make this better..

Denmark was first country in Europe to declare lockdown. We can see that acceleration went to negative number (almost equal to one was the highest in past). Hence, active cases is getting little stagnated. Demark has announced lockdown till 13th April. We started getting positive impact of this.(reference: https://www.thelocal.dk/20200320/why-is-denmarks-lockdown-so-much-more-severe-than-swedens)\n2. Japan case study to tackle corona virus case. We can easily interpret how it went down in between and then went up for some time and further going down using case study mentioned. Initially one state of Japan took action (complete lockdown) but other states were lenient. But they took lesson from that state and implemented complete lockdown..  \n(reference: https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/japan-coronavirus-wakayama/2020/03/22/02da83bc-65f5-11ea-8a8e-5c5336b32760_story.html)  \n3. Behrain also declared lockdown. Positive impact of this one.. Reference: (https://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2020/03/bahrain-pardon-prisoners-coronavirus-formula-one.html )\n\n\n### here, our thought process is just to check any particular country doing well to handle COVID-2019. And check out what went well in the favour of those countries and then, try to apply similar things in other countries. \n##### we can take a good example of Denmark and Sweden: Both countries are very similar in terms of demogrpahics etc. But Denmark did pretty well in managing this pandemic. But Sweden was very lenient in initial phases of COVID-2019. Although, Growth rate of new cases is decreasing in sweden but still positive (means: growth of new cases is not exponential). But, on other side, growth rate in case of denmark is negative.

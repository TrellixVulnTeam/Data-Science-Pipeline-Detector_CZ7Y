Thanks\n# WELCOME\n\nWith the increasing spread of COVID19 (an ongoing pandemic of the coronavirus 2019), there has been a cause for alarm all over the world with every country at alert. This has led to the total shut down of some countries while a lot have remain fervent in their response to the disease. There have been rumors about its origin, some believe it originates from animals, some believe it was bioengineered, but no matter what the belief is, it is here already and we need to defeat it.... together. In this report, I make an analysis of the current situation of things as reported by the data provided here on kaggle. I hope you find it insightful and interesting.

It also spreads when a person touches a surface or object that has the virus on it, then touches their eyes, nose, or mouth. Its common symptoms include:\n1. Fever\n2. Cough\n3. Shortness of breath\n\nAnd the symptoms can start to show up 2 - 14 days after exposure\n\nLet me also state that stigmatization of races, ethnicity or tribe as a result of this issue is very poor of humans.

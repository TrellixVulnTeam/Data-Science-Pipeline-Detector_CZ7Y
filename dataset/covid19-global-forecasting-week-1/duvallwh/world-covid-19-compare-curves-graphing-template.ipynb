I introduce compair_curves which attempts to line up the curves from two different regions. From what I can tell Italy and Spain are lined up pretty close, California is progressing slower than Italy, but New York is showing a faster rate of infection that Italy. I know that there are many factors that go into these 'curves' and will be updating this kernal with any comments/sugestions provided. \n\nI also included my EDA which did not get any votes from my last kernal, but shows very clearly the effectivness of China's lockdown.\n\n- from previous kernal\n\nThe more I look at the data the more it becomes abundantly clear that \"locking down\" is essential to slow the spread of the desease. After an early lockdown all of China's provences other than Hubei (Wuhan) kept their confirmed cases under 1,500. Wuhan did not lock down sooner as it was the epicenter of the spread, so this is the best model of what is to come. However, China locked down Wuhan with significantly less confirmed cases than most areas in Europe, Iran, and some of the US States. I am here in CA and I know that after two days of lock down there is significantly less movement, however I am pretty sure it is not near how it was in China. My wife is from Mexico and she told me they are already starting the \"quarentera\" which is a 40 day lock down. In addition many countries in South America are doing the same. What is happening in Europe and New York is unprecidented and will be hard to predict, the authorities in those areas let the desease spread more than it did in Wuhan before they locked down. In this notebook I will be developing a prediction model using the avaialable data and visulizing the 'curves' as I go. I am an Air Quality/Weather Engineer by trade, so at some point I will try to incorperate weather data into my analysis. \n\nI looked at the data using pandas and pyplot. From this initial look I can tell that there is training data for 284 Country/Area combinations from 1/22/20 through 3/18/20 and the compition will be judged using data from these same Country/Area combinations from 3/12 through 4/23. I used \"f-strings\" to output the various numbers/dates I was looking for in the dataset to make everything look better.

It is pretty clear that China's lockdown worked. I will see what kind of conection I can make using the number of cases once lockdown starts to the total number of current cases, which for China is when the daily new cases stopped for the most part. Clearly there are many factors which are hidden in the ConfirmedCases variable which include \"tests avaiable\", \"showing symptoms\", and \"percent age group in region\" to name a few. From what I can tell on the news China locked down the contry pretty uniformly on 1/23/2020. I used 1/25 as the starting point to calculate the growth factor for the various regions in China as the numbers on the 23rd were pretty small and likely not very representative of the overall infection rate. The \"lockdown\" initial count can be changed using the START_DATE constant. \n\nI made histograms to veiw the distribution of the confirmed cases during the start and end of the analysis along with the calculated 'Growth Rates'. It is pretty clear that Wuhan is an outlier in all three of these categories. The number of cases was around 90 times when the outbreak subsided in Wuhan than the modeled 'start date' when the lockdowns began. The rest of the regions went up between 10 - 40 times the initial value before the numbers started to flatten out. There are many possible reasons for this. The amount of people infected / the amount of people tested is the first one that comes to mind.

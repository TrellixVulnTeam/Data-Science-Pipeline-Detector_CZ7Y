Please note that there are multiple reasons to explain the unreported cases, including:\n\n* Unable to identify/ diagnose the patients given the untypical symptoms;\n* Unable to effectively sample the patients;\n* PCR (polymerease chain reaction) results were false negative;\n* Low test capacity, etc\n\nThis analysis is not intended to understand why there were unreported cases but rather to quantify how many cases were unidentified.

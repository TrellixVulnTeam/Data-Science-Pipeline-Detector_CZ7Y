{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Estimate Current Number of Covid19 Cases and Predict Future Number of Covid19 Cases/Deaths Based on Current Death Rate Data"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Covid19 was first reported in China during December 2019.  On January 23, 2020 China issued lockdown orders for Wuhan and three other cities as the virus spread.  The lockdown was extended on January 24, 2020.  On January 30,2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared Covid19 a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). On February 25, 2020, Italy put the Lombardy region on lockdown due to Covid19.  One March 9, 2020, Italy expanded the lockdown to include the entire country.  On March 11, 2020, WHO declared Covid19 a global pandemic. Since the first reported case in Dec 2019, approximately three months ago, Covid19 has spread to 167 countries and regions. The United States has started to see widespread cases of Covid19, especially in New York, California and Oregon. Other countries have also been experiencing large numbers of Covid19 infections, specifically Spain, Germany, Iran and France. Many countries have introduced measures to control the virus such as closing schools, promoting social distancing, handwashing, quarantines and lockdowns.  It is likely that these measures have slowed the spread of the virus although there are concerns that it is not enough and that hospitals worldwide are going to overwhelmed with large numbers of Covid19 patients. Most officials seem to agree that the virus is going to keep spreading and that complete containment is not possible at this point. The goal at this point is to slow down the spread of the virus so that hospitals aren't overwhelmed with large numbers of Covid19 patients.\n\nThis model/analysis has two goals: 1) Estimate the number of cases in each country/region since the virus first started spreading and 2) Predict the numbers of future cases as well as the number of deaths for each country/region. \n\nThe first goal is to estimate the number of cases in each country/region since the virus was first detected in each area.  This estimate is important because the current number of positive cases is unknown in many areas due to lack of widespread testing. Some countries (such as South Korea) instituted widespread drive through testing centers and these countries likely have a better estimate of the spread of the virus. However, other countries have not instituted widespread testing and so the true extent of the spread of the virus is unknown.  The estimated number of cases is calculated with the reported death rate. The death rate is likely more accurate than the number of cases and can give a rough estimate of the actual number of cases.  The death rate is used to calculate the estimated cases by first assuming a certain mortality rate, and time frame that someone dies after contracting Covid19.  For example if the mortality rate is 1% and it takes 25 days for someone to die after they are first exposed, then it is known that 25 days ago 100 people were positive for each reported death. The current number of positive cases can then be estimated based on exponential growth patterns. If 100 people were positive 25 days ago for each reported death, and if the doubling rate is 5 days, then it can be estimated that 1600 people are currently infected for each reported death. \n\n| Days | Cases|\n|------|------|\n|   0  | 100  |\n|   5  | 200  |\n|   10 | 400  |\n|   15 | 800  |\n|   20 | 1600 |\n|   25 | 3200 |\n\nThe second goal is to predict the future cases/deaths based on the number of cases estimated during the first goal. The model used to describe the data calculates the change in concentration (cases, deaths etc) with time using the following equation: \n\n$\\frac{dC_A}{dt} = k C_A^{\\alpha}$\n\nThere have been many papers and early estimates of the models parameters published either in journals are simply online such as the mortality rate, doubling rate, $R_o$, time from infection to becoming symptomatic, and time from displaying first symptoms to death. These parameters vary by country and also in some cases with time. For instance, the mortality rate in Italy has appeared to recently increase. It's unclear if this is because the data is early, there are less positive cases being reported, or if the mortality rate has actually increased. Some countries have had extremely low mortality rates while others have had higher mortality rates. Other parameters such as the growth factor have been difficult to estimate for many countries because data is still sparse.  It is likely that in a few weeks the growth factor will become more clear in many countries/regions. The growth factor is important because if it is calculated as a function of time it is possible to tell when the virus is on the decline. So if the growth factor is greater than one the virus is still increasing, if it is equal to one it has stabalized and if it is less than one it is declining (upper portion of logistic curve).  All current data suggests that most countries currently have a growth factor greater than one (exceptions are China and South Korea) but with sparse data it is difficult to calculate a reliable growth factor. The parameters used in the model are estimated from available data and/or taken from available literature that is becoming more prevalent everyday. \n\nKeep in mind that many assumptions go into this model and that the \"estimated\" and \"predicted\" results are just one scenario. This virus is spreading quickly and as a result data, parameters, and models are evolving daily. \n\nThank you to John Hopkins University for making the data set public.

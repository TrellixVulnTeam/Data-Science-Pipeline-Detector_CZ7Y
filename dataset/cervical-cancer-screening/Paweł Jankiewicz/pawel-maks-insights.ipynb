{"cells":[{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"These insights would be hard to reproduce using SQLite instance that is provided. We spent many days of calculation testing this data. \n\nIn the last 2 weeks or so we started to extract \"likelihood\" features. \nWe realized that there exists many interactions in the data but they were present only looking at the head tables.\nAfter the data was aggregated at a patient level those interactions were already lost so we worked on the solution to\ncheck which combinations of features gave the best results. This resulted in some interesting findings.\n\nHow to calculate the likelihood of screening for the patient.\n------\n\nLet's say you want to calculate features on `diagnosis_head.diagnosis_code`.  \n\n1. Extract disting combinations of `patient_id` + `diagnosis_head.diagnosis_code`. \n\n\n    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS interaction_finder_distincts;\n    CREATE TABLE interaction_finder_distincts\n    as \n    SELECT DISTINCT\n        patients_all.patient_id,\n        diagnosis_head.diagnosis_code\n    FROM\n      patients_all\n      INNER JOIN diagnosis_head \n          ON diagnosis_head.patient_id = patients_all.patient_id\n      LEFT JOIN physicians\n          ON physicians.practitioner_id = diagnosis_head.primary_practitioner_id\n    GROUP BY 1,2; \n\n\n2. Calculate averages `is_screener` response for patients with this feature.\n\n\n    DROP TABLE IF EXISTS interaction_finder_avg_target;\n    CREATE TABLE interaction_finder_avg_target as\n    SELECT\n        d.dist,\n        AVG(CAST(patients_all.is_screener as float)) as avg_is_screener,\n        COUNT(*) as cnt,\n        COUNT(DISTINCT patients_all.patient_id) as cnt_patients\n    FROM\n        patients_train\n        INNER JOIN interaction_finder_distincts as d\n          ON patients_all.patient_id = d.patient_id\n    GROUP BY 1;\n\n3. Convert back to the patient level by aggreagating those averages.\n\n\n    SELECT\n         patients_all.patient_id,\n         MIN(CASE WHEN davg.cnt_patients >= 100 THEN davg.avg_is_screener ELSE NULL END) as risk_min_100,\n         MAX(CASE WHEN davg.cnt_patients >= 100 THEN davg.avg_is_screener ELSE NULL END) as risk_max_100\n    FROM \n         patients_all\n         INNER JOIN patients_obs_types po\n            ON patients_all.patient_id = po.patient_id\n         LEFT JOIN interaction_finder_distincts as d\n            ON patients_all.patient_id = d.patient_id\n         LEFT JOIN interaction_finder_avg_target as davg\n            ON d.dist = davg.dist \n    GROUP BY 1;\n\n    \nApart from `MAX` for values with at least 100 patients you can do the same with 5,10,25,50,100,250 patients. \nWhen taking fewer patients one must do it in a cross-validated fashion not to leak the target into the features.\nMany of those `MAX` variables had 0.88+ AUC.\n\nChecking the interactions\n------\n\nWe tested more than 120 interactions and below is the list of the interactions that were selected using a simple forward selection mechanism.\nIf an interaction worked it was kept in the model. The model used for evaluating the interactions was very simple XGBoost Classifier with `max_depth=6` and `n_estimators=100`. \nThe focus was on the speed of checking the interactions.\n\n![Interactions tested](http://i.imgur.com/lrE88k5.jpg)\n\nAdditional tables:\n\n`diag_proc_by_ym` - diagnosis_code + procedure_code in the same month\n\n`diag_diag_by_ym` - diagnosis_code + diagnosis_code in the same month (pairs of diagnoses)\n\nStrong interactions\n-----\n\n**Diagnosis code + primary_practitioner_id**\n\nWe had many insights just looking at this table. For example the interaction between `diagnosis_code` and `primary_practitioner_id` is particulary strong. It improved the result by a full point in AUC. \nHere we introduced it without `primary_practitioner_id`. We noted that even if we introduce `diagnosis_code` and `primary_practitioner_id` before introducing interaction between `diagnosis_code` and `primary_practitioner_id` it still improves the auc by 0.5 point.\n\nThis indirectly proves that there is dependency between practitioners and diagnoses. Some practitioners during the diagnosis seem to overproduce screenings and some underproduce:\n\n`P(is_screener | primary_practitioner_id) * P(is_screener | diagnosis_code) ~= P(is_screener | primary_practitioner & diagnosis_code)`\n\nThis can be used to target practitioners with low screening rates for particular diagnoses. For example some information campaign can be easily started based on this analysis.\n\n**diagnosis_code + claim_type + primary_physician_role***\n\nThis is self explanatory. Knowing the average screening rate for this 3-way interaction is a very strong predictor.\n\nSimilar strong interaction exists for procedure code.\n\nKnowing a few of those interactions can result in a very simple solution reaching 0.92 AUC.\nIt could be probably calculated in pure SQL just with simple averages.\n\n**Interactions with patient features**\n\nWe tested many interactions between patients and features above but it didn't result in many increases. This could mean that there are no strong dependencies between patient characterstics and diagnoses/procedures."},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":false},"outputs":[],"source":""},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":false},"outputs":[],"source":""},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":false},"outputs":[],"source":"\n"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":false},"outputs":[],"source":""},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":false},"outputs":[],"source":""}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}

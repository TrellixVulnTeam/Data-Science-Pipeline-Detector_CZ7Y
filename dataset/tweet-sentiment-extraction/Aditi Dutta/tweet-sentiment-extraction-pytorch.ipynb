It is a multi-layer bidirectional Transformer encoder. And it has been pre-trained on Wikipedia and BooksCorpus and requires task-specific fine-tuning.\n\n\n### What is the flow of information of a word in BERT?\nA word starts with its embedding representation from the embedding layer. Every layer does some multi-headed attention computation on the word representation of the previous layer to create a new intermediate representation. All these intermediate representations are of the same size. In the figure above, E1 is the embedding representation, T1 is the final output and Trm are the intermediate representations of the same token. In a 12-layers BERT model a token will have 12 intermediate representations.\n\n<img src=\"https://yashuseth.files.wordpress.com/2019/06/fig9.png\" width=\"500px\">\n\n### What are the tasks BERT has been pre-trained on?\nMasked Language Modeling and Next Sentence Prediction.\n\n### What is Masked Language Modeling and why use it over standard language modeling?\nLanguage Modeling is the task of predicting the next word given a sequence of words. In masked language modeling instead of predicting every next token, a percentage of input tokens is masked at random and only those masked tokens are predicted. Bi-directional models are more powerful than uni-directional language models. But in a multi-layered model bi-directional models do not work because the lower layers leak information and allow a token to see itself in later layers.\n\n### What is Next Sentence Prediction?\nNext sentence prediction task is a binary classification task in which, given a pair of sentences, it is predicted if the second sentence is the actual next sentence of the first sentence.\n\n\n\nBERT’s key technical innovation makes it a popular attention model to language modelling. This is in contrast to previous efforts which looked at a text sequence either from left to right or combined left-to-right and right-to-left training.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### What makes RoBERTa different?\n\nRoBERTa is an extension of BERT with changes to the pretraining procedure.

The tokenizer used here is byte-level BPE (BBPE), since it is compacter than character vocabulary and has no out-of-vocabulary tokens, and also more efficient than using pure bytes only. Studies show that BBPE has comparable performance to BPE while its size is only 1/8 of that for BPE.

Also it has some additional convenience features like `lowercase=True` and `addprefixspace=True`.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Want to know more about BPE?** <br>\nBPE is a frequency-based character concatenating algorithm: it starts with two-byte characters as tokens and based on the frequency of n-gram token-pairs, it includes additional, longer tokens.

Next, if `h` and `er` are frequently together, `her` is added to the vocabulary.

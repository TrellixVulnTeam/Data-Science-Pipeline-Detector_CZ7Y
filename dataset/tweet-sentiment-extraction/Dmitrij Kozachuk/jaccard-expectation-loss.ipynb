O.** present a post about new approach for Tween Segment Extraction (TSE) : https://www.kaggle.com/c/tweet-sentiment-extraction/discussion/142125. The was intresting idea about using Jaccard metric not only as metric, but as loss too: https://www.kaggle.com/c/tweet-sentiment-extraction/discussion/142125#820299. Using Jaccard as loss seems really attractive for me, cause it allows to prevent loss-metric bias (for instance, using BCE only has some disadvantages, explained in next sections). But this idea works only in case of segment prediction (one label \"00111100\" instead of start_label \"00100000\" and end label \"00000100\"), and even in this case we have a problem with continuity property: how to determine predicted segment from arbitrary prediction?<br>\n   <br>\n    In this notebooks i present two new losses, that seems to be usefull in TSE task:\n   - **W**eighted **BCE** (**WBCE**): BCE with taking into account order of items in prediction\n   - **J**accard **E**xpectation **L**oss (**JEL**): Using Jaccard metric as loss in \"traditional\" task formulations with two heads for start and end of text span prediction (with some trick, that i also explain below)\n   \nHope you're enjoyng mathematical proofs and improve your results with one of this losses.\n\n**Assumption**: In my opinion, we have strange behavior with competition Jaccard metric, cause of using set() in computation. It means, that, for instance:\n\n$$Jaccard(i \\text{ } am \\text{ } data \\text{ } scientist) = Jaccard(data \\text{ } i \\text{ } scientist \\text{ } am) = 1$$\n\nIt looks strange, but that happends rare, cause of $text$ and $selected\\_text$ are ordered simbol sequence from the same corpora. So, lets take into account simbol orders:\n<br><br>\n$$\nJaccard(i \\text{ } am \\text{ } data \\text{ } scientist) = Jaccard(data \\text{ } i \\text{ } scientist \\text{ } am) = 0\n$$\n$$\nJaccard(i \\text{ } am \\text{ } data \\text{ } scientist) = Jaccard(i \\text{ } am \\text{ } scientist \\text{ } data) = 0.5\n$$\n$$\nJaccard(i \\text{ } am \\text{ } data \\text{ } scientist) = Jaccard(i \\text{ } data \\text{ } scientist \\text{ } am) = 0.25\n$$\n\nThis score, i think, have very high correlation with competition Jaccard score, but make our discussion easier.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Why BCE can works wrong?\n\nLets consider some of disadvantages of BCE in TSE task.\n\n## Penalty untill ideal prediction\n\nThat's what i mean: if at some stage of SGD we have prediction like this\n    - true: [0  , 0  , 1  , 0  , 0  , 0  ] (start label or end label)\n    - pred: [0.1, 0.1, 0.4, 0.1, 0.2, 0.1]\nthen this prediction is alredy fine, but obviously $BCE(true, pred) \\neq 0$. Moreover, $BCE(true, pred^*) \\neq 0$ for each $pred^* \\neq true$, that seems way too unnesesarily penalty. It will be good to find some loss $L$, that can get $L(true, pred) \\approx 0$ for this example.\n\n##  Order Independence\n\nThat's in my opinion more important disadvantage. Examples again:\n    - true : [0  , 0  , 1  , 0  , 0  , 0  ]\n    - pred1: [0. , 0. , 0.1, 0. , 0. , 0.9]\n    - pred2: [0. , 0. , 0.1, 0. , 0.9, 0. ]\n    - pred3: [0. , 0. , 0.1, 0.9, 0. , 0. ]\n    \nBecause of index order independence of $BCE$, we get $BCE(true, pred_1) = BCE(true, pred_2) = BCE(true, pred_3)$. But obviously $pred_3$ is the best prediction, cause corresponding Jaccard score is higher then for another predictions. That's bad cause of two reasons:\n\n- BCE loss don't repeat Jaccard score behavior\n- This bad BCE property can create some area in model parameters space with constant loss, therefore with null gradient. It means, that in this space there was a lot of local minima (or maxima, or saddle point), that will stop your SGD optimization.\n\n##  Weighted BCE\n\nThat's a WBCE comes out time. Lets just spread some potential from true label for making $pred_3$ prediction the best:\n\n    - true      : [0  , 0  , 1, 0  , 0  , 0  ]\n    - potential : [0.2, 0.1, 0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3]\n    \nand then just weigh BCE vector by this potential vector. We also can tune potential construction:\n- different potential factor (0.1 in example - we also can multyply by 0.1 instead of adding)\n- biased potential (in example we can try to penalize left errors tougher, then right ones or vice versa)\n\nfor getting closer to Jaccard score behavior. But apparenly even optimized WBCE loss will have some fundamental difference from Jaccard score that never vanish.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Jaccard Expectation Loss\n\n## Denotes\n\nNow i introduce JEL. Lets say we consider one sample and try to predict start and end indexes of text span. Also introduce some natural notation:\n- $start\\_pred$, $end\\_pred$ - text span start/end prediction vectors\n- $start$, $end$ - start/end true one-encoding vectors\n- $x_{start}$, $x_{end}$ - inex of 1 in true start/end vectors\n- $l = length([x_{start}, x_{end}]) = x_{end} - x_{start} + 1 > 0$ - length of true text span\n\n(+1, cause in terns of this competition, length of segement with $x\\_start=x\\_end$ equals 1)\n\nThat OK with four argument dependences for JEL: $$JEL=JEL(start, end, start\\_pred, end\\_pred)$$ cause \n- $[start\\_pred, end\\_pred]$ - model output\n- $[start, end]$ - true label we can prepare.\n\nExample for understanding:\n    - start     : [0  , 1  , 0  , 0  , 0  , 0  ] (x_start = 1)\n    - end       : [0  , 0  , 0  , 0  , 1  , 0  ] (x_end = 4)\n    - start_pred: [0.1, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1, 0. , 0. ]\n    - end_pred  : [0. , 0. , 0.1, 0. , 0.6, 0.2]\n    - indexes   : [0  , 1  , 2  , 3  , 4  , 5  ]\n    \n## Why Expectation?\n\nFirst problem : we want to get prediction $x_{start}^*$, $x_{end}^*$ for $x_{start}$, $x_{end}$ with vectors $start\\_pred$ and $end\\_pred$ in way like that\n\n$$x_{start}^* = argmax(start\\_pred)$$\n$$x_{end}^* = argmax(end\\_pred)$$\n\nfor getting JEL counting more clear, but $argmax(\\cdot)$ function don't differentiable. But insead of tough $argmax(\\cdot)$ function we can use methematical expectation:\n\n$$x_{start}^* = E(x_{start}|start\\_pred) = <start\\_pred, indexes>$$\n$$x_{end}^* = E(x_{end}|end\\_pred) = <end\\_pred, indexes>$$\n\n($indexes$ just a range from 0 till MAX_LEN). Dot product with constant vecor is differentiable, so problem is solved. Some observation:\n- For prevent training-inference bias we have to use similar approach for getting prediction from probability vector at inference time.\n- If $start\\_pred$ or $end\\_pred$ near to delta-function (one item equal 1, other equal 0), then expectation equals argmax function. At first glance that's the case of most samples of  $start\\_pred$ or $end\\_pred$ in practice.\n\nNow it ehough to find JEL function with next dependences:\n$$JEL=JEL(x_{start}, x_{end}, x_{start}^*, x_{end}^*)$$\n\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Major Theory\n\nAt this section we will try transform Jaccard score fucntion:\n$$Jaccard = \\frac{length(Intersection)}{length(Union)}$$\n\nas a differentiable loss with as similar behavior as possible.

That's not so easy, cause the metric is sophisticated enough and we need to programm it in differentiable manner. It was hard in sone degree, but we do it! (advantages describing in **Theoretical Conclusion** part).\n<br><br>\nHope, this metric will help you to achive good score according to your aim. I don't use it yet, but going to do that this night. Please, let me know if this metric really can help you to get better score, than you already have (or don't helps whatsoever :) ).

In this competition even more since [semi-supervised learning](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tweet-sentiment-extraction/discussion/143094) may play a decisive role.\n\nAfter some Googling, I came across the (probably) initial dataset that has been used by the author of this (atypical) Kaggle challenge.\n\nIn this notebook, starting from the found dataset, I will attempt to create the **private test dataset** and will propose some ideas on how we can use this data to enhance our models.\n\n**Clean data**\n\nI believe that this is quite an important discovery, as the found dataset **has not been processed**. In the Exploratory Data Analysis part, we will see how salient information such as hashtags and uncensured words are present in that dataset. Also, and maybe even more important, all original 13 sentiments are still present (empty, sadness, enthusiasm, neutral, worry, surprise, love, fun, hate, happiness, boredom, relief, anger).\n\n**ðŸ’¡Ideas**\n\nAmong others, one of the main advantages we can have by using this dataset is to find a subset of the training data that better match the private dataset set and try to *overfit* a model to that data.\n\nAlso, as we will see later, the extra informations such as hahtags, tweet authors and sentiment can be used during pre and post-processing, as they play an important role in this challenge.\n\n**Data leakage**\n\nAs some of you correctly specified, we cannot says that this is _data leakage_ as the original dataset is mentioned in the challenge description: _The dataset is titled Sentiment Analysis: Emotion in Text tweets._ Nontheless, the link (https://www.figure-eight.com/data-for-everyone/) they refers to is broken.\n\nThe dataset is also available here in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/icw123/emotion "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Import ftfy and other libraries\n\nIn this notebook I will use `ftfy`.

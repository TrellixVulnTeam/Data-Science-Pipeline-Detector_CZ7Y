point out :\n\n### A) Question-Answering \n\nHere's some solution with in mind the extractive question answering problem :\n\n- Here is a solution by [Cheongwoong Kang](https://www.kaggle.com/cheongwoongkang) provided in his notebook titled: [**DistilBERT-QA Starter (+ cross-validation)**](https://www.kaggle.com/cheongwoongkang/distilbert-qa-starter-cross-validation)\n\n- Here is another solution by  [Jonathan Besomi](https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanbesomi) provided in his notebook titled: [**Question-Answering Starter pack**](https://www.kaggle.com/jonathanbesomi/question-answering-starter-pack/output)\n\n\n\n### B) Method with Pytorch and BERT\n\n[This](https://www.kaggle.com/abhishek/bert-base-uncased-using-pytorch) is kernel by *Abhishek Thakur* which his based on his  videos on youtube.

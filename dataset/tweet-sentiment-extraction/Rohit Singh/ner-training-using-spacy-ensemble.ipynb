Introduction\n\n* With all of the tweets circulating every second it is hard to tell whether the sentiment behind a specific tweet will impact a company, or a person's, brand for being viral (positive), or devastate profit because it strikes a negative tone. Capturing sentiment in language is important in these times where decisions and reactions are created and updated in seconds. But, which words actually lead to the sentiment description? In this competition you will need to pick out the part of the tweet (word or phrase) that reflects the sentiment.\n\n* The goal of this competition is to extract those word or phrases which determines the sentiment of whole tweet.\n\n> Disclaimer: The dataset for this competition contains text that may be considered profane, vulgar, or offensive.\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.1 About Tweet Sentiment Extraction Dataset\n\nThe data folder contains following files, all in csv format\n\n**Files**\n* `train.csv` - the training set\n* `test.csv` - the test set\n* `sample_submission.csv` - a sample submission file in the correct format\n\n**Columns**\n* `textID` - unique ID for each piece of text\n* `text` - the text of the tweet\n* `sentiment` - the general sentiment of the tweet\n* `selected_text` - [train only] the text that supports the tweet's sentiment"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.2 Competition metric:\n\nThe metric in this competition is the word-level Jaccard score.\nJaccard similarity or intersection over union is defined as size of intersection divided by size of union of two sets. Let’s take example of two sentences:\n\n`Sentence 1: AI is our friend and it has been friendly`\n\n`Sentence 2: AI and humans have always been friendly`\n\nIn order to calculate similarity using Jaccard similarity, we will first perform lemmatization to reduce words to the same root word. In our case, “friend” and “friendly” will both become “friend”, “has” and “have” will both become “has”.

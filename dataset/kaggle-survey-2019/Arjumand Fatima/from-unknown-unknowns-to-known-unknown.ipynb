In short I am complete newbie to the data science and machine learning world. Hence, quite nervous and not sure what to do. Apart from that, I am just left with around 5 hours till the deadline of this contest. Although I am not sure about where to start but I really want to give it a try. I think there will be some other fellows like me who are clueless about what to do :) A typical scenario in telling a story through data visualization involves finding answers to certain well defined questions. However, in this case, we don't even know the questions. So let's just start examining the questions asked in the survey one by one. Let's see what interesting information is available, may be we can find some good questions on the way, which we can then answer. The approach that I am going to use is to consider the simplest possible visualization for visualizing the results of each of the questions that were asked in the survey. At this step, I am dealing with unknown unknown. Based on the results of the visualizations, we will get some questions for further exploration: so we move from unknown unknown to known unknown which we can then further explore. I'll list these questions and will get back to answering them if time allows me to do so :)\n<br>\n<h1> Step 1: Load Data</h1>\nThe first step is to read the dataset from multiple_choice_responses.csv\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/kaggle-survey-2019/multiple_choice_responses.csv', header=None)\nprint(df.head())\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"We may further need to see textual responses categorized as \"Other\" for some questions, so we also need to load data from other_text_responses.csv"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_other = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/kaggle-survey-2019/other_text_responses.csv' , header=None)\nprint(df_other.head())\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Removing the first two rows from the datasets/dataframes which contain question number and question text."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = df.iloc[2:]\nprint(df.head())\ndf_other = df_other.iloc[2:]\nprint(df_other.head())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h4>A few import statements</h4>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1> Step 2: Age Distribution</h1>\nLet's see what is the age (in years) of the most of the respondants!\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.set(style=\"darkgrid\")\n\nax = sns.countplot(y=df[1], data=df,\n                   facecolor=(0, 0, 0, 0),\n                    linewidth=5,\n                    edgecolor=sns.color_palette(\"dark\", 3))\nax.set_title(\"Q1: What is your age (# years)?\")\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As evident from the age distribution, most of the respondants belong to the age bracket of 25-29 years, the second most common group is 22-24 years old people, then 30-34 and 18-21 and so on.

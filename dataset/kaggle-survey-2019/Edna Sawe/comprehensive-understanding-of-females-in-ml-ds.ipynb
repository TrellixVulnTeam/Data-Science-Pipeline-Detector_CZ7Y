This is the second-ever survey data challenge. \n\nThis year, the industry-wide survey presents a comprehensive view of the state of data science and machine learning. \n\nThe survey was live for three weeks in October, and after cleaning the data we have 19,717 responses. We will be using these responses from the survey to understand the ML and DS state.\n\nThe results include raw numbers about who is working with data, what’s happening with machine learning in different industries, and the best ways for new data scientists break into these fields. Kaggle managed to publish these data in form of raw format without compromising anonymization, which makes it an unusual example of a survey dataset."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**The challenge objective:**\nTo tell a data story about a subset of the data science community represented in this survey, through a combination of both narrative text and data exploration. A “story” could be defined any number of ways, and that’s deliberate. The challenge is to deeply explore (through data) the impact, priorities, or concerns of a specific group of data science and machine learning practitioners. That group can be defined in the macro (for example: anyone who does most of their coding in Python) or the micro (for example: female data science students studying machine learning in masters programs)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Submissions will be evaluated on the following:**\n\n1. **Composition** - Is there a clear narrative thread to the story that’s articulated and supported by data? The subject should be well defined, well researched, and well supported through the use of data and visualizations.\n2. **Originality** - Does the reader learn something new through this submission? Or is the reader challenged to think about something in a new way? It should be informative, thought provoking, and fresh all at the same time.\n3. **Documentation** - Are your code, and notebook, and additional data sources well documented so a reader can understand what you did? Are your sources clearly cited? A high quality analysis should be concise and clear at each step so the rationale is easy to follow and the process is reproducible"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://media.giphy.com/media/SRL18lj1i4UoM/giphy.gif)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**UNDERSTANDING THE DATA**"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"schema = pd.read_csv('../input/kaggle-survey-2019/survey_schema.csv')\nquestions = pd.read_csv('../input/kaggle-survey-2019/questions_only.csv')\nmcq = pd.read_csv('../input/kaggle-survey-2019/multiple_choice_responses.csv')\nresponses = pd.read_csv('../input/kaggle-survey-2019/other_text_responses.csv')\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"responses.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"From the responses data, there are a lot of empty data represented by NaN.

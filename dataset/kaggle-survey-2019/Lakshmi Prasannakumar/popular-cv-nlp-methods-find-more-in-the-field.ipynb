Ranging from building chatbots for customer support to document analysis NLP has found place in many user friendly products. On the other hand Self-Driving cars, surgical robots are all applications of Computer Vision field along with Robotics. \n\n**How is NLP and CV relevant for Kaggle?**\nMost of the popular courses offered on CV and NLP through platforms like Udacity and Coursera encourages the students to work on realtime application data available in Kaggle for developing skills in this field. Being the biggest hub for open source data, Kaggle plays an important role for fetching openly available data as well as using the notebook and hardware ( both GPU and TPU) service provided. This obiviously makes us believe that the recent Kaggle survey can tell us more about the popularity of CV and NLP among the users and their advanced methods. \n\n**Goal of this analysis:** Understand the frequency of users availing the CV and NLP resources available across the internet, the popular methods they are employing for building meaningful products. With this analysis we also look forward to find channels, groups etc to target for more CV and NLP users in the future surveys of Kaggle.\n\n****Approach:**** The survey had questionaire about the popular NLP methods and CV methods where the responses were typed in as text replies by the users. From the typed sentence we are trying to tokenize the words using NLTK Python library and extract the methods terms. With these method terms we try to build a WordCloud to spot the methods in the response and a frequency chart to understand their popularity.

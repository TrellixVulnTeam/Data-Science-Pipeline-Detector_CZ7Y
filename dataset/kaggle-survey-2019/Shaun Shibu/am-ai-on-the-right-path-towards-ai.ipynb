He explains that although AI attention is considerably smaller in India than in China or the USA, the increased AI interest has manifested itself in the following three ways:\n1) Industries have started working to skill their manpower to enable themselves to compete with other global players\n2) Educational institutions have started working on their curricula to include courses on machine learning and other relevant areas\n3) Individuals and professionals have started acquiring these skills and are comfortable investing in upgrading their own skills\nThese three areas will be the main focus of preliminary analysis to understand the extent to which AI has manifested itself in the population of India.

online university courses more in 2019 over 2018. It is a very encouraging fact to note that more students in India are gaining knowledge in the field of ML and AI through university based online courses. It wont be a matter of time before these Universitites offering online courses in these fields start to incorparate them in the educational programs as a separate course.\nIt is pretty evident from the above plot that majority of the survey participants from India who are students resort to Courseera as an online platform to complete data-science courses and the number is pretty significant compared Udemy, Kaggle courses, etc. Well, I dove a little deeper into why the disproportionate amount of people study from different online platforms and what drives these preferences. When considering the two most used platforms, Couresera and Udemy: \nWhen it comes to price, Coursera has a fixed monthly payment option (you pay US$50 to make as many courses as you’d like to), I think it’s all a matter of deciding how much time you’re willing to spend on online courses every month to see which of these will end up being cheaper to you. Udemy may be cheaper if you take courses at a slower rates or in smaller quantities, but not so if you have lots of spare time to invest in lots of courses.\nHowever, the differences aren’t only in price and payment methods. For example, whereas Udemy has courses developed by individuals, Coursera has mainly academic courses from top-notch universities. This may seem like a huge advantage for Coursera, as you know, *CERTIFICATES*, but it comes with a few problems. For instance, you will never see any university offering a “Microsoft Office Course”. Of course, universities teach their alumni to use this sort of software, but always as part of some bigger subject. So, if you’re looking forward to understand a software that may be useful to your career, be it Excel, Autocad or Photoshop, it may prove hard to find the right course for you in Coursera.\nBut, from the points discussed above a major factor is the business model Couresera follows of using a monthly subscription plan to have access to multiple courses. This targets the population who's used to monthly payment of bills and would prefer if they have access to multiple entities in one transaction.\n\nNow, that we've established why I think online platforms can have different impacts on different indivuals, taking the case of India, a general notion amongst the Indian crowd is emphasis of heavy weightage on the certificates attained.\n<img src=\"https://www.mooclab.club/attachments/coursera-certificate-jpg.539/\">\n\nA great deal of importance is given to \"proof\"(\"certificate\") of accolades in general which might lead to the notion of going for Coureera which offers fancier and more authorized versions of certifications from top notch universities as compared to Udemy.\n\nKUDOS TO THE DESIGNER OF THE CERTIFICATE BTW!!\n\n\nIt is also interesting to notice the surge in participants learning ML related stuff in their University courses which is a clear indicator that the country is investing in introducing data science courses in educational insititutions."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's see the favorite sources students in India like to

Logistic regression is only one of the many predictive models you can build with Python and R. Though Rstudio offers brilliant data visualization libraries, one aspect where Python edged out R is its well-built deep learning modules. Popular Python deep learning libraries including Tensorflow, Theano and Keras. These libraries are sufficiently documented and I am sure Siraj Raval has hundreds of Youtube tutorials on how to use them. To be completely honest, I’d rather spend an hour coding dCNNs (deep convolutional neural networks) in Keras than spending half a day figuring out how to implement them in R.\nDue to the rapid advancement in usage of Deep learning, the requirement of relevant easy modules became essential and this available with Python. This also can be another factor why is there is high proportion of users using Jupyter Notebooks.\nAnd yes, indeed Python has become the dominant force like the breed of snake shown in the picture above :)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Next, lets analyze the different programming languages used by data scientists in India and compare them to data scientists in the US."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"languages_used = ['Q18_Part_1','Q18_Part_2','Q18_Part_3','Q18_Part_4','Q18_Part_5','Q18_Part_6','Q18_Part_7','Q18_Part_8','Q18_Part_9','Q18_Part_10','Q18_Part_11','Q18_Part_12']\nl = list()\nfor i in languages_used:\n    df = indian_data_scientists.groupby([i]).count().loc[:,:'Time from Start to Finish (seconds)'].reset_index()\n    df.rename(columns = {'Time from Start to Finish (seconds)':'Frequency'}, inplace = True)\n    df.rename(columns = {i:'languages_used'}, inplace = True)\n    l.append(df)\nlanguages_used = pd.concat(l).reset_index(drop=True)\n#rawn = role_at_work_num.reset_index(drop=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"languages_used = languages_used[languages_used.languages_used!=0].reset_index(drop=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"languages_used.sort_values(by=['Frequency'],ascending=False,inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"languages_used['perc'] = (languages_used['Frequency']*100)/languages_used['Frequency'].sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 1, figsize=(15,5))\n\nplt.xticks(languages_used.index, languages_used.languages_used.str.upper(), rotation=60, horizontalalignment='right', fontsize=10)\nsns.set(style=\"whitegrid\")\n#tips = sns.load_dataset(\"tips\")\nax = sns.barplot(x=\"languages_used\", y=\"perc\",data=languages_used)\nax.set_title('Proportion of Programming Languages used to analyze data by Indian data scientists in 2019',fontsize=15)\nax.set(xlabel='Programming Languages Used', ylabel='Percentage of Participants in the survey')\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As expected, from the previous discussion, huge dominance by Python in the list of programming languages used by data scientists in India.

We are working on augmenting the productivity of existing pathologists and radiologists as the first (of many planned) pilot project in healthcare.

This can help shape fundamental concepts from a grass root level.\n* Getting a master's degree is pretty important to grow and end up in a high-paying data scientist position.\n* The most frequently sorted to online course platform is Coureseera and is probably the preferrable educational platform to go to.\n\n(2) What should I work on to be a successful data scientist in India:\n* Python as a programming language is the most used amongst data scientists followed by R and SQL. If you're looking to apply for data scientist positions in the US, it's an added advantage to familiarize yourself with Bash and Linux usage as well\n* Familiarity with usage of Jupyter Notebook as an IDE is unavoidable\n* If you ever look for a careeer switch as a data analyst, be sure to improve your R programming skills as it;s visualization tools are fancier and better for presentations\n* Artificial intelligence is finding its reaches in three major sectors in India namely Healthcare, Agriculture and Language Neural Network. In the first two sections, there is a lot of object detection and image processing techniques involved and hence, relevant topics and algorithms like CNN's are good to be familiarized with before entering the job market\n* Word embedding techniques seems to share a large proportion of NLP techniques used in both India and US and hence seems like a segment of NLP to concentrate more on\n* Google cloud platform is going to see a steady rise in increase of usage of its products(with an added advantage of it's cloud lead being of Indian descent) and hence, familiarity with these Google machine learning products will be an added advantage for future data scientist position jobs.\n\n(3) An open ended question to all of you  \n**AM I ON THE RIGHT PATH TOWARDS AI** or more over **IS INDIA ON THE RIGHT PATH TOWARDS AI**"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Introduction\n\nThe aim of this notebook is to have some curious insights of the data.\nOne usual way to present the data is to cross some few responses of a question with all the responses of other question, like what's the salary of the respondents who use that platform compared with the respondents who use the other platform.\n\nThe Sankey diagram lets compare all the responses of a question with all the responses of other question. The link between responses of one and another question is shown visually, and the number of respondents who share that two responses are available when hovering the flow.\n\nThe link is grey if the number or respondents of the link is proportional to the number of respondents of the source response and the target response. The more respondents in the link that it would be for a neutral distribution, The more greenish is the link. The green color indicates a positive trend. The same for the red color, but for a negative trend.\n\n# Table of contents\n\n- [Programming language](#Programming-language)\n- [Analyze data years vs machine learning years](#Analyze-data-years-vs-machine-learning-years)\n- [Cloud platforms and products](#Cloud-platforms-and-products)\n- [Hardware](#Hardware)\n- [Media sources vs platforms](#Media-sources-vs-platforms)\n- [Money](#Money)"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# !pip install nb_black\n# %load_ext nb_black\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom IPython.core.display import display, HTML\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\n# Import data\ndata_path = \"../input/kaggle-survey-2019/\"\nmultiple_choice_responses_19 = pd.read_csv(\n    data_path + \"multiple_choice_responses.csv\", engine=\"c\", low_memory=False\n)\nquestions_only_19 = pd.read_csv(data_path + \"questions_only.csv\", engine=\"c\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def plot_sankey(questions, threshold=0, diff=False):\n    \"\"\"This function plots a Sankey diagram from a list of two or more questions.\n\n    Parameters\n    ----------\n    questions: list of str\n        List of the questions to be plotted.\n    threshold: int\n        Relations below this value will be discarded.

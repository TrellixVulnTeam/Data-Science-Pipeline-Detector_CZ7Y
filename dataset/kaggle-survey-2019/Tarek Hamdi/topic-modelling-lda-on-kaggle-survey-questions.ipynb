For instance, question-and-answer sites such as Quora or Stackoverflow need to determine whether a question has already been asked before.\n\nIn legal matters, text similarity task allow to mitigate risks on a new contract, based on the assumption that if a new contract is similar to a existent one that has been proved to be resilient, the risk of this new contract being the cause of financial loss is minimised. Here is the principle of Case Law principle. Automatic linking of related documents ensures that identical situations are treated similarly in every case. Text similarity foster fairness and equality. Precedence retrieval of legal documents is an information retrieval task to retrieve prior case documents that are related to a given case document.\n\nIn customer services, AI system should be able to understand semantically similar queries from users and provide a uniform response. The emphasis on semantic similarity aims to create a system that recognizes language and word patterns to craft responses that are similar to how a human conversation works. For example, if the user asks “What has happened to my delivery?” or “What is wrong with my shipping?”, the user will expect the same response.\n\n![](https://websitedesign9100.blogspot.com/2019/11/blog-post.html)"},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nfrom plotly.offline import download_plotlyjs, init_notebook_mode, plot, iplot\nimport plotly as py\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nimport gensim\nfrom gensim import corpora, models, similarities\nimport logging\nimport tempfile\nfrom nltk.corpus import stopwords\nfrom string import punctuation\nfrom collections import OrderedDict\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport pyLDAvis.gensim\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n\ninit_notebook_mode(connected=True) #do not miss this line\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"questions = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/kaggle-survey-2019/questions_only.csv', low_memory=False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"questions.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Preparing a corpus for analysis and checking all entries\ncol = questions.columns[1:]\ncorpus=[]\na=[]\nfor q in col:\n        a=questions[q][0]\n        corpus.append(a)\n        \ncorpus","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"TEMP_FOLDER = tempfile.gettempdir()\nprint('Folder \"{}\" will be used to save temporary dictionary and corpus.'.format(TEMP_FOLDER))\n\nlogging.basicConfig(format='%(asctime)s : %(levelname)s : %(message)s', level=logging.INFO)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# removing common words and tokenizing\nstoplist = stopwords.words('english') + list(punctuation) + list(\"([)]?\") + [\")?\"]\n\ntexts = [[word for word in str(document).lower().split() if word not in stoplist] for document in corpus]\n\ndictionary = corpora.Dictionary(texts)\ndictionary.save(os.path.join(TEMP_FOLDER, 'kaggle_survey.dict'))  # store the dictionary, for future reference","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"corpus = [dictionary.doc2bow(text) for text in texts]\ncorpora.MmCorpus.serialize(os.path.join(TEMP_FOLDER, 'kaggle_survey.mm'), corpus)  # store to disk, for later use","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In the previous cells, I created a corpus of documents represented as a stream of vectors.

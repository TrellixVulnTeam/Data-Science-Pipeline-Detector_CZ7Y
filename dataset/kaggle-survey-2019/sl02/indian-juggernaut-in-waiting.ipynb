There were 34 questions in total. The questions ranged from the typical demographic related queries to questions on company size, workload size, activities performed, ML/cloud platforms, tools, lanaguages and algorithms, and frameworks and learning platforms.\n\nQuestions on undergrad major and work experience went missing in this survey.\n\nSome of the Multiple choice responses had spaces in them, which was surprising. As the multiple choice questions were treated independently of one another, the pairwise comparison of some multiple choice responses for some queries might not make sense."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Motivation\n\nI was curious to understand who makes up the Indian community, and what do they do on Kaggle and in general. My analysis broadly covers 3 areas:\n\n1. Demographics - Age, gender, Job title, Education, and Salary.\n2. Company and workload size - Size of the company, number of people invoved in Data Science workoads, time spent on DS/ML activities, investment in ML/Cloud in the last 5 years.\n3. Tools and frameworks used - Programming languages used/recommended, visualization libraries used, Deep learning frameworks, use of Cloud computing, and algorithms used.\n4. Learning and Development - Favourite media, popular online sources for learning.\n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Executive Summary\n\nNote: Numbers approximated due to rounding off errors"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"1. 4786(26%) of the respondents are from India - the highest among all of the represented countries.\n2. Over ~3800(80%) of these respondents are under 35 years of age, with 1400(29%) of them in the 18-21 years category.\n3. Needless to say but ~4000(80%) of reported gender is Male. In the Female category, 90% are under 35 years of age.\n4. ~2300(48%) of the respondents have a Bachelor's degree, followed by ~1700(35%) with a Master's degree. Representation of Doctoral degree holders is low at 250(4%). \n\n    4a. In the Doctoral degree category, the highest share of responses came from the 30-34 years category, while in the Master's degree category, it is the 22-24 years category that came out at the top.\n    \n5. Students are at the top of the list with ~1500(32%) responses, followed by Data Scientists and Software Engineers at 16% and 15% respectively.\n\n      5a. In the 30-34 years category, Doctoral students have the highest share of responses at 25%.\n  \n      5b. 27% of the responses in the 22-24 years age group are Master's degree holders.\n  \n      5c. Both in the Software Engineers and Statisticians group, the 22-24 years old have the highest share of responses at 35%.\n  \n      5d. In the Business Analyst, Data Scientists, Data Analysts, Data Engineers, DBAs, and Research Scientists groups, the most frequently occuring age groups is 25-29 years with the share of responses ranging from 22%-36%.\n  \n      5e. In the Product managers category, the respondents are slightly older at 35-39 years(25%).\n  \n      5f. A worrying point to note, while ~300(6%) of this population is Not employed, almost 90% in this segment are under 35 years of age.\n  \n      5g. Research Scientists is the only category that is represented in all age groups, including the 70+ category.\n\n6. In the Not employed category, almost 80% of the respondents hold either a Bachelor's or a Master's degree. Contrastingly, less than 5% of the respondents who have Some college degree are Not employed.\n\n7. Around 65% of the respondents have less than 5 years of experience coding either at work or school.\n   \n   7a. In the <1 year and 1-2 years experience writing code category, respondents with a Bachelor's degree have the highest share of responses at 50%.\n   \n   7b. However, in the years ranging from 3-5 years to +20 years, the most common education attained is a Master's degree.\n   \n   7c. In the 'I have never written code' category, almost 75% of the respondents have either a Bachelor's degree or Master's degree.\n \n8. Almost ~480(10%) of the respondents earn an annual compensation ranging from $0-$999.\n     \n   8a. There were a few respondents in the 18-21 years group reportedly earning  > $500K annually.\n   \n   8b. The mean salary in the population is \\$18K. Data Scientists in this population earn an average salary of \\$22K, which is higher than the average salary of $14K for a Data Scientist, reported on Glassdoors.\n   \n   8c. The top 3 jobs that will pay you well are: Product/Project Manager, Data Scientist, and Research Scientist - that order.\n \n9. Around ~1300(28%) of the respondents work for large companies of sizes ranging 1,000-9,999 employees to > 10,000 employees.\n10. In the 20+ workload size category, Software Engineers play an important role in executing Data science workloads.\n \n   10a. Only large sized companies - >= 1000 employees can afford workload sizes of 20+ to excute Data science workloads.\n \n11. Only ~480(10%) of the respondents claim to have Established ML methods deployed at work, indicating a lack of maturity in the adoption of ML methods to solve business problems.\n12. There is a relationship between the questions relating years of using code at work/school and years using ML methods. However, there are instances were respondets who have, say, <1 year of experience with coding claim to have either 2-3 years or 3-4 years of experience using ML methods.\n13. Across all company sizes categories, that is 0-49 employees to > 10,000 employees, 70% of the respondents have spent up to \\$1,000-\\$9,999 on ML/Cloud in the last 5 years.\n \n    13a. The mean spending on ML/Cloud in the last 5 years is approximately $10K. And, only the large companies - >=1,000 employees can afford to spend such monies.\n    \n14. Almost ~2800(59%) of the respondents prefer using local developments tools (RStudio, Jupyter) or Basic Statistical software in their day to day work.\n \n    14a. Almost 50% of the responses in each of the categories relating to years of coding, ranging from < 1 years to 10-20 years use local development tools. Only the 20+ years group deviate here. Here, 20% use local development tools, and an equal percentage also use spreadsheets.\n    \n    14b. In the 'I have never written code' category, interestingly, nearly 20% of the respondents claim to use local tools. I am not sure for what, though. But almost 60% of this group rely on spreadsheets, which is more reasonable.\n    \n15. Size of the company doesn't affect preference for using certain tools.\n16. ~1100(24%) of the responses given claim their time is spent on 'Analyze and understand data to influence product or business decisions'.\n    \n    16a. The average number of ML related activities performed regularly is only 1.\n    \n    16b. Across various ML methods, the most frequently occuring activity performed is: Analyze and understand data.\n    \n    16c. The younger folk, those with less than <5 years of coding experience are made to do the gruelling tasks such as 'Analyze and understand data'; this is observed across the various ML activity types there are. However, the seniors, those with >= 10 years of coding experience perform these activities way less frequently.\n\n17. With respect to using progamming languages regularly, the top 3, based on frequency of responses received are: Python, SQL, and R.\n    \n    17a. On average, the number of languages used regularly is 2.\n    \n    17b. Looking at the pairwise relationship between languages, a combination of Python and SQL received ~1240(26%) of the responses out, whereas Python and R received ~770(16%) of the responses.\n    \n    17c. Python is the number 2 language on Stackoverflow having risen several notches in the last few years.\n\n18. ~2700(57%) of the respondents recommend learning Python as a first language in order to make an entry into Data Science\n    \n    18a. The number of responses from regular users of Python who also recommend using Python is ~2600(54%).\n    \n    18b. However, only 3% of regular users of Python recommend R, and around 2% recommend using SQL.\n    \n    18c. In contrast, 23% of regular users of SQL recommend learning Python, and 13% of users of R recommend learning Python.\n \n19. Based on years coding experience, nearly 80% of the respondents ranging from <1 years to 10-20 years recommend using Python. The exception is the 20+ years group - only 40% recommend learning Python.\n20. Matplotlib (36%), Seaborn (26%) and ggplot2 (12%) are the top 3 visualization tools that are used regularly.\n     \n     20a. On average, respondents use 2 tools regularly.\n     \n     20b. ~2600(54%) of the regular users of Python also use Matplotlib regularly.\n \n21. Some of the popular ML frameworks used regularly are: Scikit-Learn (24%), with Keras and TensorFlow sharing 15% of the responses each.\n     \n     21a. On average, 2 ML frameworks are used regularly.\n     \n     22b. Python and Scikit-Learn are a popular combination with ~2280(48%) of the responses, followed by Python and TensorFlow with ~1430(30%) of the votes.\n     \n22. Linear or Logistic Regression (24%), Decision Tree (20%) and Gradient Boosting (11%) algorithms are the most popular ones with this population.\n     \n     22a. On average 2 ML algorithms are used regularly.\n     \n     22b. Linear or logistic Regression from the Scikit-Learn package is regularly used representing ~1980(41%) of the votes. Decision Tree from Sckit-Learn gets ~1700(36%), and Gradient boosting from Scikit-Learn gets ~1040(22%). Dense neural networks from TensorFlow receives 11% of the share.\n     \n23. Kaggle notebooks (27%) and Google Colab (26%) are the top 2 popular hosted notebooks that are used regularly.\n     \n     23a. On average only 1 hosted notebook is used regularly.\n     \n     23b. Kaggle notebooks, Google Colab, Binder are popular with the young crowd - those with < 5 years of coding experience.\n \n24. Popular media sources for news on Data Science are: Kaggle forums (23%), Blogs (19%), and YouTube (18%).\n     \n     24a. On average respondents use 3 sources regularly to keep themselves uptodate on news in the ML/Data Science space.\n     \n     24b. Within the top 3 media sources, based on years of coding experience, this is what emerges: Kaggle: [<1 years: 33%, 1-2 years: 29%, 3-5 years: 16%], Blogs: [<1 years: 33%, 1-2 years: 30%, 3-5 years: 17%], and YouTube: [<1 years: 34%, 1-2 years: 28%, 3-5 years: 13%]. The share of responses drops for the other coding experience categories.\n     \n     24c. Slicing the data by role title reveals 3 groups: Kaggle: [Students: 34%, Data Scientists: 16%, Software Engineer: 15%], Blogs: [Students: 34%, Data Scientists: 18%, Software Engineers: 15%], and YouTube: [Students: 38%, Data Scientists: 15%, Software Engineers: 15%].\n     \n25. Coursera (21%), Udemy (15%), and Kaggle (13%) received the highest share of responses when it comes to learning platforms online.\n     \n     25a. The average number of courses either begun or completed is 2. \n     \n     25b. The popular groups, based on coding experience, within the popular learning platforms are: Coursera: [<1 years: 29%, 1-2 years: 32%, 3-5 years: 19%], Udemy: [<1 years: 33%, 1-2 years: 31%, 3-5 years: 15%].\n     \n     25c. Based on job titles, they are: Coursera: [Bachelor's: 54%, Master's: 34%, Doctoral: 5%], Udemy: [Bachelor's: 51%, Master's: 36%, Doctoral: 4%].\n     \n \n \n

Majority of these respondents are young, over 80% are \nunder 35 years. The survey is dominated by Males (80%). 48% of respondents claim to have a Bachelor's degree and 35% have a Master's\ndegree. However, the percentage of Doctoral degree holders is abysmally low at 4%; this number for a young country like India is very disheartening. Both public and private infrastructure needs to be improved to encourage students to pursue research. This will help stimulate innovation and growth in the economy. \n\nThe top 3 job titles that participated in the survey are Students (32%), Data Scientists (16%) and Software Engineers (15%). 27% of the Master's degree holders fall in the 22-24 years category. In the same category, Software Engieneers and Statisticians have the highest share of responses at 35% each. Doctoral degree holders have the highest share of responses in the 30-34 years at 35%; this indicates that this section applied for Post doctoral research after acquiring some industry experience.\n\nIn the Business Analysts, Data Scientists, Data Engineers, Data Analysts, DBA's, and Research Scientists categories, most of the respondents are in the 25-29 years range. Research Scientists is the only group that has a representation in all age groups, including 70+ years.\n\nAbout 270 respondents under the age of 35 years are Not employed.India needs to capitalize on its young demographic before it withers away.\n\nAbout 65% of the respondents have less than 5 years of experience in coding at work/school. However, in the 'I have never written code' category, almost 75% of the respondents hold either a Bachelor's or Master's degree. It is imperative to revise the education curriculim to include computing in non-science related fields today as computing helps with automation, data analysis, etc.\n\nThe annual compensation data point was unreliable. But after excluding the missing values and > \\$500K group, and taking the midpoint of the ranges, the mean salary in this population is \\$18K. For Data Scientists, the mean was \\$22K, which is way higher than the average of $14K reported on Glassdoors. The top 3 jobs that will pay you well are: Product/Project Manager, Data Scientist, and Research Scientist.\n\nAround (28%) of the respondents work for large companies of sizes ranging 1000-9,999 employees to > 10,000 employees. Only large companies can affor to have large workloads of 20+ to execute Data science workloads. Software Engineers play an important part in these companies. Machine learning maturity in this population is very low at 10% - this group has established ML methods at work. Not surprisingly, the ML/Cloud spend in the last 5 years is close to \\$10K.\n\nAnother point to note was the presence of unaswered questions. According to Kaggle, the younger the respodent, the fewer the questions shown. As the spending/earning power and experience in this population is on the lower side, relatively speaking, I have ignored about 10 questions, as they are likely to contain a lot of missing values.\n\n59% of the respondents prefer using local environments for programming, and this is popular among all groups with code experience except the 20+ years group, where it is relatively lower. Spreadsheets are popular with those who don't code.\n\nML activities are mostly done by the young workforce, those with less than 5 years of experience in coding. Python is the number 1 language to recommend to anyone interested in a career in Data science. Python is also popular among all groups with code experience except the 20+ years group, where it is relatively lower.\n\nGiven the limited experience, Scikit-learn is popular among the respondents, and simple algorithms like Linear and logistic Regression, Decision Tree are popular; these are used to build prototypes, and gain insight.\n\nHosted notebooks are popular with the young workforce, and these people spend time on Kaggle forums, blogs to learn and grow. Online learning platforms such as Coursera, Udemy, and YouTube are popular for learning new courses.\n\nWhile there are countries in this survey that have an established presence in Data Science/Machine learning, their population is rapidly aging; the young Indian community should be able to pick up the baton, so to speak. For this to happen, they need to be have the relevant skillsets. There is no shortage, today, of courses and data available online. We have to take advantage of these resources such as Kaggle, etc to improve our skills; this will not only make us self-reliant, but find also help us find innovative solutions to pressing problems in agriculture, education, and healthcare.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Next steps"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Build a segmentation model.

Besides, all works that I've already seen are great.Then I decided to answer the questions in a way that I couldn't do in the Survey.\n* Age, gender, country, level education, title, company's size doesn't matter, only coding.\n* How much money spent on ML: I'm retired, just enjoying life while I can. I spent time but I gained Knowledge.\n* Programming language: Python since I can't pretend to code with R.\n* TPU: I barely used GPU in DL micro-course.\n* Years using ML: Are you kidding? In fact, I do Machine Unlearning.\n* NLP: The 1st time I read this I thought that it was about Neuro-linguist Programming and Bert was a character from Sesame street. \n* Cloud computing: only in my user name (wolke=cloud).\n* Big data, I'd rather stay with just data.\n* In fact, that are a lot of questions that I could answer:\"does not apply to me\".\n* I'm not a bot, but my inseparable team mate is. I'd like to ask: Who is the father of the Bot? He rules my world.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print('Thats all Kagglers.

For others it is a dream.\n\nThe myriad global problems are discussed in the world everyday, that I always wonder what are the real issues to talk about. The other day, I was sharing thoughts with a friend. Our conversation started from importance of education and it turned towards impact of inequality in personality development. This is a continuous disturbing thought in my mind. Thus, I decided to discuss it as a major part of my explanatory data analysis and find meaningful insight. This kernel is an attempt to give a motivational thought to those who continuously struggle due to different forms of discrimination. These include age, gender, economy, education and other inequalities. \n\n# 1. Introduction\n\nIn this kernel, I will discuss some important general questions which are hurdles for many, and which usually people ask when they start in any field.\nSince, the data is related to computer science in general, and data science and machine learning in particular, thus, thus I will also mention useful resources to get started in the field of AI.\n\nThe survey received 19,717 responses from 171 countries. 19,717 is a very small sample size to discuss large population and make analysis. Thus, for the justification of my analysis, I will be using other references in addition to Kaggle survey results."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"0f96875d-2ba0-49b2-ae71-1c2ecf6848ea","_cell_guid":"661e88ac-b84f-4889-8a2d-862fc15dc716","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# titl_1: Nothing Can Stop You From Success\n# titl_2: Beat by Compete\n# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom bokeh.plotting import figure\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)  \npd.set_option('display.max_rows', None)  \nPATH = '/kaggle/input/kaggle-survey-2019/'\ndata = pd.read_csv(f'{PATH}multiple_choice_responses.csv', low_memory = False)\ndata.columns = data.iloc[0]\ndata = data.drop([0], axis=0)\nplt.style.use(\"seaborn\")\nsns.set(font_scale=1)\ngender = 'What is your gender? - Selected Choice'\ncountry = 'In which country do you currently reside?'\nsalary = 'What is your current yearly compensation (approximate $USD)?'\nage = 'What is your age (# years)?'\neducation = 'What is the highest level of formal education that you have attained or plan to attain within the next 2 years?'\njob_title = 'Select the title most similar to your current role (or most recent title if retired): - Selected Choice'\n\norder = ['$0-999', '1,000-1,999', '2,000-2,999', '3,000-3,999', '4,000-4,999', '5,000-7,499',\n         '7,500-9,999', '10,000-14,999', '15,000-19,999', '20,000-24,999', '25,000-29,999',\n         '30,000-39,999', '40,000-49,999', '50,000-59,999', '60,000-69,999', '70,000-79,999',\n         '80,000-89,999', '90,000-99,999', '100,000-124,999', '125,000-149,999', '150,000-199,999',\n         '200,000-249,999', '250,000-299,999', '300,000-500,000', '> $500,000']\n\ndata_gender = data[(data[gender]=='Male') | (data[gender]=='Female')]\n\ndata[gender].replace(to_replace={\"Prefer to self-describe\":\"Others\",\n                               \"Prefer not to say\" : \"Others\"}, inplace=True)\ndata_degree = data[(data[education]=='Master’s degree') |(data[education]=='Bachelor’s degree') |(data[education]=='Doctoral degree')];\ndata_1 = data_degree[(data_degree[country]=='India') |(data_degree[country]=='United States of America') | (data_degree[country]=='China')  | (data_degree[country]=='Russia')];\n\ndata.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.

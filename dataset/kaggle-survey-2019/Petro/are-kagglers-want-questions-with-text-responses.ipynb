Change the order of Q12 and 13. A lot of answers about media resources contain answers about platforms.\n2. Add responce `Lecturer\\Teacher` to Q5. \n3. At least `IntelliJ IDEA` and `Eclipse` deserve attention for Q16.\n4. Add `Julia` instead of `TypeScript` for Q19.\n5. Remove text responses for Q21.\n6. Include `svm`, `knn` and `k-means` to responses for Q24.\n\nYou can find my other notebook with the distribution of answers for all Simple and Multiple Choice Questions without Text Responce [here](https://www.kaggle.com/piterfm/kaggle-ml-ds-survey-2019-who-are-kagglers).\n\nThanks for attention!\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

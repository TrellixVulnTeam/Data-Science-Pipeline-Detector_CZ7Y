Introduction\nFor a long time the technology industry has fallen behind other sectors in attracting and employing more diverse people ([link](https://www.cnet.com/news/when-it-comes-to-diversity-techs-idealism-keeps-falling-short/)). In 2018 a forbes arcile quotes: [\"Currently, men hold 76% of technical jobs, and 95% of the tech workforce is white.\"](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lisawinning/2018/03/13/its-time-to-prioritize-diversity-across-tech/#3722945516f8). There have been lots of hopes and expectations that diveristy will increase across all work places, and as a Software Developer myself, I would love this to hold true. \n\nObviously, the Kaggle ML and DS Survey results may not be the data to conduct full and in depth investigation on. However that does not mean there is nothing to learn from the data alongside other sources.\n\nIn this notebook, using the 2019 DS and ML Kaggle Survey and other sources, I will investigate:\n - **Is diverisity increasing or decreasing across the Kaggle community?**\n - **Does this change in diversity correlate with changes in technology trends?** (e.g. popular programming languages, changes in job roles)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.

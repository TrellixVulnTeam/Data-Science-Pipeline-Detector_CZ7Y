The segmented lungs can be further used to find the lung nodule candidates and regions of interest which may help in classification of the CT Scan. Finding the lung nodule regions is a very hard problem because there are nodules that are attached to the blood vessels or at the boundary of the lung region. The lung nodule candidates can be further used for classification by cutting 3D voxels around them and passing it through a 3D CNNs which can be trained on LUNA16 dataset. The LUNA 16 dataset has the location of the nodules in each CT Scan thus will be useful for training the classifier. \n\nIn this tutorial, we will first segment the lungs and then find the region of interest in the CT Scans.\n\nPlease upvote or leave a comment, if you liked the tutorial."},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"73ed7e0f-81ad-5d3d-1b13-7da42212b0b0"},"source":"**Reading a CT Scan**\n-----------------\nEach CT Scan consists of multiple 2D slices which are provided in a DICOM format.

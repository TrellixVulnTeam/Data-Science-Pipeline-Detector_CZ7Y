In this notebook, our goal is to explore the data of these top five countries from different perspective, so that we can get an idea of what's going on in these five countries in the field of Data Scienc.\n\nThis review will help people who are interested in working in these countries as a data science professional or with machine learning. It will help them to know which industries deal more with data science or ML in these countries, in which country the scope to work as a Data Scince professional is more,what tool/technology the use to accomplish thier task etc.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Table of Content\n1.

I wanted to see what industries the data science professionals in these countries are most involved in, what tools / techniques they use to get their work done smoothly and so on. After reviewing the data obtained from the statistics of these five countries, we have got the following information -\n\n1. The top five participating countries  in the '2021 Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey' are India, USA, Japan, China and Brazil. The number of Indian kagglers participating is the highest.\n2. Women's participation is usually far lower than men's in this survey. In Japan, participation of women is less than 10%.\n3. Data Scinece and Machine Learning is more popular in youngsters than among elderly.\n4. The majority of the participants hold a bachelor's or master's degree.\n5. In each country, most participants are involved in the 'Computer/Technology' or 'Academics/Education' industry which is pretty predictable. But Japan is a little different here.In the 'Manufacturing/Fabrication' sector, Japan has adopted ML/DS considerably (23.31%) more than the other four nations.\n6. 'Laptop' and 'Personal computer/ desktop' are still at the top of the list of user favorites.\n7. In these five countries participants are mostly from '0-49 employees','1000-9,999' and '10,000 or more employees' sized companies. In China, 37.24% participants are from '0-49 employees' companies, which is significantly large. Though India and China has a good amount of participants from '0-49 employees' sized companies, this percentage is unsurprising given that these two countries are among the top five freelancing countries. But in China this huge percentage of Data Science and ML professionals only serve their home country as freelancing is not that much popular in China. This distinguishes this country from others. Which brings up the question: is China undergoing a digital transformation, or has one already begun?\n8. Python is extremely popular as a programming language in all five of these contries. SQL,C and C++ are also well-liked in these countries.\n9. Jupyter Notebook is at spike in terms of popularity in these five counties.\n10. Kaggle notebooks and Google Colab are the first choice of Kaggler for hosted notebooks.\n11. The name Matplotlib and Seaborn comes first in the list of users' preferences for data visualization.\n12. As Machine Learning Framework, Scikit-learn,Tensorflow,Keras and PyTorch all are used by Kagglers.\n13. PyTorch is used more frequently in China than in other countries.\n14. As ML algorithm, Linear or Logistic Regression, Decision Tree or Random Forests and Gradient Boosting(xgboost,lightgbm, etc) are popular among Kagglers. Convolution Neural Netwrok, Bayesian Approcahes and Dense Nural Networks are also used by participants.\n15. In India, USA and Brazil AWS, Azure and Google Cloud are side by side in terms of popularity as Cloud Computing platform. But in China Alibaba Cloud and Tencent Cloud are Kagglers favourite.\n16. Kagglers are not yet accustomed to using any Cloud Computing Product. Among the participants Amazon Elastic Computer Cloud(EC2) and Google Cloud Computer Engine are used mostly. Microsoft Azure Virtual Machine is not as much used as Amazon Elastic Computer Cloud(EC2) and Google Cloud Computer Engine.\n17. In four of these countries, Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) has huge popularity except China. In China Google Cloud Storage takes the first position.\n18. The majority of participants do not utilize any managed machine learning product. Amazon SageMaker, Azure Machine Learning Studio, Google Cloud Vertex AI, and Databricks are the most popular managed machine learning tools. However, none of these are widely utilized.\n19. As a Big Data Product MySQL,PostgreSQL and SQLiet are mostly used amon participants. In Japan, about 30% of participants do not utilize any Big Data Product.\n20. In these five countries a significant number of participants do not use any BI tools yet. In Japan and China, this percentage is very high,54.84% and 45.08 %. Among participants Tableau and Microsoft Power BI are used mostly.\n21. The majority of participants have not yet become used to utilizing automated machine learning techniques.\n22. To manage machine learning experiments, participants do not utilize any tools mostly. But among the users TensorBoard and MLflow are quite familiar.\n23. Almost all of the parameters show that India, the United States, and Brazil follow nearly the same path. This is because we may infer that each of these countries is among the top 10 freelancing countries.\n\nThis is all I have been able to collect from this survey of 2021.\n\nThank you for reading!\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}}]}

The survey was live from 09/01/2021 to 10/04/2021, and 25,973 usable responses from participants in 171 different countries and territories are available to generate insights on industry trends, user demographics, popular tools in industry etc.<br>\n\nIn this notebook I set out to understand what are the demographics of the respondents, and comparing the scenario in India and USA.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Top Insights\n\n* Men to Women participation ratio in this survey is 4.21:1\n* 81% of all respondents identify as a Man.\n* Most of the respondents/ say Kaggle users belong to the age group of 25-29 followed by 18-21 years.\n* Proportion of women is very less compared to men in all age group categories.\n* we can see that DS and ML are more popular with women between the age group of 18-29. Where as there are very few DS and ML enthusiasts above 30 years.\n* Most of the women(respondents) belong to the age group of 18-21 and men(respondents) belong to 25-29 years.\n* Though there is not much significant difference between age groups of 18-21 and 25-29 between both genders, nonetheless this poses a question:\n#### Young women showing more interest towards DS and ML?<br>\n* Indian respondents are comparatively younger compared to American respondents.\n* Most of the American respondents are beyoung 30 years.\n#### Young Indians are showing interest in DS and ML compared to young Americans.\n#### 65 and more countries participated in the survey\nThere are some countries where less than 50 respondents participated, such countries are grouped into \"others\"\n#### Representation of Indians in the survey is 2.87 times more compared to Americans. \n* Looks like Kaggle is highly popular amongst Indians. 30% of total responses are from India<br>\n* About 10% of total responses are from USA.<br>\n* One very interesting observation from this graph, there is a growing popularity in DS and ML fields in the developing countries such as India, Brazil, Nigeria etc.\n* The India and United States provided the highest volume of survey responses.\n* The top 15 countries account for almost 70% of all respondents.\n#### There more opportunities for DS and ML fields in Developing countries?\n* Again most of the Women respondents are from India followed by USA.\n* But there is an emerging community of Women from Egypt, Uk and Nigeria.\n* Participation from Japan and China is more in Men than in Women\n* Many Kaggle users are holding a Master's Degree or Bachelor's Degree. This is observed holds valid for both Men and Women of Kaggle community.\n* Most of the Indian responders are holding Bachelor's degree, while most of the American resonders are holding either Master's degree or Doctoral degree.\n* Based on the age group it can be assumed that many are contributing to Kaggle, exploring and build models, participating in Kaggle competitions to gain exposure or to build a profile in DS and ML files.\n* This can be with an intention to pursue Masters Degree or up-skilling and moving to DS and ML fields in pursuit of new roles and jobs.\n#### It is safe say that Kaggle helping Students and job-seekers to gain exposure in DS and ML fileds.\n* Most responses are from students and they are from India.\n* Amongst students proportion of women is more than that of Men.\n* Men are already holding positions in data science, data analyst or software fields in comparison to women responders.\n* Proportion of American responders in Data Scientist and Data Analyst roles is more than Indian responders.\n* Since the USA is having established tech hubs, the proportion of DS and ML is more in various other fields compared to India.\n* There are other fields in USA who are benefiting from Kaggle.\n#### Responders from which other fields such as Medical, Automotive or Startups are prominent on Kaggle from USA .\nOur assumptions based on the plots of formal education strengthen the fact that, Kaggle is helping students and job seekers to work with data, learn new concepts, gain knowledge, participate in competitions and gain exposure which is required to pursue higher education or seek a role or a new job.<br>\n* Many women responders have been coding since 1-3 years or less.\n* Men have more coding experience compared women respondents.\n* Almost equal proportion of men and women have coding experience for 3-5 years.\n* Twice as many men have 20+ years of experience than women.\n#### Looks like India is getting started with coding and programming.\n* Many American responders have more than 5 years of programming experience.\n* Proportion of Americans who have 20+years of programming is 5 times more than Indians. \n* Less than 5% of American respondents have never written a code.\n* Respondents with more programming experience have more salary.\n* Majority of those who are earning more than 1,00,000 USD in Yearly compensation have more than 5 years of coding experience.\n* responders with 20+years earn more than 2,00,000 USD.\n#### About 20% of responders are having 20+years of experience are drawing more than 10,00,000 USD.\n#### Computers/Technology and Academics/Education industry are the most popular.\n* Third most popular Industry is Accounting/Finance but it is about half as popular as Academics/Education industry.\n* Academics/Education and Computers/Technology are popular industries among women.\n* Proportion of women in Computers/Technology industry about 3% less compared to Men.\n* Women responders working in Computers/Technology industry is three times than that of Accounting/Finance.\n* Proportion of responders from India in Computers/Technology industry twice as much as Academics/Education industry.\n* Accounting/Finance, Medical/Pharmaceutical, Government/Public Service are other popular industries among responders in USA.\n* Representation from Hospitality/Entertainment/Sports industry is the least.\n* Except for Computers/Technology industry which is highly popular among Indian responders, other industries are relatively popular among Americans. \n#### It is likely that most Indian Kaggle users are working in Computers/Technology Industry.\n#### About 41% of respondents were not comfortable disclosing their current yearly compensation\n* Majority of women responders are drawing 0-999 USD as yearly compensation.\n* Proportion of Men is more than women as the salary-band is increasing.\n#### There is definite pay gap between men and women responders.\n* Indian reponders are having lesser pay compared to US counterparts.\n#### There is definite pay difference between Indian and American responders.\n* Majority of Americans are earning anywhere between 100000-200000 USD.\n* There are very few Indian responders who are drawing higher salaries.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Importing Libraries\nThis notebook is using following

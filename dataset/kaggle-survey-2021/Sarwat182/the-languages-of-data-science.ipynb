It takes its roots from statistics, mathematics and computer science; its branches spread towards nearly every field. Whichever way you look at it, data science is a juggernaut indeed.\n\nBut everything begins with a base, a foundation, a first step. One of the most important bases of data science is computer programming, that critical skill which allows us to work with massive amounts of data. Programming, in turn, begins with languagesâ€“ programming languages, that is. There are countless programming languages around; some are ubiquitous, others obsolete. Aspiring data scientists are often daunted by the thought of where to begin. A popular language choice is Python, but is it the only one? Is R a better choice? How many languages does a data scientist need anyway? \n\nIn this notebook, I will look at the languages that Kagglers use. Though Kagglers are a wide and varied bunch, they represent a vibrant community of current and aspiring data scientists. Taking a look at their language choices would give a good idea of the languages in vogue today. Also, I will be using Python, as *my* language of choice.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Importing the data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The first thing to do is to import the relevant libraries, and the dataset.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# importing the relevant libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-28T11:03:23.004992Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-28T11:03:23.005553Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-28T11:03:23.009729Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-28T11:03:23.005508Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-28T11:03:23.008883Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# importing the kaggle dataset\ndf = pd.read_csv('../input/kaggle-survey-2021/kaggle_survey_2021_responses.csv', header = 1)","metadata":{"scrolled":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-28T11:03:23.01105Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-28T11:03:23.011434Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-28T11:03:24.08771Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-28T11:03:23.011395Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-28T11:03:24.086764Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## The size of the dataset","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The first thing we do is look at what the dataframe has to present to us.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-28T11:03:24.089637Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-28T11:03:24.090153Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-28T11:03:24.118495Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-28T11:03:24.090108Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-28T11:03:24.117475Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print('The Kaggle 2021 survey dataset has {} rows and {} columns.

However, users of C and C++ have the largest number of students (>40%) while Bash and Swift have the least (~15%). Around 25% of Python users and ~20% of R and SQL users are students. A detailed breakdown is as follows:\n\n**Python users**, ~28% are students, ~15% are data scientists, followed by ~8% of both software engineers and data analysts. Occupations such as business analyst, product manager and research scientist make up <10% of Python usersâ€™ occupations. \n\n**R users**, 22% are students, 21% data scientists, and 13% data analysts. Only ~3% are software engineers, a remarkably low number compared to Python users. This, coupled with the differences in the numbers of data scientists and analysts between the two languages, highlights the fact that R is possibly â€˜theâ€™ language for data science. Other occupations make up <10% of R users.\n\n**SQL users**, the percentages are more evenly spread amongst students, data scientists, data analysts and software engineers (~13-19%).\n\n**C, C++, Java and Javascript users**: A good look at the table tells us that data scientists and data analysts make up <10% of their users; the largest numbers of Kagglers who use them regularly are students (>40% for C and C++, to 26% for Javascript), followed by software engineers (ranging from 11% to 23%). This lends credence to the position that these are more software languages than data ones.\n\n**Julia users**: Students make 20% of its users. Of the rest, ~18% are data scientists, and 16% research scientists, implying that Julia might be used more in research-work. Other occupations, including data analysts, software engineers, data engineers etc, make up only handfuls, with each occupation contributing to <10% of the total.\n\n**Swift users**: Software engineers make up the highest percentage of Swift users, at 26%. 14% are students, and ~10% are in â€˜otherâ€™ industries. Of the named occupations, however, none make more than 10% of the total, though data scientists are at the higher side of the scale at 9.9%.\n\n**Bash users**: 19% are data scientists, 16% software engineers, and 13% students. An interesting thing to note is that research scientist and machine learning engineer rank relatively highly (at 9.7% and 9.1% respectively).\n\n**MATLAB users**: After students (33%), research scientists make up the greatest proportion of its users at ~13%. Data scientists make 11% of its users, while the other named occupations are <10%.\n\n**None**: People who use no programming language regularly are either students (18%) or do â€˜otherâ€™ jobs (27%). Of the rest, 16.9% are unemployed and 10% are data analysts. The other occupations make <10% of the total number of users; data scientists and software engineers make, respectively, 1.5% and 2% of the total.\n\n**Others**: Kagglers who use other languages regularly are mostly either software engineers (23%), students (~12%), in â€˜otherâ€™ jobs (12%) or data analysts (~10%).

**Figure 8** little less than 40% (exact percentages range from 32-36%) of **Python, SQL, R, C, C++, Java, Javascript and MATLAB** users either do not know or have not had machine learning methods employed in their place of work; taken in conjunction with **Figure 7** above, we can assume that these are either those working in data analysis, or the very  few whose activities are not represented in the data. Users of **Julia** and **Bash** are least likely to not use machine learning methods, with only ~20% of **Julia users** and ~21% of **Bash users** saying that they do not know or use them. More than 60% of Kagglers who do not use any language do not know/use any machine learning methods, in comparison to 40% of those who use other languages.\n\nAround a quarter (~25%) of **C, C++, Java, Javascript and MATLAB** users work in businesses which are exploring machine learning methods; 22% of **Python users, 21% R users, 20% SQL users and 19.5% Julia users**  work in similar businesses. Percentages are similar across the board for businesses that have recently started using machine learning methods; in contrast, 26% of **Julia users** and 28% of **Bash users** work in businesses that have already established machine learning methods. \n\nThis trend is reflected in the usersâ€™ machine learning experiences as well. Going by **Figure 9** and the associated data, we can see that only around 5% of Julia users do not use ML methods, and 19% have used them for less than a year;  taken together, only \\~23% of Julia users are â€˜newâ€™ to machine learning. A greater number of **Bash** users (~9%) do not use ML, a little less than the 10.9% of **MATLAB**, 12.8% of **Python**, 11.9% of **R**, and 12.3% of **Swift** users. Users of **C, C++, Java and Javascript** who do not use ML hover in the same range - ~16%. 41.5% of **C users**, ~39% of **Python, C++ and Java users**, ~36% of **SQL and Javascript users** and 31% of **R users** have been using machine learning methods for <1 year. \n\nAfter this, the percentages spread out somewhat evenly again across the different languages; beyond the one year mark, **C, C++, Java, Javascript** and, surprisingly, **Python** users are in the 40-50% range, **R and MATLAB** users are in the 50-60% range, and **Julia** users make 76.5% of users who use machine learning methods.\n\nIn short, it seems that Kagglers who use **Julia, and to a lesser extent MATLAB and Bash users** are the ones who have the greatest experience using machine learning methods.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Overall programming experience","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"But machine learning experience isnâ€™t the only kind of experience a data scientist have; first, they must haveexperience in coding **Figure 10** shows us the years of experience the users of different languages have.

Amongst them, SQL users are more likely to be in data analytics; they are also more likely to be in field of Accounting or Finance. Python users  are by contrast more likely to be working in computers/technology, with their work geared more towards data science and data engineering. R users are more likely to be in â€˜hardâ€™ data analytics, with equal numbers in academics, finance and technology.\n- C, C++, Java and Javascript are languages whose users are more likely to be in software engineering and related disciplines; they are also more likely to be students and those learning programming and data science. While their users work in businesses/jobs that employ machine learning methods, it could be that they use other languages in addition to these four in their work.\n- Swift's users tend to be into software engineering as well. However, the users of Swift are more likely to be older and more experienced, and much less likely to be students. They are also more likely to be using or employed in businesses using machine learning.\n- Julia and Bash appear to be languages for more experienced programmers, and those deeply into data science. Very few of their users do not use machine learning; they are the least likely to be students. Users of Julia are more likely to be in research.\n- MATLAB are also likely to be more into machine learning than analytics. However, a higher percentage of them tend to be students, meaning that the language is more likely to be taught earlier in aspiring data scientists.\n- The recommended language for new data scientists to learn is overwhelmingly Python, with fewer suggestions for SQL and R.

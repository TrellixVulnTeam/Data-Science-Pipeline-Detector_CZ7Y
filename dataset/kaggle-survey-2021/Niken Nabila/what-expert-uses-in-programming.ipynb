Human resources are required to learn new skills in order to compete in an industrial environment. One of the most important skill to learn is programming skills. People who want to start learning about programming often get confused because there are a lot of languages, notebooks, and hardware that can be used in programming.\n\nIn this notebook, we will discuss the languages, notebooks, and hardware used and recommended by people who have experience in writing programs using the results of Kaggle 2021 survey. We assume that non-experts are people who have programming experience less than 5 years and experts are people who have programming experience from 5 to 20

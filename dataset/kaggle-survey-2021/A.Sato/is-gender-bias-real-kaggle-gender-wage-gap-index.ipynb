What I want to do in this notebook\n\nGender bias is one of the most frequently discussed topics that attracts much attention. As is well known, the number of female Kagglers is far smaller than that of males, and the average wage of women is fewer than that of men.\n\n**What is NOT answered yet by other notebooks** is whether the gender bias is systematic or not.Men dominating this field is not necessarily a problem if this is the result of freedom to choose the profession. No one can force women to be data scientists. Also, you can name other fields that are dominated by women. Moreover, the wage gap is reasonable if the gap can be explained by other factors such as education or working experiences. \n\nHowever, if women are paid less than men with the same level of education, working experience, and position, all of us can agree that there is a systematic bias against women. This is my primary interest . \n\nIn this notebook, I will explore and try to answer this question: **'Is there a systematic gender bias regarding wages? If so, in which country is that bias more severe?'**  \n\n**Most other notebooks are preoccipied with visualization with simple aggregation but you cannot conclude that there is a systematic bias by just looking at the mean/median wage difference between women and men. You need to control for other variables that might affect wages.**\n\nMy simple but rigorous approach is as follows. Section 1 describes the data cleaning process to extract reliable subsamples from the dataset. Section 2 visualizes the gender difference from many aspects including the median wage. Section 3 explains the result of gender gap estimation. Section 4 is the conclusion including suggestions.\n\nHope this is insightful and thought-provoking!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1.

Focusing on the currently employed**\n\nAs my interest is a wage gap, students and those who are not employed are excluded.\n\n**2. Focusing on Women/Men**\n\nTo gauge the wage gap between women and men, I selected the respondents whose gender identity was either woman or man.\n\n**3. Selecting the countries whose number of women's responses is 20 or more.**\n\nComparing responses from different countries (i.e. comparing Chinese women with American men) is misleading. Wages are denominated by USD but the level of general price differ across countries to a great extent. Therefore, I decided to compare within the respective countries by using median wages of that country. Making a reliable statistical comparison needs at least 20 women's responses in each country.\n\n**4. Excluding implausible wages**\n\nSome wage answers do not seem to be true. Some responses were below the minimum wage of that country, which is highly unlikely. Perhaps, people misunderstood the question or simply did not want to disclose their wages. Other responses were unrealistically high. These might actually be outliers but some of them should be just liars'. I decided to exclude responses indicating that wages were either below the minimum wage of the country or above five times the median wage of the country (calculated after excluding the responses lower than the minimum wage).\n\n**5. Re-counting women's responses and re-selecting countries**\n\n**6. Excluding countries whose median wage is less than USD 2,000.**\n\nThe smallest bin width of wages is USD 500 so you cannot assess wages in the low range. (i.e. all USD 700, USD 800, and USD 900 go into USD500 - USD999 bucket even though they are fairly different.)

Conclusion","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In this notebook, I estimated **the Kaggle Gender-Wage Gap Index** and examined the gender bias in the data science community. The main findings are as follows.\n\n* Women's wages are lower than men by 20% of median wage. This gap cannot be attributed to other factors such as education, job title, and working experience. Gender bias against women regarding wages is **REALLY EXISTS**.\n\n* By country, Canada, Brazil, USA, and Germany have the largest gaps while China and Nigeria do not have any gaps. \n\n* The countries which achieve higher overall gender equality have a larger wage gap in the machine learning sector.\n\nNeedless to say, this result is not final and further research should be conducted to confirm the result. Methodology-wise, the Kaggle survey is not solely designed to research this topic. \n\nMoreover, the **core question** remains to be answered. The result is somewhat counterintuitive. Especially, the Kaggle Gender-Wage Gap is negatively correlated with WEI's gender gap index. Why is the gender gap in the machine learning field different from the overall gender gap? Before I started this experiment, I supposed that Japan (my country, which historically has poor performance in terms of gender equality measured by international institutions) should have larger bias than the US but the result indicates the opposite. Digging into this point might help help us to find the ways to tackle gender wage gap in the data science.\n\nMy **suggestion for the next survey** is to ask about wages in a more tactical manner. Wage responses are rather noisy. For example, multiple choices instead of raw numbers might be helpful to get more reliable responses. In addition, using the minimum wage of a country as a threshold can help people avoid answering unrealistically low wages.\n\n**Thank you for reading my notebook! I hope that my findings are interesting and thought-provoking. I would love to hear/learn from your opinions/observations at your country about this issue.**","metadata":{}}]}

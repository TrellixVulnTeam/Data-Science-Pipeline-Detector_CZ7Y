The visualizations that are of interest listed down below, and there will be headers referring to these visualizations respectively.\n\n\n1. Influence of Gender on Salary\n2. Job Distribution with respect to Gender\n3. Age Group distribution in Various Job Positions\n4. Average Salary changes with respect to Age Group\n4. Average Salary with respect to education level\n6. Average Salary trend with respect to Coding Experience\n7. No. of language vs Wage\n8. No. of visualization vs Wage \n8. No. of ML_framework \n8. No. of Learning resources vs wage\n\n\n### 1.1.1 Glossary\n\nFor the sake of easier discussion, the term \"salary\" will be used to refer to phrases such as \"wage\", \"compensation\". In this report, the term \"Data Workers\",for lack of a better term, will be used as a broader term to include all of the different job scopes, such as data scientists, data analysts, data engineers ... etc. ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.2 Data Cleaning\n\nWe will first need to clean the data, and transform the data in a form that is easier to work with.

The user count is 242, 305 and 2216 respectively. \n\nIt might be due to the scarcity of the users in these languages that warrant such a high salary. Something to note is that in this visualization, although it is being categorized in each language, the language known is not limited to 1 language only.

It is highly possible, that these users are also well versed in more common frameworks and tools. \n\nComing back to ML frameworks, it can be seen that there is a even more clear trend of increasing salary for knowing 1-11 ML frameworks. After 11 frameworks, the trend is not clear.\n\n# 2.10 Learning Platforms\n\nLast but not least, I would like to explore the learning platforms and their association with salary. Let us proceed to the visualizations.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"learning_average_salary = {}\nlearning_average_salary['learning_platform'] = []\nlearning_average_salary['salary'] = []\nlearning_average_salary['count'] = []\n\n\nfor platform in learning_cols:\n    temp = df[df[platform] == 1]\n    learning_average_salary['learning_platform'].append(platform)\n    learning_average_salary['salary'].append(temp.compensation.mean())\n    learning_average_salary['count'].append(temp.compensation.count())\n\n\ntemp = pd.DataFrame(data=learning_average_salary)\n\npx.bar(temp, x='learning_platform', y=['salary','count'],barmode='group',title='Average Salary of Each Learning Platform')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-30T17:17:41.960239Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-30T17:17:41.96046Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-30T17:17:42.073082Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-30T17:17:41.960434Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-30T17:17:42.072046Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"temp = df.groupby(by='learning_sum').mean()\n\nfig = px.bar(temp, x=temp.index, y='compensation',title='No. of Learning Platform used vs Average Salary')\nfig.update_layout(xaxis_title='No. Of Learning Platform Used', yaxis_title='Average Salary')\nfig","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-30T17:17:42.074652Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-30T17:17:42.074989Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-30T17:17:42.165355Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-30T17:17:42.074948Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-30T17:17:42.164405Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It can be seen that fast.ai, edX and udacity learners have higher salaries. This is an interesting finding, because fast.ai and edX are free/semi-free learning platforms, while udacity is one of the more expensive learning platforms available. They represent 2 extremes in terms of pricing. \n\nFrom our second visualization showing the effects of No. of Learning platform used on salary, there is but one especially interesting finding and encouraging finding. There is a clear difference between users who do learn ( any value > 1) and users who do not. \n\nHowever, more learning platforms is not necessarily more beneficial towards increasing your salary. This is natural, as more learning platforms don't mean that you learn more. Learners will probably benefit more, by having a higher level of focus and dedication on one or two platforms that provide quality learning content, rather than having more learning platforms.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 3.0 Conclusion\n\n\nThrough the various visualizations that we have explored in this notebook, all of the findings are converged in the list below:\n\n1. No obvious wage gap exists due to gender\n2. No particular job position has any gender biases. However, with a lower male-female ratio in students, we should be able expect this lower male-female ratio to trickle to workplaces as time goes by, narrowing the gender gap.\n3. Participants Aged 45 and below make up the majority of this survey, and in turn, a significant portion of the data community.\n4. There is **an increasing trend of salary from age 22 --> 45**.\n5. There is a salary gap between bachelor's degree and master's degree, and another gap between master's degree and doctorates. There is no siginificant difference between other education levels, from high school all the way up to bachelor's degree.\n6. There is a clear, increasing trend of salary with increasing coding experience.\n7. There are not one language that can be confirmed to warrant higher pay, and there is no trend that suggests higher salary is associated with knowing more no. of languages.\n8. On the other hand, knowing more data visualization libraries, does have a clear increasing trend in salary. This increasing trend is obvious in for knowing 2-7 data visualization libraries.\n9. The same can be said for ML frameworks, with a clear increase of salary from knowing 1 - 11 ML frameworks.\n10. Users who do use learning platforms do have higher salaries than users who do not. However, there is no correlation between using more learning platforms and salary.\n\n\nPlease leave your comments down below to let me know where this notebook can be improved.

In this notebook we will explore the results of the 2021 Kaggle Machine Learning (ML) & Data Science (DS) Survey.\n\n#### Every year since 2017, Kaggle has conducted its annual ML and DS survey, an  industry-wide pulse of practitioners of machine learning and data science. The survey asks respondents a variety of questions about their age, gender, country of residence, role and algorithms of choice, to name a few. \n\n#### This survey is publicly available for analysis and a competition is held annually to showcase participants data storytelling skills using the survey data. The 2021 survey was live from 9/1/2021 to 10/04/2021 and includes responses from 25,973 individuals from 171 countries and territories!\n\n## Step 1: Business Understanding\n\n#### As we dive into the data, we'll focus on the following questions:\n- Which countries had respondents from the Accounting/Finance industry? How do these countries rank in their respective percentage of respondents who work in the Accounting/Finance indstry?\n-  What ML and DS roles do accounting and finance professionals work in? What programming languages do they prefer and what algorithms are most popular?\n- What is the gender profile of all survey respondents and how does the Accounting/Finance industry rank among all other industries in the percentage of respondents who identify as woman, non-binary or something else?\n\n#### A final note before we proceed: As we will see, the data used in this observational analysis is limited to the respondents of the Kaggle survey, is demonstrably skewed and may not be representative of data scientists in the Accounting/Finance industry overall. Nonetheless, it may provide some insight into this cross-section of the professions.\n\n### With that, let's begin!","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# load necessary packages\nimport warnings\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport geopandas\nfrom geopandas import plotting\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib as mpl\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.ticker as mtick\nfrom mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1 import make_axes_locatable\n\n%matplotlib inline\nplt.rcParams['figure.dpi'] = 110\nplt.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = (16,10)\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-25T11:20:57.2359Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-25T11:20:57.236438Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-25T11:20:57.873387Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-25T11:20:57.236346Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-25T11:20:57.872542Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Step 2: Data Understanding & Preparation","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Read in the survey data\nsurvey_df = pd.read_csv('../input/kaggle-survey-2021/kaggle_survey_2021_responses.csv')\nsurvey_df.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-25T11:20:57.875465Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-25T11:20:57.875889Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-25T11:20:59.067786Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-25T11:20:57.875845Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-25T11:20:59.066858Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Looks like we need to remove the first row, which describes each question\ndata_dictionary = dict(survey_df.iloc[0])\nsurvey_df = survey_df.drop([0]).reset_index(drop=True)\nsurvey_df.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-25T11:20:59.069007Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-25T11:20:59.069255Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-25T11:20:59.32201Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-25T11:20:59.069224Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-25T11:20:59.321138Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(f'The data set consists of {survey_df.shape[0]} respondents and {survey_df.shape[1]} fields')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-25T11:20:59.323248Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-25T11:20:59.323951Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-25T11:20:59.330746Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-25T11:20:59.323918Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-25T11:20:59.329841Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Let's check for missing data with regard to question #3: \"In which country do you currently reside?\"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data_dictionary['Q3']","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-25T11:20:59.332794Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-25T11:20:59.333541Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-25T11:20:59.34422Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-25T11:20:59.333507Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-25T11:20:59.343365Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"print(f\"There are {survey_df['Q3'].isna().sum()} missing responses for question #3, country of residence.\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-25T11:20:59.345437Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-25T11:20:59.345656Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-25T11:20:59.356393Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-25T11:20:59.345629Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-25T11:20:59.355801Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Great, all survey participants responded with their country of residence.

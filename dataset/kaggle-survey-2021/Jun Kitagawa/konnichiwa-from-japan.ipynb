Develop the ability to solve problems by building simple algorithms. In Russia, it seems that the emphasis is on algorithm education in ICT learning. The goal of learning is to develop the algorithmic thinking necessary to perform professional work in modern society, and to acquire the skills to create algorithms as one of the problem-solving methods.|\n|UK|2014|IIn 1995, \"IT\" was established as a compulsory independent subject in the primary and secondary education stages. In 1999, I changed the subject name to \"ICT\" and mainly learned how to operate computers and use applications. The turning point came around 2010. It is pointed out by the government and industry that although you can use writing software and spreadsheet software, it is not a subject to learn what you can do with a computer. Therefore, in 2012, the Ministry of Education reviewed the learning content of the \"ICT\" subject, changed the subject name to \"Computing\", and made primary education compulsory in 2014. In \"Computing\", instead of simply \"using\" computer operations as in the past, the learning content has changed to thinking about procedures for solving problems and setting the programming language to \"learning\".|\n|Japan|2020|[[Coding will be mandatory in Japan's primary schools from 2020]](https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Coding-will-be-mandatory-in-Japan-s-primary-schools-from-2020)  |","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"Age = KS2021.groupby('Age').count()\nAgeJapan = KS2021[KS2021['Country']=='Japan'].groupby('Age').count()\nAgeIndia = KS2021[KS2021['Country']=='India'].groupby('Age').count()\nAgeRussia = KS2021[KS2021['Country']=='Russia'].groupby('Age').count()\nAgeUK = KS2021[KS2021['Country']=='UK'].groupby('Age').count()\n\nf, axes = plt.subplots(1,4, figsize=(25, 10), sharex=True)\nf.tight_layout()\nf = sns.barplot(data=AgeIndia, x=AgeIndia.index,y='Time from Start to Finish (seconds)', ax=axes[0])\nf.set_title('India')\nf.set_ylabel(\"Count\")\nf = sns.barplot(data=AgeRussia, x=AgeRussia.index,y='Time from Start to Finish (seconds)', ax=axes[1])\nf.set_title('Russia')\nf.set_ylabel(\"Count\")\nf = sns.barplot(data=AgeUK, x=AgeUK.index,y='Time from Start to Finish (seconds)', ax=axes[2])\nf.set_title('UK')\nf.set_ylabel(\"Count\")\nf = sns.barplot(data=AgeJapan, x=AgeJapan.index,y='Time from Start to Finish (seconds)', ax=axes[3])\nf.set_title('Japan')\nf.set_ylabel(\"Count\")\nf.set_xticks([0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10])","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":false,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-28T01:06:16.47856Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-28T01:06:16.478786Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-28T01:06:18.707633Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-28T01:06:16.478759Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-28T01:06:18.706895Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In Japan, Kagglers between age of 18-24 is lower than the other countries.  \nI think the reason is that many people are learning programming for the first time in college.(So was I)   \n \nBut, programming education for elementary schools became mandatory in 2020 in Japan.  \n[[Coding will be mandatory in Japan's primary schools from 2020]](https://asia.nikkei.com/Economy/Coding-will-be-mandatory-in-Japan-s-primary-schools-from-2020)  \nBy increasing the chances of learning programming from an early stage, I think more people will challenge Kaggle.     \n\nIndia, which introduced programming education in 2005, and Russia, which introduced it in 2009, have a high percentage of Kaggler aged 18 to 24.   \nIn the UK and Japan, the proportion of young Kaggler will increase in the next few years, as in India and Russia.","metadata":{}}]}

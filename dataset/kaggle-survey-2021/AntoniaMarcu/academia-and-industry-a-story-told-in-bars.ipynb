That means that I am once again faced with an important decision: where to from here? \n\nI really like academia so I was quite determined to do a postdoc but an initial search left me very disappointed. Most of the programs out there are very... applied, whereas I am studying the theory of generalisation. I then started wondering what caused my disappointment and I realised the professional isolation of the pandemic has caused me to submerge even further in a bubble; a bubble of theoretical research where I started losing the notion of application. Sure, all my research was conducted having in mind the contributions to the community. But I was treating the community as a rather abstract and distant notion instead of a vibrant and constantly changing entity. So I wanted to find out: who are the people applying ML? Does a real disconnection between researchers and practitioners exist and if so, how does that affect the two? Setting out to answer these questions has changed my perspective and made me both aware of issues I knew deep down existed but didn't take the time to reflect on, as well as biases I was ignorant about. In this notebook I'll walk you through a condensed version of my quest and share with you the most important things I've learned.\n\nSo. *How relevant is academia for the Machine Learning industry and vice versa?* This is the question we‚Äôll try to explore today through the eyes of the Kaggle community.\n\nI will focus on the story, using mostly bar plots to illustrate the points made. We start by trying to understand who is using what technologies. Is the latest academic research of relevance to the field or is industry leading? In the quest to answer these questions we discover some less evident truths this data set contains. I hope that this story is going to remind the academic community that it is important to be more aware of who are the people using their research, while encouraging Kaggle and the industry as a whole to value academic work more.\n\nAfter reading this, the insights you'll gain and my associated suggestions are: \n* By far the most used algorithms by the Kaggle community are classic ones. I believe Kaggle could 1. propose challenges that implicitly entail a larger variety of algorithms and 2. encourage integration of the latest research; \n* Biases in the data collection process shape the stories that emerge from the data. A community-aware methodology could lead to more insightful stories;\n* Researchers from both academia and industry might be more state of the art results-oriented. Reporting results on unautomated settings as well could be more relevant for the wider community.\n\nWe start with some general statistics. This is for us to set the context and get familiar with the broad pool of respondents. As I have said and will reemphasise throughout the notebook, the answers are not necessarily representative of the broader population so we have to first understand whom this data talks about.\n\nWe‚Äôll skip over the graphs to keep things short but have a look for yourself if you want to. Overall, we have an overwhelming number of students, yet only 18.79% of the respondents took an ML University Course. Most of the respondees have little ML experience but we are largely dealing with people who hold or will hold a Master‚Äôs or Bachelor's degree.

I plotted for us the usage of Linear/Logistic Regression per ML experience category. We can observe that more experienced Kagglers prefer these methods as much as beginners.\n\nPerhaps the number of Kaggle competitions for which one would use GANs or Transformers is not so big. But at the same time, a very small population declared they use any other algorithms apart from the few that were listed.\nIs then the research disconnected from real-world usages of algorithms? Sure, achieving incremental improvements on the same 5 consecrated data sets is fun but shouldn‚Äôt we try to demonstrate our algorithms are better by *showing they are successful on more realistic data sets? Kaggle is a great source of freely available data, which researchers should exploit more*. On the other hand, the extensive usage of classical algorithms amongst Kagglers could underline a possible area of improvement. I believe Kaggle challenges can encourage competitors to use newer technologies by both the nature of their challenges as well as the way solutions are evaluated. Regarding the latter, I believe *Kaggle could actively support the community to discover new research by rewarding those who incorporate it in their solutions*.\n\nIt is important to remember that this data talks about *algorithm* usage and does not reflect the overall engagement of the Kaggle community with novel research. It is in this area that the data tells us we could improve the cooperation between researchers and appliers.\n\nYou may ask: Why should we try new technologies if old ones work just fine? I think that's how we advance as a field.  Undoubtedly, every new data set comes with its own challenges, and mastering the application of classical methods to new problems is very important. But  I think the Kaggle community is a hive mind that has great potential to broaden its collective knowledge by exploring newly proposed algorithms, rather than going for the \"safe bet\". Sure, while some methods will significantly improve results, others will not work so well in real-world scenarios. But it is important that we experiment with them and communicate what works and what doesn't. This would in turn provide \"feedback\" to researchers which can get a reality check and improve their methods so that they become better when applied in practice. A win-win situation I'd say.

To the question ‚ÄúSelect any activities that make up an important part of your role at work‚Äù none of the PhD students replied, although ‚ÄúDo research that advances the state of the art of machine learning‚Äù would definitely suit the first category, while ‚ÄúBuild prototypes to explore applying machine learning to new areas‚Äù fits the second.\n\nThe first thought was that there must be an error in the data collection process. Perhaps students were not asked the work-related questions. I quickly went and checked the ‚Äòkaggle_survey_2021_answer_choices.pdf‚Äô. The purpose of this document is for us to see the answer choices and which questions were asked to which respondents. I found to my surprise that it was not stated anywhere that students could not answer these questions.\n\nSo I thought: PhD students don‚Äôt consider their work as... well... work? There could be an implicit bias in the data caused by the order in which questions were answered. This could have caused the students to believe the question was specifically addressed to people who are employed in industry. However, none of the 294 PhD students felt the question was including them. Absolute zero is suspicious, but that‚Äôs what the data shows. I suddenly remembered that I overheard my dad saying to his friends that by doing a PhD I was prolonging my childhood. Or my friends who although they knew I was halfway through my PhD asked me if I got a job when I said I started working from home. Or my brother who keeps pushing me to drop my PhD and ‚Äúget a real job‚Äù. Sure, the (lack of) answers could‚Äôve been influenced by the tone of the previous questions. But perhaps there is something else at play. I triple-check the ‚Äúwhich questions were asked to whom‚Äù file just to be sure.\n\nA few days later the following sentences in the methodology file caught my attention: ‚ÄúRespondents with the most experience were asked the most questions. For example, students and unemployed persons were not asked questions about their employer‚Äù. Right. So probably that means they were not asked questions about their work at all, not just the ones about the employer per se. This is conflicting with the ‚Äò‚Äôanswer choices‚Äù file, but it's the most likely scenario. \n\nUltimately, it is irrelevant. Regardless of which is the truth, we draw two important insights:\n\n1. Data does not only speak about its population, but also about its collectors. What are the things we as data collectors are interested in? What are our biases? How do they affect the story our data tells?\n2. Being a PhD student means you‚Äôre neither here nor there. Yes, you can have a paid 9 to 5 contract, like any other full-time worker, but it‚Äôs quite possible that others don‚Äôt consider you are actually ‚Äúworking‚Äù. I‚Äôm looking forward for a study of how this affects the self-perception of PhD students and if there is any link with the reported poor mental health. Until then, feast yourself with some memes on the subject.\n\n\nSo where were we?\nAutomation... yes, right.\nWe wanted to understand the usage of automation tools of the entire community of ML researchers (including ML PhDs). \nUnfortunately, because we don‚Äôt have the activity that makes part of doctoral students' work we cannot distinguish between PhD student who simply want to apply ML to their areas of study and ML PhD students (those who research ML subjects). This is important since we expect their answers to differ quite significantly. \n\n(CAVEAT. STRONG ASSUMPTION INCOMING) Let‚Äôs see if we can identify them by the number of years of experience in ML. That means we are implicitly assuming ML PhD students are more likely to have some ML background.

But maybe when proposing a new algorithm it would be worth reporting on how it compares to other methods in unoptimised settings as well.\nAn important observation here is that we considered ML PhD students to be the ones with more experience. What if our conclusion was drawn hastily and ML experience is actually the one making a difference. Let's apply the same experience-wise separation for all the respondents of the question.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"Q_36_Columns = [x for x in df.columns if 'Q36_B' in x]\nrole_experience = df[['Q15'] + Q_36_Columns]\n\n# segregate according to experience\nnovices = role_experience[role_experience['Q15'] == 'Under 1 year']\nexperienced = role_experience[(role_experience['Q15']=='2-3 years')| (role_experience['Q15']=='3-4 years') | (role_experience['Q15']=='4-5 years')| (role_experience['Q15']=='5-10 years')]\n\n# plot interest in automation according to experience\nax = sns.barplot(x=novices.count()[Q_36_Columns]/novices.shape[0], y=automation_methods, color='blue', alpha=0.5, label=\"novice\")\nax = sns.barplot(x=experienced.count()[Q_36_Columns]/experienced.shape[0], y=automation_methods, color='red', alpha=0.5, label=\"experienced\" )\nplt.legend()\nplt.xlim(0,1)\nplt.ylabel(\"automation method\")\nplt.xlabel(\"percentage of interested respondents\")\nplt.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-28T17:26:11.669022Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-28T17:26:11.669813Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-28T17:26:12.072988Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-28T17:26:11.669764Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-28T17:26:12.072096Z"},"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Lo and behold! If anything, they are *negatively* correlated. This means that generally the trend is to be less interested in automation as you gain experience. In terms of our insights ‚Äî they remain valid: Automation is great, but if there are so many ML enthusiasts who do not use it, shouldn‚Äôt we report results that are realistic for them as well?\n\nThere are many other things we can talk about. Such as the higher variety of algorithms reseachers tend to use or how taking a university ML course impacts the algorithms you choose. But to keep the story short and effective, I decided to only present to the reader what I considered to be the most important insights. \n\nSo let‚Äôs do a quick recap: the Kaggle community enjoys simplicity in all its beauty. But both appliers and researchers have something to win by considering each other a bit more. I believe appliers should actively search to integrate novel techniques in their work. This will push research to be better, which will once again help appliers and so on. That also means researchers should ensure their studies and results are more in line with appliers' needs. I believe Kaggle can help researchers and appliers work together and I suggested two ways of doing this. Lastly, the subject we looked at today is far greater than I could cover. By making the community aware of the problems we identified today and integrating more subpopulation-aware questions in the upcoming surveys, I believe great further insights can be gained in the future. \n\nBefore wrapping up, I want to point out one more thing. Omitting it would be hypocritical. Remember when I said ‚ÄúWhat if some of the Engineers and Data Scientists actually do research as part of their job?‚Äù? I only got to this question because the data wasn‚Äôt making sense. According to my narrow perspective on the world, ML Engineers... ‚Äúengineer‚Äù which cannot include research. Or at least research that pushes the ML field further. Sure, they could be applying it to research questions in science but they don't do actual ML research.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# get the machine learning engineers that are doing ML research\ndf[(df['Q5']=='Machine Learning Engineer') & (df['Q24_Part_6']=='Do research that advances the state of the art of machine learning')]","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-11-28T17:41:58.670487Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-11-28T17:41:58.670952Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-11-28T17:41:58.914686Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-11-28T17:41:58.670918Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-11-28T17:41:58.913826Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I was surprised to find out what a wrong perception I‚Äôd had until looking at this data.

I myself am still a beginner in the field of Data Science and Machine Learning and I know that there is a long way to go. I had a lot of fun exploring different ways to tackle problems this datset had to offer. I did my best to bring out as many insights from the data that I could. Please feel free to ask  me personally if you have any questions and I would be glad to answer them. Looking forward to many more competitions like this in the future.\\\n\n- <b>I hope that Kagglers who read this notebook enjoyed it and found something useful out of it. If you do like the work that I did, I'd appreciate it if you let me know in the comments. I wish you all the best in your Data Science journey. Thanks for reading once again and Good Luck :)</b>","metadata":{}}]}

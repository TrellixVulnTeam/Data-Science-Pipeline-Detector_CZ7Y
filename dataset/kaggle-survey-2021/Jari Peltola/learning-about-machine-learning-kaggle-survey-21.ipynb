Introduction <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter_1\"></a>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 1.1 The possibilities of ML <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter_1_1\"></a>\n\nThis notebook and particularly its research question first came to being thanks to my Japanese language studies as I was watching the Japanese drama series *Japan Sinks: People of Hope* (*Nippon Chinbotsu: Kibo no Hito*) the other night (*link:* __[series Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Sinks:_People_of_Hope)__). The series - as its revealing title suggests - is the latest reboot of the 1973 disaster novel by **Sakyo Komatsu** with the same title (*link:* __[novel Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japan_Sinks)__).\n\nAs a published novelist myself,  my original motive for learning more about data analysis was strictly personal: I was in the middle of writing a new book and needed information no one else seemed to be in possession of. Thanks to for example the well-constructed Kaggle crash courses, I now know a little something also about machine learning (ML) methods. \n\nHowever I noticed that even in the updated *Japan Sinks* drama series rendition, in the story analyzing and modeling geological data is something almost magical, something only a handful of dedicated specialists can do. Most people in the series still rely on either Japanese government or journalists and news agencies to passively receive fateful information about the future of their sinking homeland (*not a spoiler thanks to series title*).\n\nContrary to this, as Kaggle has effectively proven with its own existence over the past few years, ***skills concerning different aspects of data analysis can actually have an empowering effect***. Instead of relying on others for facts and hypotheses, people can now do it all themselves. When put in professional use, these methods may potentially lead to for example life-saving machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) applications for better breast cancer screening (*link:* __[Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferhicks/2021/10/06/heres-how-artificial-intelligence-can-help-predict-breast-cancer-risk/?sh=351a9dbd4bec)__).\n\nThus in my mind there's no doubt that machine learning can be applied in numerous ways that significantly benefit peoples' lives. To me the value of Kaggle lies in the fact that ***increasing data analysis and machine learning knowledge also increases the ability for critical thinking i.e. recognizing misinformation, deliberately biased interpretations and falsely applied methods***. As the recent COVID-19 vaccination discourse has effectively proved to be true, even these skills may end up being of life-saving nature. \n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 1.2 The limits of ML <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter_1_2\"></a>\n\nOne of the most talked about recent topics concerning data science has been about setting international regulations for using AI and ML as well as safeguards on applications considered as \"risky\" (*link:* __[AP News article](https://apnews.com/article/artificial-intelligence-technology-business-europe-ursula-von-der-leyen-19ec99f8a970fe14a99a84d52017ec22)__). Also, there is the existing debate on the \"inbound\" limits of AI and computers in general. As **Robert J. Marks** argued to **Larry Linenschmidt** in his podcast episode (*link:* __[podcast article](https://mindmatters.ai/2020/08/six-limitations-of-artificial-intelligence-as-we-know-it/)__), these limitations are as following:\n<br><br>\n- ***Computers (and AI) are limited to algorithms.***<br>\n- ***Computers are faster than before but not more intelligent.***<br>\n- ***Computers only make use of data which they’ve been presented.***<br>\n- ***Computers don’t experience things or make judgements.***<br> \n- ***Computers do exactly what they were programmed to do.***<br>\n\nIf one thinks about for example the case of *Japan Sinks*, more than often in the series plot AI and ML possess almost supernatural powers similar to what electricity was once considered to have, or what nuclear technology made people imagine in 1950s classic sci-fi stories (*some half of all Marvel's superheroes seem to have been created by different nuclear accidents*). \n\n***This mental image of AI and ML as a “go-to-solution” to every possible problem is largely fictional. Yet this line of thinking has a profound effect on what people expect AI and ML to do for them in reality.*** As another example, just think about the mental image of flying cars. Although no such inventions have so far existed in reality, many people are genuinely disappointed that this feature of flying is not included in their current commuter vehicles as a default setting.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 1.3 The ethical dimension of ML <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter_1_3\"></a>\n\nThere is also the ethical aspect of applying AI and ML. Because flying cars are not available, let's imagine a logistical ML application designed for transferring groups of people from place A to place B. For example in commuting or post-pandemic travel industry, well-functioning global logistics undoubtedly result in better customer satisfaction as well as in various cost savings (fuel and energy consumption etc.).\n\n*But what happened if the very same application would be given the task on how to efficiently transfer people to concentration camp facilities?*\n\nProbably the application would calculate most direct routes, efficient hubs and correct connections without any problem, since the data would not include the actual experience or moral context of the task. There would be no need for the computer to defend its actions, since the computer would only do exactly what it was programmed to do. However, only in slightly different words, the very same argument were presented - not by a computer but by a human defendant - in the Nuremberg trial (*link:* __[Nuremberg trial article](https://famous-trials.com/Nuremberg)__):\n\n**\"*I was given this assignment which I could not refuse.*\"** \n**(Fritz Sauckel, Chief of Slave Labor Recruitment)**\n\nMoreover, presented only with logistical data, an AI judge application would probably have concluded that the very defendant was not guilty, since the AI app would not have found any procedural errors. Based on this, we can conclude that there can be both positive and negative aspects regarding the use of AI and ML. ***The decision of how and when ML applications are used still falls in the hands of the people***, no matter how evolved a system we are talking about. After all, ***the computer cannot refuse the task it is given***.\n\nThe appropriate role of humans in all this is not to imitate AI and ML strengths but, rather, compensate their weaknesses. In the end computing power is all about calculations, but that’s not how human brain or human life in general works. This was effectively proven for example by the protagonist **Arthur Dent** in **Douglas Adams's** novel *The Hitchhiker’s Guide To Galaxy*, when Arthur crashed the most powerful computer in the universe by giving it the menial task of making a decent cup of tea. Our thinking, laced sometimes with mere suspicions and vague speculations, does not comply with the rigid terms of machine learning, and neither should this be the case. In the end, ***it is the people who came up with machine learning, not the other way***.\n\n**But what was the specific research question that came to my mind while watching** \n***Japan Sinks ?*** ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 1.4 Research question <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter_1_4\"></a>\n\nIn last year's Kaggle Survey competition I basically analyzed where Kaggle users are *not* from, what age are they *not* etc. This year - already preoccupied with the above themes concerning machine learning - I decided to go for a slightly different approach. \n\n***My main point of interest in this notebook is the 15th question (Q15) in the survey (\"For how many years have you used machine learning methods?\")***. I was intrigued by the fact that *there were no additional questions regarding specific purposes of people using ML*. Secondly, ***the first answer option (\"I do not use machine learning methods\") seemed to me like a potential \"digital divide\", defined here as lack of adequate physical, economical, educational etc. resources to information technology.*** \n\nIf the use of various AI and ML applications is to rapidly increase in the near future as it seems, those on the other side of that divide will inevitably \"sink\" or be defined as \"0\" for example by any job recruit ML application compared to those getting \"1\" in the same appraisal. Also, the programmed machine learning application would - being completely unaware of it - be guilty of applicant favoritism based on its own existence. (\"*My name is ML. Do you know me or how I work? No? Ok, next applicant, please.*\")\n\nBased on all this, ***my research question is to find out if there are common factors between Kaggle members not familiar with machine learning methods***. Conversely, ***I will also search for potential similarities in Kaggle users with at least some ML methods experience*** by their own admission. To attain this, I will deliberately create the aforementioned digital divide and classify Kaggle members as \"0\" and \"1\" when it comes to ML knowledge.\n\nThat's already a full plate so let's start enjoying, or *itadakimasu*, as they say in Japan before delicious meal.\n<br>\n<br>\n***November 5th, 2021***<br>\n***Jari Peltola***\n\n<br><br>\n******","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 2.

Therefore it is practical to create a new column with value \"0\" if the person does not possess ML experience and \"1\" if he or she is familiar with the subject matter. \n\nThere are several ways (lambda function etc.) for doing this, but in this case I will make use of the original unique answer choices we just printed. As the string \"year\" is included only in answers with ML experience, those answers will be mapped as \"1\" based on the string. \n\nFurthermore, I would still like to keep the answers with null values (nan) in ML experience column because of the data included in other columns. Here I will also make the general assumption that no one answering the Kaggle survey wanted to keep their true ML experience as a secret, and map those null values as \"0\" as well.\n\n***In some special cases hiding one's ML abilities may actually be necessary***. After the latest Taliban takeover, in Afghanistan hundreds of girls and women continue to learn coding online and in hidden makeshift classrooms (*link:* __[Al Jazeera article about Afghanistan](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/10/29/afghanistan-girls-coding-underground-taliban-education?sf153637013=1)__). As one Afghan woman described her situation in the article: “*when online, you can be locked at home and explore the virtual world without any hesitation, without worrying about geographical boundaries. That’s the beauty of technology.*” \n\nTaking a look at the other columns while keeping in mind the research question, ***the member age, gender and location columns would seem to provide us most potentially interesting information***. As for other columns, for example ***social media use may not be a question of personal choice, since the access to some social media platforms is restricted in certain parts of the world*** (*link:* __[Al Jazeera article about Belarus](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/10/29/belarus-classifies-social-media-channels-as-extremist?sf153665818=1)__).\n\nAlso, ***income as a universal criterion would not work since the value of money is different depending on location***. For example, the GDP per capita in Ethiopia is 2772 USD (*link:* __[Ethiopia Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethiopia)__), whereas the same figure in Norway (*link:* __[Norway Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norway)__) is 64856 USD, rendering the two figures basically incomparable with each other. \n\nAs for occupation, without any analysis a strong hypothesis can be made for example about the positive correlation of data scientists and machine learning knowledge. Thus studying this feature feels like writing a young adult novel *The Adventures of Captain Obvious*, so it's better to move on.\n\nThe different questions regarding software applications would indeed give us a more clear conception on ML knowledgeable members since the applications in question are used in machine learning. However, as our research question concerns the divide between \"ML members\" and \"non-ML members\", those survey answers are in our case less relevant. \n\nThe survey dataset does include an abundance of different kinds of data, so for clarity's sake I will next create a new dataframe **df_ml** with **IsML** as its first column.

Unfortunately there was no data in the survey for example about the exact time people have been affiliated with Kaggle, so there is no meaningful way of learning more details on this.\n\nConsidering the nature of Kaggle as data-oriented community, the widespread ML knowledge level is probably not a big surprise though. In similar manner there are hordes of sports enthusiasts on their own fan sites, metalheads on heavy rock online forums etc. \n\nRegarding the research question, this fact does make the dataset inevitably biased, since there is significantly more data on ML experienced people.

Conclusion <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter_8\"></a>","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 8.1 The present of ML <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter_8_1\"></a>\n\nThe question of who (which location or country) holds the \"ML throne\" on Kaggle can be answered in different ways, and the answer is dependent on the method used, as we saw before. Region-wise, as as working hypothesis, for example the relatively high ML knowledge in Australia compared to New Zealand or any nearby regions may be affected by the large community of Chinese etc. students living in Australia. After all, in the Kaggle survey the place of residence was under inquiry instead of nationality, so no further analysis on the subject matter was in this case possible.\n\nIt is also good to remember that in many cases the location-specific data in the Kaggle survey was based on a relatively small number of members even with the threshold of 50 individual members per individual location. Also, everyone included in the survey did not necessarily answer the question about ML knowledge.\n\nConcluding the analysis, we can argue the following based on our data:\n\n- ***There is no significant correlation between ML knowledge and the age, gender or place of reside of a particular Kaggle member***.\n- ***A Kaggle member has a 76.5 percent average probability of being ML knowledgeable regardless of the aforementioned personal details.***\n\nThus on global scale - remembering our research question about \"ML divide\" - one could actually argue that this divide is widest when Kaggle members and \"non-Kaggle people\" are compared. ","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### 8.2 The future of ML <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"chapter_8_2\"></a>\n\nThis of course raises the following question concerning the future:\n\n- ***If more people should become aware of Kaggle (and other similar ML online communities) and join in, would this by itself have more effect on overall population ML knowledge than the individual features included in the current member survey data? In other words, is Kaggle membership actually the very threshold we were just looking for when \"ML divide\" is concerned?***\n\nA good starting point would be to further study the significance of Kaggle membership and ML knowledge more closely. For example, as suggested earlier:\n\n- ***Future surveys could include more detailed questions for example about how long an individual member has been affiliated with Kaggle. That data could then be compared with answers concerning specific ML method knowledge and the timeline of possessing that knowledge.***\n\nShould the analysis prove that these two features indeed correlate with each other, an argument could be made that a significant portion of Kaggle members have gained their ML skills thanks to joining the Kaggle community in the first place. Or one might ask people directly something like \"*What Kaggle courses have you taken or plan to take?* \". \n\nRegarding future courses, a more exploratory question could inquire Kagglers for example if there are any new course topics they would be interested in. This whole wider theme of *why* people chose to join Kaggle in the first place is to me perhaps the most intriguing aspect that has not been a specific topic of inquiry in Kaggle surveys so far.\n\nAs we started this data journey from Japan, it seems that the people there didn't just actually wait for the whole place to sink. Again this was not major news since it is hard to find a nation with more creative people full of unique ideas than Japan. Recently a local start-up company developed a hoverbike which uses machine learning in stabilizing the vehicle (*link:* \n__[BBC article](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-59065674)__). Cars may still not fly, but now there is something to fly over them. As the analyst interviewed by the BBC said regarding the project, \"*things that once seemed like science fiction are becoming more tangible every year* \".\n\n\n\n*Arigato gozaimashita* and thank you for your time.\n\n<br><br>\n***Jari Peltola***<br>\n***Finland***<br>\n\n<br><br>\n******\n","metadata":{}}]}

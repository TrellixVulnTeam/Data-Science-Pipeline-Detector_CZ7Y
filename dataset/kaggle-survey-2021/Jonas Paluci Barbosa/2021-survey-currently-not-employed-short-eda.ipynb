It is also composed of people in different stages in their professional lives. \n\nThe Annual Machine Learning and Data Science Survey, conducted every year since 2017, allows us to obtain a comprehensive view of our community and its subsets. Some commonly covered topics include the analysis of Kagglers by country, gender, age and preferred programming language. The question \"Select the title most similar to your current role\" also encourages the creation of notebooks focused on the most popular professions and on the student community. However, there is one group that doesn't normally receive a similar attention: The Kagglers who selected the option \"Currently Not Employed\".\n\nIn this notebook, I explore this subset of the Kaggle community, analyzing their distribution among different demographic features (gender, age and education) and the unemployment rate for each chosen category.\n\n## Notes About the Dataset\n\nRemoved Samples: In an attempt to focus on people that are most likely looking for a job, I removed the samples that have the option ‘Student’ as their current role. I also made the decision to remove the respondents that are less than 22 years old or above 60 years old.\n\nQuestion #2 (Gender): The options “Nonbinary”, “Prefer not to say” and “Prefer to self-describe” have a low number of respondents. To analyze the unemployment rate by group, I created a new column called “Gender”, where those answers were set as “Other option”.\n\nQuestion #3 (Country):\nSome countries account for a small number of respondents. To analyze the unemployment by country, I made the decision to create a new column called “Country”, where all answers that correspond to nations with less than 200 respondents on the remaining dataset were changed to the option “Other”.\n\nQuestion #4 (Education Level):\n-\tThe options “Doctoral degree” and “Professional doctorate” were changed to “Doctor’s degree”;\n-\tThe options “No formal education past high school” and “Some college/university study without earning a bachelor’s degree” were changed to “No degree”.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Importing

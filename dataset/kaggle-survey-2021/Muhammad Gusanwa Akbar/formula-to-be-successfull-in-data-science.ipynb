We might agree that data science is big thing and has big role right now and in the future. In short, data science is good career. Just looking at the prize of the competitions on kaggle, might be prove for this statement.\n\nGetting money in data's field is also hard, i will prove you in this analysis. You can even declare yourself successfull enough,with just getting money from this field. Because in this data, most people even could'nt get money from their own field, you will be unique and success enough if you can earn some money from this field. this analysis is good and helpfull for all of you who's trying to finding a career path.\n\nSo the contradiction is exist now, how can good career has bad salary?

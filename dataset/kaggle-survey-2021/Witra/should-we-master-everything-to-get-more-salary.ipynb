As a beginner, I am feeling stumbling with so many languages, platforms, tools, etc out there. I don‚Äôt know where to start. How many languages I should learn? Do I have to master all programming languages, frameworks, tools, and hardware? how the ideal number of languages, tools, hardware should be mastered? How long should I spend time? The most important thing is with the current knowledge and skills, how much can I charge for my service? Or what is the minimum skillset needed to be able get employed with minimum salary? What is the ideal path to increase my rate? And so on. </div> \n<br>\nDo you also feel the same?

Besides its development status, another consideration to choose those selected above is the number of respondents. I prioritize the country which has greater number of respondents.

Then we go to the maximum property, we can clearly see in some first parameter such as activities, programming language, etc, the salary category 4 respondents are beaten by the salary category 1. It supports that we, as beginner, sometimes just stumble to decide what matter for ous. On the other hand, people who are more experience (in this case, we assume a general case that higher salary means strong experience) are able decide better what should they have to master further.\n<br><br>\nFurthermore, we can see in the figure of statistical property 6 (min) that even not all parameters we need to master. Perhaps we can focus on basic, or machine learning. But, don't get wrong that all questions (parameters) in this survey need to be mastered. However there is one parameter that we don't have to ignore. That is key activities.

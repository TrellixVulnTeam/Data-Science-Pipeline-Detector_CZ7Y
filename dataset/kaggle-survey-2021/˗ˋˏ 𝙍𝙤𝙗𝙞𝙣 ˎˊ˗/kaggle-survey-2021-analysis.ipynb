A ‚Äústory‚Äù could be defined any number of ways, and that‚Äôs deliberate. The challenge is to deeply explore (through data) the impact, priorities, or concerns of a specific group of data science and machine learning practitioners. That group can be defined in the macro (for example: anyone who does most of their coding in Python) or the micro (for example: female data science students studying machine learning in masters programs). \n    \n*This is an opportunity to be creative and tell the story of a community you identify with or are passionate about!*\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<blockquote> <span style=\"font-family:Georgia;color:#CF673A;font-weight:bold;background:#E8DCCC\">Introduction:</span>\n\nHey!

I look up to many people here and learned a lot in the past few months and want to get involved in the most creative competition of Kaggle's 5th Survey.\n\nI will try to do my best here with creativity and analysis. I am working on ideas on how I am going to tell the story, but I started with my favorite season of the year autumn so my colors are inspired by it. I will keep updating the notebook with new Ideas and hopefully will complete it before submission.\n\nLet's get started and

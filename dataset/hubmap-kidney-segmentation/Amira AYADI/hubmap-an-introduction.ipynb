In humans, the proper functioning of organs and tissues is dependent on the interaction, spatial organization, and specialization of all our cells.  Scientists estimate there are 37 trillion cells in an adult human body, so determining the function and relationship among these cells is a monumental undertaking.  Using the latest molecular and cellular biology technologies, HuBMAP researchers are studying the connections that cells have with each other throughout the body. The resulting HuBMAP Atlas will be openly available to accelerate understanding of the relationships between cell and tissue organization and function and human health.\n\n\nThis competition, â€œHacking the Kidney,\" starts by mapping the human kidney at single cell resolution. The goal is to detect glomeruli functional tissue units (FTUs) across different tissue preparation pipelines. "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Table of Contents\n1.

Once in the kidney, the blood passes through the nephrons, where waste products and extra water are removed. The clean blood is returned to the body through the renal veins.\n\nThe waste products filtered from the blood are then concentrated into urine. The urine is collected in the renal pelvis. The ureters move the urine to the bladder, where it is stored. Urine is passed out of the bladder and the body through the urethra."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![kidney](https://www.cancer.ca/~/media/CCE/1730/49c7ddb4361bde04bfaca0e8a1d09ca9.png)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Gerotaâ€™s fascia** is a thin, fibrous tissue on the outside of the kidney.

A tissue sample is first preserved by fixing it in formaldehyde, also known as formalin, to preserve the proteins and vital structures within the tissue.

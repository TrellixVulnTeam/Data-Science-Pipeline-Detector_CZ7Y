In our case 1024x1024 blocks (which are later resized to 256x256).\n - Technically, make_grid just specifies the blocks via a series of pixel coordinates ((x1,y1),(x2,y2)).\n - Later, we use the output to loop through each set of coordinates, extract the image, resize, predict, and store results."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Imports"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# For reading tiff images in parts \nimport rasterio\nfrom rasterio.windows import Window\nimport pathlib\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport os","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Full 'Make_Grid' Function"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# https://www.kaggle.com/leighplt/pytorch-fcn-resnet50\ndef make_grid(shape, window=256, min_overlap=32):\n    \"\"\"\n        Return Array of size (N,4), where N = number of tiles,\n        2nd axis represente slices: x1,x2,y1,y2 \n    \"\"\"\n    x, y = shape\n    nx = x // (window - min_overlap) + 1\n    x1 = np.linspace(0, x, num=nx, endpoint=False, dtype=np.int64)\n    x1[-1] = x - window\n    x2 = (x1 + window).clip(0, x)\n    ny = y // (window - min_overlap) + 1\n    y1 = np.linspace(0, y, num=ny, endpoint=False, dtype=np.int64)\n    y1[-1] = y - window\n    y2 = (y1 + window).clip(0, y)\n    slices = np.zeros((nx,ny, 4), dtype=np.int64)\n    \n    for i in range(nx):\n        for j in range(ny):\n            slices[i,j] = x1[i], x2[i], y1[j], y2[j]    \n    return slices.reshape(nx*ny,4)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Settings & Global Variables"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"DATA_ORIG_PATH = '../input/hubmap-kidney-segmentation'\nidentity = rasterio.Affine(1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0)\n# WINDOW is the size of the tile to be read by rasterio\nWINDOW = 1024\n# Tiles will have some overlap\nMIN_OVERLAP = 32\n# Tiles will be resized to NEW_SIZE, which is the size of the image\n# on which, we have trained our model.\nNEW_SIZE = 256","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html\n\n\"This module offers classes representing filesystem paths with semantics appropriate for different operating systems.

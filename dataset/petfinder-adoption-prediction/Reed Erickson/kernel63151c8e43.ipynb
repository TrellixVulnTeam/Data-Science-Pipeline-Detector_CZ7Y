The value is determined by how quickly, if at all, a pet is adopted. The values are determined in the following way: \n- 0 - Pet was adopted on the same day as it was listed. \n- 1 - Pet was adopted between 1 and 7 days (1st week) after being listed. \n- 2 - Pet was adopted between 8 and 30 days (1st month) after being listed. \n- 3 - Pet was adopted between 31 and 90 days (2nd & 3rd month) after being listed. \n- 4 - No adoption after 100 days of being listed. (There are no pets in this dataset that waited between 90 and 100 days).\n\n### File descriptions\n- train.csv - Tabular/text data for the training set\n- train.csv - Tabular/text data for the training set\n- test.csv - Tabular/text data for the test set\n- sample_submission.csv - A sample submission file in the correct format\n- breed_labels.csv - Contains Type, and BreedName for each BreedID.

For example, a pet's age is used since we know that a pet that's 9 months old is similar to a pet that's 10 months old since 9 and 10 are relatively close to each other numerically. Likewise, a 60 month old pet is different from a 9 month year old pet since 60 and 9 are far apart numerically.\n\nSome features may need to be modified. For example, Vaccinated has values of  (1 = Yes, 2 = No, 3 = Not Sure) but this will confuse a neural network because these numbers are not relative to each other. So, it might be better to encode Yes as + 1 and No as -1 and then have Not Sure as 0 since that would be relatively in the middle between -1 and +1.\n\nThe code for doing this is beyond the scope of this course, so you may want to simply avoid features where the numerical values are not relative. If you are interested in coding, the following code defines a function to do so, and then the map method applies this function to each pet's Vaccinated feature.\n\nAgain, everything we do to the training data, we also need to do to the submission data.\n\n"},{"metadata":{"id":"9OEJd-Fr9eSm","colab_type":"code","outputId":"0aa5729a-930c-46b1-a6fd-4153566293d6","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":375},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Vaccinated - Pet has been vaccinated (1 = Yes, 2 = No, 3 = Not Sure)\n#encodedVaccinated = train[['Vaccinated']] \ndef fixVac( value ):\n    if value == 1: return +1\n    elif value == 2: return -1\n    else: return 0\n\n#train['encodedVaccinated'] = list(map(lambda a: 0 if (a>1) else a,train['Vaccinated']))\npet_train['encodedVaccinated'] = list(map(fixVac,train['Vaccinated']))\n# Do the same thing to the submission data\npet_submit['encodedVaccinated'] = list(map(fixVac,submit['Vaccinated']))\n\npet_train.head(10)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"O-7_xF5L42yG","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""},{"metadata":{"id":"yAHNOrk49eSr","colab_type":"code","outputId":"6459f12d-a602-4bf8-9920-7ed91205b0b3","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":69},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print (\"pet_train data shape: \" ,pet_train.shape)\nprint (\"pet_adopt_speed data shape: \" ,pet_adopt_speed.shape)\nprint (\"pet_submit data shape: \" ,pet_submit.shape)\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"id":"a_XBCy6SSq_l","colab_type":"text"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n### Scale and Split the data\n\n**Scale Data:** Neural Networks work best with the inputs are between 0 and +1, but the grayscale images have pixel values between 0 and 255.

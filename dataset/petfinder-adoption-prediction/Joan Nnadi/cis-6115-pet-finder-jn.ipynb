Even though they may be enoced as a number, the numbers do not relate numerically to each other. So if one dog has color 2 and  dog two has color 4, this does not mean dog two is twice as colorful as dog one. It only means that they have different colors. One might be light brown and the other gray.\n\n\nFor neural networks it works better when encode categorical data as one-hot encoding.

For example, a pet's age is used since we know that a pet that's 9 months old is similar to a pet that's 10 months old since 9 and 10 are relatively close to each other numerically. Likewise, a 60 month old pet is different from a 9 month year old pet since 60 and 9 are far apart numerically.\n\nSome features may need to be modified. For example, Vaccinated has values of  (1 = Yes, 2 = No, 3 = Not Sure) but this will confuse a neural network because these numbers are not relative to each other. So, it might be better to encode Yes as + 1 and No as -1 and then have Not Sure as 0 since that would be relatively in the middle between -1 and +1.\n\nThe code for doing this is beyond the scope of this course, so you may want to simply avoid features where the numerical values are not relative. If you are interested in coding, the following code defines a function to do so, and then the map method applies this function to each pet's Vaccinated feature.\n\nAgain, everything we do to the training data, we also need to do to the submission data.\n\n","metadata":{"id":"Lkkbh-5uQIwy"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Vaccinated -

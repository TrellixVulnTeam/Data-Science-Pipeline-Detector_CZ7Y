Introduction\nIn earlier notebook(https://www.kaggle.com/anirbansen3027/jtcc-bag-of-words) we used CountVectorizer (an sklearn implementation of Bag-of-Words) model to convert the texts to a numerical dataset, mapped against the output variables \"toxic\",\"severe_toxic\",\"obscene\",\"threat\",\"insult\",\"identity_hate\" and used Multi Output Classifier wrapper from sklearn to create Logistic Regression models for all the 6 output variables.\n\nIn this one, we will be replacing the first part with a Word2Vec model to create an embedding instead of the BagOfWords vector and then input that to a Logistic Regression Model (Any ML/DL model can be built on top of the Word2Vec embedding).\n\n### Brief Intuition:\n#### What is Word Embedding?\nWord embeddings give us a way to use an efficient, dense representation in which similar words have a similar encoding. Importantly, you do not have to specify this encoding by hand. An embedding is a dense vector of floating point values (the length of the vector is a parameter you specify).\n<img src=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ali_Basirat/publication/327074728/figure/fig1/AS:678946643386368@1538884902625/A-two-dimensional-representation-of-word-embeddings-Words-with-similar-meanings-are.png\" width=\"500\">\n\nAbove is a 2-dimensional word embedding where Sunday has more similar values to other weekdays than members of a family\n\n#### What is Word2Vec?\nWord2Vec is one of the oldest methods to create/learn this embeddings. Word2Vec is not a singular algorithm, rather, it is a family of model architectures and optimizations that can be used to learn word embeddings from large datasets. Embeddings learned through Word2Vec have proven to be successful on a variety of downstream natural language processing tasks like Text Classification, Question Answering. The papers proposed two methods for learning representations of words:\n\n**Continuous Bag-of-Words Model** which predicts the middle word based on surrounding context words. The context consists of a few words before and after the current (middle) word. This architecture is called a bag-of-words model as the order of words in the context is not important.\n\n**Continuous Skip-gram Model** which predict words within a certain range before and after the current word in the same sentence.\n\nArchitecture Diagrams:\n<img src=\"https://3qeqpr26caki16dnhd19sv6by6v-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Word2Vec-Training-Models.png\" width=\"500\">\n\nExamples:\n![](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Vz5pLuZ49K8/XV0ErlMtdDI/AAAAAAAAB0A/FIM74z__LAUkCqpW12ViAnGX8Br56W2PQCEwYBhgL/s1600/image001.png)\nIn CBOW, given the words (the quick brown box, over the lazy log), we would want to predict jump.\nIn Skipgram just the opposite given the word jump, we would want to predict (the quick brown box, over the lazy log)\n\n#### But how does the models learn?\nI tried to make an image as that would be easier to grasp. It might look scary at first but I will try my best to explain.\nLets's start with CBOW, we take the sentence \"Natural Language Processing\" where \"Natural\" and \"Processing\" are context words and \"Language\" is the target word. We have a shallow network as shown above with a single hidden layer. \n\nSo the input is a one-hot encoded vector of V terms, V being the size of vocabulary (total number of unique words) with only single 1. So let's say we have only 5 words in vocabulary (Natural, Language, Processing, is, great). The vector for Natural will be [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Similarly for Processing it will be [0, 0, 1, 0, 0].\nNow, we have a randomly initialised Embedding vector(E) with size V * D where D is the dimension size of the vector which you can choose on. This is the weight matrix for the input layer.\nSo, we multiply the input one-hot encoded vector with the weights/embedding vector. This gives the embedding vectors for the context words of size 1 * D.\n\nNow in the hidden layer, we average the emedding vectors for the context words which forms the input for this layer of size 1* D. This is multiplied by another Vector called Context Vector (E') with size D * V. This gives us a vector of 1 * V which is then passed through a sigmoid function to get the final output.\n\nThe final output is compared with the one-hot encoded vector of Language (the middle word) [0, 1, 0, 0, 0] and loss function is calculated. This loss is back propogated and the model is trained using Gradient Descent\n\nThe final o\n<img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/JsCPzSX.png\" title=\"source: imgur.com\" width=\"1000\"/>\n\n#### How will be get the embeddings?\nGensim library enables us to develop word embeddings.Gensim gives you an option to choose the either CBOW or Skipgram while training your own embeddings.(Default is CBOW). Along with it, Gensim also has a directory of pretrained embeddings which are trained on several documents like wiki pages, google news, twitter tweets etc. In this example, we will be using a pretrained embedding based on Google News corpus (3 billion running words) word vector model (3 million 300-dimension English word vectors). \n\nOk enough of definitions.

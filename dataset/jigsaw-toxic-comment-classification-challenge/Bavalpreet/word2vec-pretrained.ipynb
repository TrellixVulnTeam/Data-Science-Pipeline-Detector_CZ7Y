Word2Vec is trained on the Google News dataset (about 100 billion words). It has several use cases such as Recommendation Engines, Knowledge Discovery, and also applied in the different Text Classification problems.\n\nThe architecture of Word2Vec is really simple. It’s a feed-forward neural network with just one hidden layer. Hence, it is sometimes referred to as a Shallow Neural Network architecture.\n\nDepending on the way the embeddings are learned, Word2Vec is classified into two approaches:\n\n1. Continuous Bag-of-Words (CBOW)\n\n2. Skip-gram model","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For example, consider the sentence: “I have topped at times but I never stopped trying”.  Let’s say we want to learn the embedding of the word “topped”. So, here the focus word is “topped”.\n\nThe first step is to define a context window. A context window refers to the number of words appearing on the left and right of a focus word. The words appearing in the context window are known as neighboring words (or context). Let’s fix the context window to 1 and then see input and output for both approaches:\n\nContinuous Bag-of-Words: Input = [ have, at ],  Output = topped\n\nSkip-gram: Input = topped, Output = [ have, at ]\n\nAs you can see here, CBOW accepts multiple words as input and produces a single word as output whereas Skip-gram accepts a single word as input and produces multiple words as output.\n\nSo, let us define the architecture according to the input and output.

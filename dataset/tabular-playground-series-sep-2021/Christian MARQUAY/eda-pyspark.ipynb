This is the opportunity to use PySpark to query data efficiently. PySpark is a language for practicing EDA in particular, which uses Python to perform parallel tasks on the data. The data is loaded into a Spark dataframe which looks like what is known with R and Pandas but which is a distributed table. Spark dataframes thus offer a wider range of transformation than with Pandas dataframes. We'll finally see that Spark dataframes offer the possibility of using SQL for queries.\n\nIf you're browsing this notebook, feel free to comment.

Grouping and aggregating data\n\nWe display a lot of stats, but we may also want to use them. Spark dataframes can be grouped by column values to obtain statistics through aggregations. With min, max, and skewness, we can find the minimum, the maximum, and the skewness of a column. With mean and stddev, we can standardize the data.\n\nHere, we try to compare the statistics obtained just above to see if there is a difference in the distribution of the features when claim is equal to 0 and when claim is equal to 1. We therefore calculate the z-score to know if claim==0 is significantly different from a population where claim==1. A z-score is the distance in standard deviations of a value from the mean. 67% of the data in a distribution have a z-score between -1 and 1. 95% of the data in a distribution have a z-score between -2 and 2. 97.5% of the data in a distribution have a z-score between -3 and 3. This is why we consider z-scores less than -3 or greater than 3 as outliers.\n\nWe find that no z-score exceeds 0.05 and that the two distributions are therefore very similar.

The original dataset deals with predicting whether a claim will be made on an insurance policy. Although the features are anonymized, they have properties relating to real-world features.\n\nThe aim is predict whether a customer made a claim upon an insurance policy. The ground truth claim is binary valued, but a prediction may be any number from 0.0 to 1.0, representing the probability of a claim. The features in this dataset have been anonymized and may contain missing values.\n\nSubmissions are evaluated on area under the ROC curve between the predicted probability and the observed target.\n\nThis competition involves a tabular dataset. Intended as a stepping store between 'Titanic Getting Started' competition and a Featured competition, it should be approachable for all. Competitions masters or grandmasters won't be challenge by this level. \n\n# About this notebook\n\nThis notebook is a work in progress and will be regularly updated. It is my first notebook of this competition and will concentrate on data exploration and creating a baseline for future notebooks that will concentrate on modelling different solutions. This is a beginner level notebook meant for my own use and not indended to be a training aid or tutorial. Some of the code will be taken from other public notebooks, sources will be creditted at the bottom.\n\n# About David Coxon\n\nI work in IT for an art gallery and generally work with inhouse data on visitor numbers, public donations, powerusage, course attendance, sentament analysis and Adwords, much of my work in with time series.\n\nThis is my fourth contest, starting with Titanic I moved on to tackle a house pricing contest and then the 30days of ML challenge.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Set up environment\n\nLets import all of the libraries that we will need to complete the notebook.

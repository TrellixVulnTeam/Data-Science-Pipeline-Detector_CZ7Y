DATA CLEANING**\n\n**2.0 DATASET SPLIT**\n\nBefore proceeding any further, it is recommended to split the dataset into a training set and a hold-out cross-validation set.

This is because we are always looking for a method that could maximize the data that we train our model on. Also, for a small training set, *train_test_split* could lead to inconsistent predictions for the test set.\n- On the other hand, for a large dataset like the one we're given here, using *K fold* would greatly compromise on the computation speed of our model. Also, since we have a large number of training examples, using only *train_test_split* should be enough information for our model to properly learn the parameters.\n\nSo, as a conclusion to the above two points, we will use *train_test_split* for this dataset.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\nX = train_orig.copy()\nY = X.claim\nX.drop('claim', axis = 1, inplace = True)\n\nX_train_orig, X_valid_orig, Y_train_orig, Y_valid_orig = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size = 0.2,\n                                                                         random_state = 42)\nX_test_orig = test_orig.copy()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-12T11:03:48.408709Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-12T11:03:48.409002Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-12T11:03:50.270981Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-12T11:03:48.408973Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-12T11:03:50.269377Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**2.1 MISSING VALUES**\n\nAs we saw earlier, most of the features have missing values.

FEATURE SCALING**\n\n\n\nMany machine learning algorithms perform better when numerical input variables are scaled to a standard range.\n\nStandardizing is a popular scaling technique that subtracts the mean from values and divides by the standard deviation, transforming the probability distribution for an input variable to a standard Gaussian (zero mean and unit variance). Standardization can become skewed or biased if the input variable contains outlier values.\n\nTo overcome this, the median and interquartile range can be used when standardizing numerical input variables, generally referred to as robust scaling.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler, StandardScaler\n\nrobust_scaler = RobustScaler()\nrobust_scaler.fit(X_train_imputed)\nX_train_robust = robust_scaler.transform(X_train_imputed)\nX_valid_robust = robust_scaler.transform(X_valid_imputed)\nX_test_robust = robust_scaler.transform(X_test_imputed)\n\nstandard_scaler = StandardScaler()\nstandard_scaler.fit(X_train_robust)\nX_train_scaled = standard_scaler.transform(X_train_robust)\nX_valid_scaled = standard_scaler.transform(X_valid_robust)\nX_test_scaled = standard_scaler.transform(X_test_robust)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-12T11:03:54.321283Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-12T11:03:54.321718Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-12T11:04:00.4361Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-12T11:03:54.321686Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-12T11:04:00.43532Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"On passing through the Scalers, our Data Frame has now been converted to a numpy array.

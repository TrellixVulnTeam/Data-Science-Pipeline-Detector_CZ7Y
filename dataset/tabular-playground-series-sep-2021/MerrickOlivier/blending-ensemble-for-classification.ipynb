These methods both involve using the predictions made by various base models as features for a meta-model, which provides a final prediction. In this notebook, we create a simple blended model for Kaggle's \"Tabular Playground Series - Sep 2021\" competition. This notebook is meant to serve as an example on how to blend models; as such, we will be utilizing less computationally expensive base models to generate predictions.  \n\nPrior to jumping in, it should be noted that there is a subtle difference between model blending and stacking, which can be summarized as follows:\n\n**Stacked Model**: An ensemble of models in which the meta-model is trained on out-of-fold predictions made by the base models during k-fold cross validation. \n\n**Blended Model**: An ensemble of models in which the meta-model is trained on predictions made by the base models on a holdout dataset (e.g., the validation dataset).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Import Necessary

This involved preprocessing our data, feature engineering, and creating custom functions to train and evaluate base-models, as well as our meta model. The latter model was trained with features which were each comprised of predictions made by base models - to avoid long waits, we used simple Sklearn models as our base models. Overall, one can clearly see how blending models can provide a greater AUC-ROC score than any of the individual base models.\n\nIf one were to use this method for an actual competition, or for business purposes, then it is highly recommended that one try various base models and select those which provide the best results in the context of one's end goal. With the chosen base models, one should attempt to find the optimal hyperparameters for each model - using either hyperopt or optuna is highly recommended. Finally, one should use the optmized base models and try to determine the best hyperparameters for the meta-model.\n\nThank's for reading through this notebook.

The most notable advantages are their ability to collapse all preprocessing and modeling steps into a single estimator, preventing data leakage by never calling `fit` on validation sets and an added bonus that makes the code concise, reproducible, and modular.\n\nBut this whole idea of atomic, neat pipelines breaks when we need to perform operations that are not built into Sklearn as estimators. For example, what if you need to extract regex patterns to clean text data?

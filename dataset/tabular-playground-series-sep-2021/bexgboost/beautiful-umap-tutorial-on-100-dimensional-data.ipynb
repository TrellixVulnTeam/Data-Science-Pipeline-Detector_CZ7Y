You need to get inspiration from masterpiece visuals like at FlowingData or relevant subreddits, but you don't have to go that far. Recently, I have been fortunate to come across UMAP — a Python package to visualize and cluster high-dimensional data in breathtakingly beautiful ways.

I recommend trying values between 2-20 at steps of 5 and evaluate different baseline models to see the change in accuracy.\n\nNext, we have `n_neighbors`. It controls the area of the local neighborhood UMAP looks at for each sample when building the manifold. Smaller values narrow the focus to local structure, taking into account peculiarities and small patterns, potentially losing the big picture.\n\nHigher values to `n_neighbors` give more flexibility and allows UMAP to focus on a broader \"view\" of the data in the corresponding dimension.

The documentation suggests setting `low_memory` to True as a possible fix. Additionally, I recommend reducing the memory usage of the dataset by casting each column to the smallest subtype possible using NumPy. I have discussed dealing with out-of-memory issues at length in a previous article ([link](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-work-with-million-row-datasets-like-a-pro-76fb5c381cdd?source=your_stories_page-------------------------------------)).\n\nAlso, don't forget to transform/scale numerical features as they tend to have different scales by default.

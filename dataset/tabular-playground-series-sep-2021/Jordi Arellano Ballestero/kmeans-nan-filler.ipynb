A distribution, or data set, is symmetric if it looks the same to the left and right of the center point.\n    * If the skewness is between -0.5 and 0.5, the data are fairly symmetrical.\n    * If the skewness is between -1 and -0.5(negatively skewed) or between 0.5 and 1(positively skewed), the data are moderately skewed.\n    * If the skewness is less than -1(negatively skewed) or greater than 1(positively skewed), the data are highly skewed.\n        \n        \n\n* **Kurtosis** is a measure of whether the data are heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution.\n    * Mesokurtic: This distribution has kurtosis statistic similar to that of the normal distribution. It means that the extreme values of the distribution are similar to that of a normal distribution characteristic. This definition is used so that the standard normal distribution has a kurtosis of three.\n    * Leptokurtic (Kurtosis > 3): Distribution is longer, tails are fatter. Peak is higher and sharper than Mesokurtic, which means that data are heavy-tailed or profusion of outliers. Outliers stretch the horizontal axis of the histogram graph, which makes the bulk of the data appear in a narrow (“skinny”) vertical range, thereby giving the “skinniness” of a leptokurtic distribution.\n\n    * Platykurtic: (Kurtosis < 3): Distribution is shorter, tails are thinner than the normal distribution. The peak is lower and broader than Mesokurtic, which means that data are light tailed or lack of outliers.

This is the metric used for the [ASHRAE Energy Prediction competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction) and a common metric for regression problems. It is an extension on [Mean Squared Error (MSE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root-mean-square_deviation) that is mainly used when predictions have large deviations, which is the case with this energy prediction competition. Values range from 0 up to millions and we don't want to punish deviations in prediction as much as with MSE.\n\nWe will explore the metric itself as well as some of the best naive predictions that are possible.\n\nP.S. This kernel is the first in a series of kernels on competition metrics.

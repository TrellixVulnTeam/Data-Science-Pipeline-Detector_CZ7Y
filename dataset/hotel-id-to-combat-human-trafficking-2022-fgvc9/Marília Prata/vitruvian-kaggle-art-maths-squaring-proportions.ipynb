He originated the idea that all buildings should have three attributes: firmitas, utilitas, and venustas (\"strength\", \"utility\", and \"beauty\").

His discussion of perfect proportion in architecture and the human body led to the famous Renaissance drawing of the Vitruvian Man by Leonardo da Vinci.\"\n\n\"In 1486, the book was reprinted in Rome for the first time.

It is the challenge of constructing a square with the same area as a given circle by using only a finite number of steps with compass and straightedge. The difficulty of the problem raised the question of whether specified axioms of Euclidean geometry concerning the existence of lines and circles implied the existence of such a square.\"\n\n\"In 1882, the task was proven to be impossible, as a consequence of the Lindemann–Weierstrass theorem, which proves that pi (π) is a transcendental, rather than an algebraic irrational number; that is, it is not the root of any polynomial with rational coefficients. It had been known for decades that the construction would be impossible if π were transcendental, but π was not proven to be transcendental until 1882. Approximate squaring to any given non-perfect accuracy, in contrast, is possible in a finite number of steps, since there are rational numbers arbitrarily close to π.\"\n\n\"The expression \"squaring the circle\" is sometimes used as a metaphor for trying to do the impossible.\"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#Squaring the Circle with HTML/CSS by Shiv Kumar

It is accompanied by notes based on the work of the famed architect, Vitruvius Pollio. The drawing, which is in pen and ink on paper, depicts a male figure in two superimposed positions with his arms and legs apart and simultaneously inscribed in a circle and square. The drawing and text are sometimes called the Canon of Proportions or, less often, Proportions of Man.\" \n\n\"The proportional relationship of the parts reflects the universal design.  These qualities are thus shared equally by God's creation of the human body and the human being's own production of a good building. In the late 1480s, this theme of the artistic microcosm emerged as one of the great unifying principles of his thought.\" \n\nThis image provides a perfect example of Leonardo's keen interest in proportion. In addition, this picture represents a cornerstone of Leonardo's attempts to relate man to nature.  Vitruvian Man as a cosmografia del minor mondo (cosmography of the microcosm).

drawing, intended to explore the idea of proportion, the piece is part work of art and part mathematical diagram, conveying the Old Master's belief that “everything connects to everything else.”\n\nhttps://www.leonardodavinci.net/the-vitruvian-man.jsp\n\n![](https://miro.medium.com/max/600/1*MQn9bLm0xRalH0Q8uoPKpw.png)medium.com","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#Code by

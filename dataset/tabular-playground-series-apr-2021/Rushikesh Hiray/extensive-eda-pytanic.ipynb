Of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard, more than 1,500 died, making the sinking at the time one of the deadliest of a single ship and the deadliest peacetime sinking of a superliner or cruise ship to date. With much public attention in the aftermath the disaster has since been the material of many artistic works and a founding material of the disaster film genre.\n\nWe are going to disect this dataset to understand this disaster better.............."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![Titanic](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/33/Titanic_sinking_gif.gif)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Importing various libraries needed for the EDA"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd                     \nimport numpy as np\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport missingno","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/tabular-playground-series-apr-2021/train.csv')\ndf.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1 style='background:#1E30E9; border:0; color:white'><center>Explaining the Columns</center></h1> \n\n\n1> **PassengerID** - Unique id assigned to every passenger\n\n\n2> **Survived** - Target variable (0 - if the passenger died , 1 - if the passenger survived)\n\n3> **PClass** - Passenger class (1- Upper Class , 2- Middle Class , 3- Lower Class) - Fun Fact > Class 3 ticket costed around 15 to 40 dollars.\n\n4> **Name** - Passenger Name\n\n5> **Sex** - Gender of the passenger\n\n6> **Age** - Age in years\n\n7> **SibSp** - Number of the passenger's siblings and spouse\n\n8> **Parch** - Number of parents and children for the passenger\n\n9> **Ticket** - The Ticket Number\n\n10> **Fare** - Ticket cost for the passenger (need to confirm my 'Fun Fact')\n\n11> **Cabin** - Passenger's Cabin Number\n\n12> **Embarked** - The port where the Passenger set sail (C, Q and S)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<h1 style='background:#1E30E9; border:0; color:white'><center>EDA</center></h1> "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"missingno.bar(df,figsize= (9,6),color= 'red' )","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Seems like we are missing data in Age , Ticket , Embarked and Cabin columns"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Survivor Distribution"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"val  = df['Survived'].value_counts()\npx.pie(names = val.index, values = val.values ,title = 'Survived v/s Not Survived', hole = 0.2)\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"57.2% People onboard died \n\n\n42.8% Survived"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Comparing Sex and Survival rate to know if or not class had any affect on the passenger's survival"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"grp = df.groupby('Sex').count()['Survived']\npx.bar(x = grp.index,y = grp.values, title = 'Surivial grouped by sex',height=700,width =600,color=grp.values )","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Lot more coming soon , plz upvote"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

But for rest, I think it's best to look at other methods to get another perspective.\n\n### Boruta\n\nBoruta is an all-relevant feature selection algorithm based on random forests, feature importance and random variables. In our context, Boruta is a usefull algorithm because it's capable of evaluating the relationship between more than one feature and the target. Thus, we are not limited to assess importance only with bivariate analysis between a feature and our target. \n\nIt works by first creating a shadow variable for each input feature. This shadow variable is a permuted version of the original one, so that it has the distribution but no correlation with the target. Then, a random forest is fitted using both original and shadow features. The algorithm's key ideia is that important features are those that have an importance metric greater than the importance of the best shadow feature. Such important features are recorded with a \"hit\" and this process of creating shadow features and fitting RFs is repeated a number of times. Repetition is important because the algorithm is random in its nature. \n\nAfter that, we will have a list of how many times each variable was a hit and we can use the binomial distribution to assess the probability of getting an amount of hits merely by chance. The variables with low probabilities are considered important and the ones with high probabilities are discarded. The variables with probability between the low and high thresholds are considered tentative and it's up to the user to discard or utilize them. \n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"rf = RandomForestClassifier(n_jobs=-1, max_depth=5, random_state=42)\nfeat_selector = BorutaPy(\n    rf, \n    verbose=2, \n    random_state=42,\n    n_estimators = 'auto', \n    two_step=False\n).fit(x_train_filled.values, y_train.values)","metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-26T21:56:40.553306Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-26T21:56:40.55388Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-26T21:56:40.574774Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-26T21:56:40.553832Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-26T21:56:40.573845Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As we can see, Boruta considered all features relevant to the problem.

Regarding our hyperparameters, the best combination resulted in a set of 218 trees of max depth equal to 8. Notice that both regularization parameters ended up being close to 0, indicating that they didn't help our algorithm. Bagging and feature fraction also had similiar values of about 0.65, that is, in each tree we use 65% of our training samples and in each node split we consider only 65% of the available features.\n\nBelow we can see two graphs showing how was our progress and which hyperparameters were the most important while tuning the random forest mode.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plot_optimization_history(study)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-31T23:32:30.369317Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-31T23:32:30.369813Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-31T23:32:30.429515Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-31T23:32:30.369776Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-31T23:32:30.42856Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"plot_param_importances(study)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-31T23:32:39.804371Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-31T23:32:39.804801Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-31T23:32:44.176111Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-31T23:32:39.804766Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-31T23:32:44.174841Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Retraining with the best parameters\n\nNow I need to retrain the model with the best configuration and the whole dataset in order to evaluate feature importance and make predictions.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"lgbm_final_clf = LGBMClassifier(\n    boosting_type = 'rf',\n    objective = 'binary',\n    metric = 'auc',\n    random_state = 42,\n    n_jobs = -1,\n    subsample_freq = 1,\n    colsample_bytree = 1,\n    learning_rate = 1,\n    **study.best_params\n)\n\nlgbm_final_clf.fit(\n    x_train_filled.values, \n    y_train,\n    verbose = False\n)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-07-31T23:32:58.671789Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-07-31T23:32:58.672173Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-07-31T23:33:08.453493Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-07-31T23:32:58.672143Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-07-31T23:33:08.452316Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Feature importance\n\nTo assess feature importance I'm going to use a method called permutation importance.

So, to model this we would need to know the passenger class. \n \nThe survival of women with kids is much greater than normal women and this could significantly impact their probability of survival.\n\n## Problems\n\n1) Missing data in almost all the columns\n\n2) Some columns where the mean of the data is not at an appropriate value to fill in.\n\n\n## Possible Solution\n\n1) Some of the columns can be filled with fair information as first-class tickets cost more.\n\n2) Using the other column information try to predict the missing data\n\n3) Look at the possibility of replacing by mean for the columns where it is possible. \n\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Plan of Action\n\n1) Using the predictive theory try to model a RandomForestClassifier to predict the survival of the passenger."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Importing the required libraries"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd #

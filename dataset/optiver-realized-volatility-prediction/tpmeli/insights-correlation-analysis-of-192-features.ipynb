The units of the prediction are in a weighted average price of those 10 minutes.**\n\nAs explained in the introduction notebook, Optiver is, among other things, a **market maker** - that is, they are a mediator that takes information about buying prices and selling prices and provides bids to see who is willing to buy and sell.\n\n**They are interested in predicting volatility accurately** since increased volatility allows more flexibility in trading and allows them to make more appealing offers between sellers and buyers.  Although for consumers, volatility can be more uncertain and risky, for traders, volatility also makes assets more liquid (mobile).  Since it refers to the amount of dispersion (spread) of an asset's returns, a higher volatility makes gains as well as losses higher.  Traders prefer it because it makes more profit possible.\n\nOne notion of **volatility** refers to **the standard deviation of the percent change of the price returns of an asset.**  At the most basic level, you can find it by performing **.pct_change().std()** in a dataframe along with some timestep (daily volatility, weekly (5 trading days), monthly (21 trading days), yearly (252 trading days) etc.).  **The date range is important for the notion of realized vs. implied volatility.**   However, in this project you are advised to use a standardized value and use log returns.\n\nWe are also given **the book data which represents the intentions of buyers and sellers.** The more dense this book is, the more variance there may be in bids and asks in relation to the trade that (possibly) happens.  So this can also be used to measure the volatility as well if we find the difference between the best ask price and the best bid price - known as **the bid-ask spread**.  These prices are weighted depending on the level and size of the orders.\n\nIn common terms, volatility measures the variance of returns of an asset, the the more variance there is, the more uncertainty there is and the riskier the asset is.  In quantitative analysis, in order to make these metrics comparable across assets and across different time measures, they are standardized over time (annualized) and returns are converted into log returns to make assets comparable.

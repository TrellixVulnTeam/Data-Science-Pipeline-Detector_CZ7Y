Most of the code in this kernel comed from other notebooks already shared.\n\nHere are some sources:\n1. https://www.kaggle.com/alexioslyon/lgbm-baseline\n2. https://www.kaggle.com/c/optiver-realized-volatility-prediction/discussion/267096\n3. https://www.kaggle.com/denisvodchyts/lgbm-slightly-different-features\n\nIdeas:\n\n1. All the feature scripts are named `{feature_name}.py`. All features can be loaded by calling Loader method. like this:\n\n```python\nimport feature_stat_2\ntrain_df, test_df = feature_stat_2.Loader()\n```\n\n2. All the models are name {model_name}.py. Each model can be trained separately by calling `python nn_feature_stat.py -t -j2`, which will save all the trained model in `./models`, preproprocessing scalers in `./scalers` and OOF predictions in `./oof`. Inferencing by `python nn_feature_stat.py -j2`, which will produce `./predictions/nn_feature_stat_2_1.npy` as prediction output.\n\nBelow is an example for prediction using nn model with feature_stat_2_1 as input.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!ln -sf ../input/optiverdataset/optiver-features/features ./features\n!ln -sf ../input/optiverdataset/optiver-models/models ./models\n!ln -sf ../input/optiverdataset/optiver-scalers/scalers ./scalers\n!cp ../input/optiverdataset/optiver-src/*.py ./\n!mkdir -p predictions","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-14T21:56:47.36002Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-14T21:56:47.360567Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-14T21:56:51.122558Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-14T21:56:47.360462Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-14T21:56:51.120905Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!python nn_feature_stat.py -j2 -n2\n!python lgbm_feature_stat.py -j2\n\nfrom utils import *\n\ntest_df = pd.read_csv('../input/optiver-realized-volatility-prediction/test.csv')\ntest_df['target'] = np.load('./predictions/nn_feature_stat_2_2.npy') * .6 + np.load('./predictions/lgbm_feature_stat_2.npy') * .4\ntest_df[['row_id', 'target']].to_csv('submission.csv', index=False)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-14T21:56:51.125423Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-14T21:56:51.12596Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-14T22:00:23.449113Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-14T21:56:51.125903Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-14T22:00:23.447857Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"test_df","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-14T22:00:23.450778Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-14T22:00:23.451116Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-14T22:00:23.470397Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-14T22:00:23.451083Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-14T22:00:23.469321Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}

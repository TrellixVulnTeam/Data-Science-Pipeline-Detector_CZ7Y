This is definitely the most intuitive way, however price differences are not always comparable across stocks. For example, let's assume that we have invested  $ 1000 dollars in both stock A and stock B and that stock A moves from  $ 100 to  $ 102 and stock B moves from  $ 10 to  $ 11. We had a total of 10 shares of A ( $1000 / $100=10 ) which led to a profit of  10⋅($102−$100)=$20  and a total of 100 shares of B that yielded $100. So the price increase was larger for stock A, although the move was proportionally much larger for stock B.\n\nWe can solve the above problem by dividing the move by the starting price of the stock, effectively computing the percentage change in price, also known as the stock return. In our example, the return for stock A was  $102−$100$100=2% , while for stock B it was  $11−$10$10=10% . The stock return coincides with the percentage change in our invested capital.\n\nReturns are widely used in finance, however log returns are preferred whenever some mathematical modelling is required. Calling  St  the price of the stock  S  at time  t , we can define the log return between  t1  and  t2  as:\nrt1,t2=log(St2St1)\n \nUsually, we look at log returns over fixed time intervals, so with 10-minute log return we mean  rt=rt−10min,t .\n\nLog returns present several advantages, for example:\n\nthey are additive across time  rt1,t2+rt2,t3=rt1,t3 \nregular returns cannot go below -100%, while log returns are not bounded","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def log_return(list_stock_prices):\n    return np.log(list_stock_prices).diff() ","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-30T12:53:18.249247Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-30T12:53:18.249849Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-30T12:53:18.255087Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-30T12:53:18.249797Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-30T12:53:18.253982Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"book.loc[:,'log_return'] = log_return(book['wap'])\nbook = book[~book['log_return'].isnull()]","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-08-30T12:53:51.568553Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-08-30T12:53:51.569037Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-08-30T12:53:51.578866Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-08-30T12:53:51.568999Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-08-30T12:53:51.577609Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Realized volatility**\n\nWhen we trade options, a valuable input to our models is the standard deviation of the stock log returns.

These days, it's extremely rare for people to write their own samplers.  Instead, higher level modeling languages like PyMC3 and Stan are used to specify the model with a back-end \"inference engine\" doing the sampling.  \n\nHowever, learning how to specify models properly and using the high-level tools to fit them still requires overcoming a learning curve and thinking a bit differently than the traditional data science workflow, so here's a notebook to help get started.  \n\nI actually prefer Stan, but the Spike-and-Slab model has discrete parameters that are not possible to fit.  \n\nEDIT:  I've changed the prior on the coefficients to StudentT(3,0,1).  We don't want to over-regularize the included variables.  \n\nEDIT (again):  A normal prior works even better.  For .86 score, use p=.05 for hyperprior on `xi` and N(0,.75) as a prior for `beta`."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"b74ff177a35c7ccba2f008caf374fd0f9c6f4e07"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Package Imports\nPyMC3 uses the now semi-orphaned theano for the backend.

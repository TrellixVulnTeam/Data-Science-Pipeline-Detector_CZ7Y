We created synthetic data where all 300 variables are **useless** and target is randomly generated. In a sample size of 250 (like training dataset), by complete random chance many variables could predict target with CV as high as 0.640 by themselves. When we applied logistic regression with L1-penaltiy on all 300 **useless** varialbles, it obtained CV 0.690. Thus CV indicated things that did not exist. \n  \nOn the otherhand, in a sample size of 1975 (like the public test dataset), no **useless** variable could predict target with LB greater than 0.540 by itself. And when logistic regression with L1-penalty was performed on all 300 **useless** variables, it could not find any patterns and only reported LB 0.510.  \n  \nThis demonstrates that we can trust LB but we must be careful trusting CV. The real data contains variables that are **useful**. Useful variables will be able to predict target by themselves with AUC between 0.54 and 0.64 and above. When **useful** variables are present in the training data, we **cannot** detect them because some **useless** variables also show CV between 0.54 and 0.64 (like **useful** variables). However when these variables are present in the public data, we **can** detect them because **useless** variables have LB below 0.54 while **useful** variables have LB above 0.54"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Appendix : How many real variables are useful?\nIn this appendix, we will attempt to calculate how many real \"Don't Overfit II\" variables are useful. First let's find the standard deviation of AUC for **useless** variables in a training dataset with 250 observations. We will find a 80% confidence interval.  \n  \nWe will calculate AUC with `roc_auc_score(target,variable)`. Therefore if a variable is postively correlated with target, it will obtain a high `AUC > 0.5`. And if a variable is negatively correlated with target, it will obtain a low `AUC < 0.5`.

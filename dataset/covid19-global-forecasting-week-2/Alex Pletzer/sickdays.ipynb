Here $S$ is the number of susceptible people who have not yet been exposed to the virus, $I$ is the number of infected people who can transmit the disease and $t$ is time. The total population $N - S + I + R$, where $R$ is the number of people who have recovered and are no longer infectious, is a constant. \n\nThe critical parameters of the model are $\\beta$ (the rate of infection or transmission) and $\\gamma$ the rate of recovery. The aim of this notebook is to provide estimates for $\\beta$ and $\\gamma$ from the covid19-global-forecasting dataset.

Note: Self inflicted damage is subtracted.\n- headshotKills - Number of enemy players killed with headshots.\n- heals - Number of healing items used.\n- Id - Player’s Id\n- killPlace - Ranking in match of number of enemy players killed.\n- killPoints - Kills-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only kills matter.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in killPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n- killStreaks - Max number of enemy players killed in a short amount of time.\n- kills - Number of enemy players killed.\n- longestKill - Longest distance between player and player killed at time of death. This may be misleading, as downing a player and driving away may lead to a large longestKill stat.\n- matchDuration - Duration of match in seconds.\n- matchId - ID to identify match. There are no matches that are in both the training and testing set.\n- matchType - String identifying the game mode that the data comes from. The standard modes are “solo”, “duo”, “squad”, “solo-fpp”, “duo-fpp”, and “squad-fpp”; other modes are from events or custom matches.\n- rankPoints - Elo-like ranking of player. This ranking is inconsistent and is being deprecated in the API’s next version, so use with caution. Value of -1 takes place of “None”.\n- revives - Number of times this player revived teammates.\n- rideDistance - Total distance traveled in vehicles measured in meters.\n- roadKills - Number of kills while in a vehicle.\n- swimDistance - Total distance traveled by swimming measured in meters.\n- teamKills - Number of times this player killed a teammate.\n- vehicleDestroys - Number of vehicles destroyed.\n- walkDistance - Total distance traveled on foot measured in meters.\n- weaponsAcquired - Number of weapons picked up.\n- winPoints - Win-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only winning matters.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in winPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n- groupId - ID to identify a group within a match. If the same group of players plays in different matches, they will have a different groupId each time.\n- numGroups - Number of groups we have data for in the match.\n- maxPlace - Worst placement we have data for in the match. This may not match with numGroups, as sometimes the data skips over placements.\n- winPlacePerc - The target of prediction. This is a percentile winning placement, where 1 corresponds to 1st place, and 0 corresponds to last place in the match. It is calculated off of maxPlace, not numGroups, so it is possible to have missing chunks in a match.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### How many id in train data?"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_train['Id'].nunique()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### How many id in test data?"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_test['Id'].nunique()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Check null value"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_train.isnull().sum()  ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_test.isnull().sum()  ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check row with NaN value\ndf_train[df_train['winPlacePerc'].isnull()]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Delete this player\ndf_train.drop(2744604, inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#create minute column\ndf_train['matchDuration_min'] = df_train['matchDuration']/60","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Casestudy question\n- [Number knock by headshot more 10 headshot?](#Number-knock-by-headshot-more-10-headshot-?)\n- [The survivor death in 6 minute](#The-survivor-death-in-6-minute)\n- [The Fast killer](#The-Fast-killer)\n- [Number of death race](#Number-of-death-race)\n- [If you more walkDistance you get more kill?](#If-you-more-walkDistance-you-get-more-kill-?)\n- [The distance for a professional killer](#The-distance-for-a-professional-killer)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Number knock by headshot more 10 headshot ?"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"headshot = df_train[df_train['headshotKills'] >10]\nplt.figure(figsize=(15,10))\nsns.countplot(x = 'headshotKills',data = headshot)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## The survivor death in 6 minute"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = df_train.copy()\ndata = data[(data['DBNOs']==0)  & (data['matchDuration_min'] < 6)]\nplt.figure(figsize=(15,10))\nsns.distplot(data['matchDuration_min'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Some player have a problem find weapon or stay relax  within 6 minute they are killed."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## The Fast killer"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = df_train.copy()\ndata = data[data['matchDuration_min'] < data['matchDuration_min'].mean()]\nplt.figure(figsize=(15,10))\nsns.distplot(data['DBNOs'])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"If game start the enemy in front of you is killed by your gun.

Disclaimer</div>**\n\nIf you want to see the clean and short version of my work, **go here : https://www.kaggle.com/toldo171/pubg-top-35-with-lgbm**\nThis kernel contains my whole thinking process (thus it is also a mess :-) ).\n\n## **<div id=\"I\">I. Define the problem</div>**\n\n### **<div id=\"I1\">1. Problem description</div>**\n\nBattle Royale-style video games have taken the world by storm. 100 players are dropped onto an island empty-handed and must explore, scavenge, and eliminate other players until only one is left standing, all while the play zone continues to shrink.\n\nPlayerUnknown's BattleGrounds (PUBG) has enjoyed massive popularity. With over 50 million copies sold, it's the fifth best selling game of all time, and has millions of active monthly players.\n\nThe team at PUBG has made official game data available for the public to explore and scavenge outside of \"The Blue Circle.\" This competition is not an official or affiliated PUBG site - Kaggle collected data made possible through the PUBG Developer API.\n\nYou are given over 65,000 games' worth of anonymized player data, split into training and testing sets, and asked to predict final placement from final in-game stats and initial player ratings.\n\nWhat's the best strategy to win in PUBG? Should you sit in one spot and hide your way into victory, or do you need to be the top shot? Let's let the data do the talking!\n\nIn a PUBG game, up to 100 players start in each match (matchId). Players can be on teams (groupId) which get ranked at the end of the game (winPlacePerc) based on how many other teams are still alive when they are eliminated. In game, players can pick up different munitions, revive downed-but-not-out (knocked) teammates, drive vehicles, swim, run, shoot, and experience all of the consequences -- such as falling too far or running themselves over and eliminating themselves.\n\nYou are provided with a large number of anonymized PUBG game stats, formatted so that each row contains one player's post-game stats. The data comes from matches of all types: solos, duos, squads, and custom; there is no guarantee of there being 100 players per match, nor at most 4 player per group.\n\nYou must create a model which predicts players' finishing placement based on their final stats, on a scale from 1 (first place) to 0 (last place). \n\n#### **Data fields**\n\n* **DBNOs** - Number of enemy players knocked.\n* **assists** - Number of enemy players this player damaged that were killed by teammates.\n* **boosts** - Number of boost items used.\n* **damageDealt** - Total damage dealt. Note: Self inflicted damage is subtracted.\n* **headshotKills** - Number of enemy players killed with headshots.\n* **heals** - Number of healing items used.\n* **Id** - Player’s Id\n* **killPlace** - Ranking in match of number of enemy players killed.\n* **killPoints** - Kills-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only kills matter.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in killPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n* **killStreaks** - Max number of enemy players killed in a short amount of time.\n* **kills** - Number of enemy players killed.\n* **longestKill** - Longest distance between player and player killed at time of death. This may be misleading, as downing a player and driving away may lead to a large longestKill stat.\n* **matchDuration** - Duration of match in seconds.\n* **matchId** - ID to identify match. There are no matches that are in both the training and testing set.\n* **matchType** - String identifying the game mode that the data comes from. The standard modes are “solo”, “duo”, “squad”, “solo-fpp”, “duo-fpp”, and “squad-fpp”; other modes are from events or custom matches.\n* **rankPoints** - Elo-like ranking of player. This ranking is inconsistent and is being deprecated in the API’s next version, so use with caution. Value of -1 takes place of “None”.\n* **revives** - Number of times this player revived teammates.\n* **rideDistance** - Total distance traveled in vehicles measured in meters.\n* **roadKills** - Number of kills while in a vehicle.\n* **swimDistance** - Total distance traveled by swimming measured in meters.\n* **teamKills** - Number of times this player killed a teammate.\n* **vehicleDestroys** - Number of vehicles destroyed.\n* **walkDistance** - Total distance traveled on foot measured in meters.\n* **weaponsAcquired** - Number of weapons picked up.\n* **winPoints** - Win-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only winning matters.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in winPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n* **groupId** - ID to identify a group within a match. If the same group of players plays in different matches, they will have a different groupId each time.\n* **numGroups** - Number of groups we have data for in the match.\n* **maxPlace** - Worst placement we have data for in the match. This may not match with numGroups, as sometimes the data skips over placements.\n* **winPlacePerc** - The target of prediction. This is a percentile winning placement, where 1 corresponds to 1st place, and 0 corresponds to last place in the match. It is calculated off of maxPlace, not numGroups, so it is possible to have missing chunks in a match.\n\n\n### **<div id=\"I2\">2. Methodology</div>**\n\n* **1. Define the Problem**: If data science, big data, machine learning, predictive analytics, business intelligence, or any other buzzword is the solution, then what is the problem? As the saying goes, don't put the cart before the horse. Problems before requirements, requirements before solutions, solutions before design, and design before technology. Too often we are quick to jump on the new shiny technology, tool, or algorithm before determining the actual problem we are trying to solve.\n* **2. Gather the Data**: John Naisbitt wrote in his 1984 (yes, 1984) book Megatrends, we are “drowning in data, yet staving for knowledge.\" So, chances are, the dataset(s) already exist somewhere, in some format. It may be external or internal, structured or unstructured, static or streamed, objective or subjective, etc. As the saying goes, you don't have to reinvent the wheel, you just have to know where to find it. In the next step, we will worry about transforming \"dirty data\" to \"clean data.\"\n* **3. Prepare Data for Consumption**: This step is often referred to as data wrangling, a required process to turn “wild” data into “manageable” data. Data wrangling includes implementing data architectures for storage and processing, developing data governance standards for quality and control, data extraction (i.e. ETL and web scraping), and data cleaning to identify aberrant, missing, or outlier data points.\n* **4. Perform Exploratory Analysis**: Anybody who has ever worked with data knows, garbage-in, garbage-out (GIGO). Therefore, it is important to deploy descriptive and graphical statistics to look for potential problems, patterns, classifications, correlations and comparisons in the dataset. In addition, data categorization (i.e. qualitative vs quantitative) is also important to understand and select the correct hypothesis test or data model.\n* **5. Model Data**: Like descriptive and inferential statistics, data modeling can either summarize the data or predict future outcomes. Your dataset and expected results, will determine the algorithms available for use. It's important to remember, algorithms are tools and not magical wands or silver bullets. You must still be the master craft (wo)man that knows how-to select the right tool for the job. An analogy would be asking someone to hand you a Philip screwdriver, and they hand you a flathead screwdriver or worst a hammer. At best, it shows a complete lack of understanding. At worst, it makes completing the project impossible. The same is true in data modelling. The wrong model can lead to poor performance at best and the wrong conclusion (that’s used as actionable intelligence) at worst.\n* **6. Validate and Implement Data Model**: After you've trained your model based on a subset of your data, it's time to test your model. This helps ensure you haven't overfit your model or made it so specific to the selected subset, that it does not accurately fit another subset from the same dataset. In this step we determine if our model overfit, generalize, or underfit our dataset.\n* **7. Optimize and Strategize**: This is the \"bionic man\" step, where you iterate back through the process to make it better...stronger...faster than it was before. As a data scientist, your strategy should be to outsource developer operations and application plumbing, so you have more time to focus on recommendations and design. Once you're able to package your ideas, this becomes your “currency exchange\" rate.\n\n### **<div id=\"I3\">3.

Wrangle, cleanse and prepare Data for Consumption</div>**\n\n### **<div id=\"III0\">0. Reminder: the 4 C's of data cleaning</div>**\n\n* **Correcting**: Reviewing the data, there does not appear to be any aberrant or non-acceptable data inputs. In addition, we see we may have potential outliers in age and fare. However, since they are reasonable values, we will wait until after we complete our exploratory analysis to determine if we should include or exclude from the dataset. It should be noted, that if they were unreasonable values, for example age = 800 instead of 80, then it's probably a safe decision to fix now. However, we want to use caution when we modify data from its original value, because it may be necessary to create an accurate model.\n* **Completing**: There are null values or missing data in the age, cabin, and embarked field. Missing values can be bad, because some algorithms don't know how-to handle null values and will fail. While others, like decision trees, can handle null values. Thus, it's important to fix before we start modeling, because we will compare and contrast several models. There are two common methods, either delete the record or populate the missing value using a reasonable input. It is not recommended to delete the record, especially a large percentage of records, unless it truly represents an incomplete record. Instead, it's best to impute missing values. A basic methodology for qualitative data is impute using mode. A basic methodology for quantitative data is impute using mean, median, or mean + randomized standard deviation. An intermediate methodology is to use the basic methodology based on specific criteria; like the average age by class or embark port by fare and SES. There are more complex methodologies, however before deploying, it should be compared to the base model to determine if complexity truly adds value.\n* **Creating**: Feature engineering is when we use existing features to create new features to determine if they provide new signals to predict our outcome.\n* **Converting**: Last, but certainly not least, we'll deal with formatting. There are no date or currency formats, but datatype formats. Our categorical data imported as objects, which makes it difficult for mathematical calculations."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"3ac269f73912304b970c3a82ecbb3ff6e83e4892"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **<div id=\"III1\">1.

Modeling</div>**\n\nLogistic Regression is a useful model to run early in the workflow. Logistic regression measures the relationship between the categorical dependent variable (feature) and one or more independent variables (features) by estimating probabilities using a logistic function, which is the cumulative logistic distribution.\n\n#### **a. Cross validation**\n\nFor a prediction problem, a model is generally provided with a data set of known data, called the training data set, and a set of unknown data against which the model is tested, known as the test data set. The target is to have a data set for testing the model in the training phase and then provide insight on how the specific model adapts to an independent data set. A round of cross-validation comprises the partitioning of data into complementary subsets, then performing analysis on one subset. After this, the analysis is validated on other subsets (testing sets). To reduce variability, many rounds of cross-validation are performed using many different partitions and then an average of the results are taken. **Cross-validation is a powerful technique in the estimation of model performance technique.**\n\nHere, we are using the ShuffleSplit function from Scikit Learn. ShuffleSplit will randomly sample your entire dataset during each iteration to generate a training set and a test set. The test_size and train_size parameters control how large the test and training test set should be for each iteration. Since you are sampling from the entire dataset during each iteration, values selected during one iteration, could be selected again during another iteration.  \n\nThe main difference between ShuffleSplit and K-Fold is that In KFold, during each round you will use one fold as the test set and all the remaining folds as your training set. However, in ShuffleSplit, during each round n you should only use the training and test set from iteration n. **As your data set grows, cross validation time increases, making shufflesplits a more attractive alternate**. If you can train your algorithm, with a certain percentage of your data as opposed to using all k-1 folds, ShuffleSplit is an attractive option."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"b522d0f8625a8af1ac032181feff0056098bdac0","scrolled":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"models = [ \n    RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=10, criterion = 'mse', oob_score = True, random_state = 1)\n    ]\n\nmodel_results = pd.DataFrame(data = {'test_score_mean': [], 'fit_time_mean': [], 'mean_absolute_error': []})\n\n# Spliting the model\ncross_validation_split = model_selection.ShuffleSplit(n_splits = 5, test_size = .3, train_size = .6, random_state = 0 )\n# Performing shufflesplit cross validation, with the whole training set (the cross_validate function coupled with ShuffleSplit take care of spliting the training set) \n#for model in models:\n    #cross_validation_results = model_selection.cross_validate(model, X_train_truncated, y_train_truncated, \n                                                              cv= cross_validation_split, return_train_score=True)\n    #Predicts the target value on the whole training set\n    y_hat = model.fit(X_train_truncated, y_train_truncated).predict(X_train)    \n    # Checking the mean of test scores for each iteration of the validation    \n    model_results = model_results.append({'test_score_mean' : cross_validation_results['test_score'].mean(), \n                                          'fit_time_mean' : cross_validation_results['fit_time'].mean(), \n                                          'mean_absolute_error' : mean_absolute_error(y_train, y_hat)}, ignore_index=True) \n \nmodel_results","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6675af9bcf7948de851ca5c10b2d73a60dd51bb7"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### **b. Tune Model with Hyper-Parameters**\n\nIn machine learning, a hyperparameter is a parameter whose value is set before the learning process begins. By contrast, the values of other parameters are derived via training.\n\nDifferent model training algorithms require different hyperparameters, some simple algorithms (such as ordinary least squares regression) require none. Given these hyperparameters, the training algorithm learns the parameters from the data. Model hyperparameters are set manually and are used in processes to help estimate model parameters.\n**Tuning an hyperparameter means trying to get the closest possible to its best value, in order to maximize the accuracy of the model** (for larger dataset, time computing may also be taken into account for parameter tuning).\n\nFirst, we are using **RandomizedSearchCV**. We need to create a parameter grid to sample from during fitting. On each iteration, the algorithm will choose a difference combination of the features.

Model data, attempt n°3: Light GBM</div>**\n\n**LightGBM** is a relatively new algorithm. It is a gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithm. Light GBM grows tree vertically while other algorithm grows trees horizontally meaning that Light GBM grows tree leaf-wise while other algorithm grows level-wise. It will choose the leaf with max delta loss to grow. When growing the same leaf, Leaf-wise algorithm can reduce more loss than a level-wise algorithm. Light GBM is prefixed as ‘Light’ because of its high speed. Light GBM can handle the large size of data and takes lower memory to run. Another reason of why Light GBM is popular is because it focuses on accuracy of results. LGBM also supports GPU learning and thus data scientists are widely using LGBM for data science application development.\n\nUseful Ressources: \n* https://medium.com/@pushkarmandot/https-medium-com-pushkarmandot-what-is-lightgbm-how-to-implement-it-how-to-fine-tune-the-parameters-60347819b7fc\n* https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python-API.html#scikit-learn-api\n* https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Parameters.html\n\n### **<div id=\"VII1\">1.

{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Introduction\n\n### Challenge description\n\nIn a PUBG game, up to 100 players start in each match (matchId). Players can be on teams (groupId) which get ranked at the end of the game (winPlacePerc) based on how many other teams are still alive when they are eliminated. In game, players can pick up different munitions, revive downed-but-not-out (knocked) teammates, drive vehicles, swim, run, shoot, and experience all of the consequences -- such as falling too far or running themselves over and eliminating themselves.\n\nYou are provided with a large number of anonymized PUBG game stats, formatted so that each row contains one player's post-game stats. The data comes from matches of all types: solos, duos, squads, and custom; there is no guarantee of there being 100 players per match, nor at most 4 player per group.\n\nYou must create a model which predicts players' finishing placement based on their final stats, on a scale from 1 (first place) to 0 (last place).\n\n### PUBG Gameplay description\n\nBattlegrounds is a player versus player shooter game in which up to one hundred players fight in a battle royale, a type of large-scale last man standing deathmatch where players fight to remain the last alive. Players can choose to enter the match solo, duo, or with a small team of up to four people. The last person or team alive wins the match.\n\nEach match starts with players parachuting from a plane onto one of the four maps, with areas of approximately 8 × 8 kilometres (5.0 × 5.0 mi), 6 × 6 kilometres (3.7 × 3.7 mi), and 4 × 4 kilometres (2.5 × 2.5 mi) in size. The plane's flight path across the map varies with each round, requiring players to quickly determine the best time to eject and parachute to the ground. Players start with no gear beyond customized clothing selections which do not affect gameplay. Once they land, players can search buildings, ghost towns and other sites to find weapons, vehicles, armor, and other equipment. These items are procedurally distributed throughout the map at the start of a match, with certain high-risk zones typically having better equipment. Killed players can be looted to acquire their gear as well. Players can opt to play either from the first-person or third-person perspective, each having their own advantages and disadvantages in combat and situational awareness; though server-specific settings can be used to force all players into one perspective to eliminate some advantages.\n\nEvery few minutes, the playable area of the map begins to shrink down towards a random location, with any player caught outside the safe area taking damage incrementally, and eventually being eliminated if the safe zone is not entered in time; in game, the players see the boundary as a shimmering blue wall that contracts over time. This results in a more confined map, in turn increasing the chances of encounters. During the course of the match, random regions of the map are highlighted in red and bombed, posing a threat to players who remain in that area. In both cases, players are warned a few minutes before these events, giving them time to relocate to safety. A plane will fly over various parts of the playable map occasionally at random, or wherever a player uses a flare gun, and drop a loot package, containing items which are typically unobtainable during normal gameplay. These packages emit highly visible red smoke, drawing interested players near it and creating further confrontations. On average, a full round takes no more than 30 minutes.\n\nAt the completion of each round, players gain in-game currency based on their performance. The currency is used to purchase crates which contain cosmetic items for character or weapon customization. A rotating \"event mode\" was added to the game in March 2018. These events change up the normal game rules, such as establishing larger teams or squads, or altering the distribution of weapons and armor across the game map.\n\nSource: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayerUnknown%27s_Battlegrounds)\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Exploratory Data Analysis"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Loading train data"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt # data visualization\nimport seaborn as sns # data visualization\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import KFold\nfrom sklearn import svm\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\nfrom sklearn import linear_model\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor\nfrom sklearn.datasets import make_regression\nimport time\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train = pd.read_csv('../input/train_V2.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's take a quick look at the features and look for NaN values."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.tail()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Searching for null values..."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"Total of NaN values on train dataset: \", train.isna().sum().sum())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"So let's find that row."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.isna().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train[train.isna().any(axis=1)]","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This case seems like a unique case where only one player connected to the server.

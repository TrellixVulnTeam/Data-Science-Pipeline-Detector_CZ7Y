Similar to other popular games on the esport scene, PUBG is also based on a mod created for ARMA 2 called “DayZ: Battle Royale” by Brendan “PlayerUnknown” Greene.\n\n<img src='https://www.esportsguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/playerunknown-s-battlegrounds-characters-pubg-artwork-1024x576.jpeg'/>\n\nThe whole concept of a Battle Royale game mode is heavily inspired by the Japanese film “Battle Royale” in which a group of students are transferred to an island and forced to fight to death by their government. The game was released for Microsoft Windows via the Steam platform, and it was initially released as an early access game in March 2017. The game was fully developed and released on December 20, 2017. Ever since, it has had several releases on different platforms, such as PS4 and Xbox One but also for mobile devices.\n\nPlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds sends up to 100 players to an island via air transfer and it’s up to all individual players to decide when to parachute onto the island where they instantly need to scavenge and loot buildings and smaller compounds for weapons and equipment that they need to use for surviving and eliminating their enemies. In early game, the map is very big, but the playable area is slowly decreasing over time.\n\nBeing outside the playable area will slowly inflict damage on players until they either die or manage to run into the playable area before all their health is lost. The game can be played in Solo, Duo or Squad mode with up to 4 players. The goal of the game is obviously to be the last one standing to get the win.\n\nIt’s a very intense and exciting game which will keep you on your toes from start to finish. It also forces players to be more cautious and strategic than in your general run-and-gun shooter game. The game was praised on its release, even though it was released with a list of irritating bugs and server issues, it still managed to get a really good traction via big twitch streamers that popularized the game very quickly."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df=pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/pubg-finish-placement-prediction/train_V2.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Let's take a look at the data"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Column description:\n* DBNOs - Number of enemy players knocked.\n* assists - Number of enemy players this player damaged that were killed by teammates.\n* boosts - Number of boost items used.\n* damageDealt - Total damage dealt.

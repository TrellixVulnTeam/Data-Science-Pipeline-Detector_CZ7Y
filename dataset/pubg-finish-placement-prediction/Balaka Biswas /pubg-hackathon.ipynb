Every PUBG player will agree to the immense, unparalleled happiness washing through on winning a victory(a 'Chicken dinner', in PUBG lingo). As much as it is relaxing, it is addictive too. So in this notebook, I have derived conclusions on some of the most important factors affecting victory in a PUBG match.\n\nA. WHAT NOT TO DO AT PUBG ?\n\n*  Never opt for Squad-FPP matches unless very sure of your communication skills. Analysis shows that Squad-FPP players tend to lose more games. A major reason behind them could be miscommunication, as Squad FPPs form random teams with players across the globe.\n*  Never opt for a duo match, as analysis shows none of the players under observation won in a duo match.\n*  Never stop at just one kill. Analytics shows that players with less than 2 kills got gunned down.\n*  Never hide from the very beginning of the game. Analaysis shows that people with zero walking distance lose more.\n*  Never take a ride, as you are in risk of a road kill. Also, avoid swimming too. Analysis shows they contribiute very feebly to victory.\n*  Never pick on a battle with a stronger opponent. The number of opponents you kill is not much related to winning.\n\nB. WHAT TO DO AT PUBG TO WIN ?\n*  Opt for Squad matches. Analysis shows they are the 3rd most popular match type, yet guarantee more victory than Squad-FPP. This is because, in squad matches, you get to form or choose your own team and communication is thus easier if you are playing with your friends.\n*  Opt for Duo-FPP matches, as analysis says that they offer the highest victory rate.\n*  Kill as many people as you can without getting gunned down. Analysis shows that number of kills and win percentages are moderately correlated.  If you feel the situation is safe, kill strategically. Like, if you have a shotgun, fight someone with a shotgun and not a higher level weapon. And the more you kill, the more vests and weapons you collect ;)\n*  As long as you are not in danger, analysis shows that inflicting more damage showcases a player's skills and usually ensures a good score.\n*  Prefer walking or running than swimming or riding. Data tells us that the peak of victory comes with moderately high walking distance.\n*  Indulge in picking up more boosts and healing items, as both are strongly correlated to victory.\n*  Pick battles wisely. Fight enemies you are sure you can gun down.\n\nTHANK YOU :)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

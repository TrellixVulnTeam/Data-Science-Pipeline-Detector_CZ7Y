Note: Self inflicted damage is subtracted.\n* headshotKills - Number of enemy players killed with headshots.\n* heals - Number of healing items used.\n* Id - Player’s Id\n* killPlace - Ranking in match of number of enemy players killed.\n* killPoints - Kills-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only kills matter.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in killPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n* killStreaks - Max number of enemy players killed in a short amount of time.\n* kills - Number of enemy players killed.\n* longestKill - Longest distance between player and player killed at time of death. This may be misleading, as downing a player and driving away may lead to a large longestKill stat.\n* matchDuration - Duration of match in seconds.\n* matchId - ID to identify match. There are no matches that are in both the training and testing set.\n* matchType - String identifying the game mode that the data comes from. The standard modes are “solo”, “duo”, “squad”, “solo-fpp”, “duo-fpp”, and “squad-fpp”; other modes are from events or custom matches.\n* rankPoints - Elo-like ranking of player. This ranking is inconsistent and is being deprecated in the API’s next version, so use with caution. Value of -1 takes place of “None”.\n* revives - Number of times this player revived teammates.\n* rideDistance - Total distance traveled in vehicles measured in meters.\n* roadKills - Number of kills while in a vehicle.\n* swimDistance - Total distance traveled by swimming measured in meters.\n* teamKills - Number of times this player killed a teammate.\n* vehicleDestroys - Number of vehicles destroyed.\n* walkDistance - Total distance traveled on foot measured in meters.\n* weaponsAcquired - Number of weapons picked up.\n* winPoints - Win-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only winning matters.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in winPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n* groupId - ID to identify a group within a match. If the same group of players plays in different matches, they will have a different groupId each time.\n* numGroups - Number of groups we have data for in the match.\n* maxPlace - Worst placement we have data for in the match. This may not match with numGroups, as sometimes the data skips over placements.\n* winPlacePerc - The target of prediction. This is a percentile winning placement, where 1 corresponds to 1st place, and 0 corresponds to last place in the match. It is calculated off of maxPlace, not numGroups, so it is possible to have missing chunks in a match."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_train.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"List all the independent values which are useful to predict"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_columns = ['assists', 'boosts', 'damageDealt', 'DBNOs', 'headshotKills', \n                  'heals', 'killPlace', 'killPoints', 'kills', 'killStreaks', \n                  'longestKill', 'maxPlace', 'numGroups', 'revives','rideDistance', \n                  'roadKills', 'swimDistance', 'teamKills', 'vehicleDestroys', 'walkDistance', \n                  'weaponsAcquired', 'winPoints']","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Write a function to iterate through all the columns of a dataframe and modify the data type in order to reduce memory usage.

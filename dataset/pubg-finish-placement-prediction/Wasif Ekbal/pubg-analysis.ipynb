Similar to other popular games on the esport scene, PUBG is also based on a mod created for ARMA 2 called “DayZ: Battle Royale” by Brendan “PlayerUnknown” Greene.\n\n\n\nThe whole concept of a Battle Royale game mode is heavily inspired by the Japanese film “Battle Royale” in which a group of students are transferred to an island and forced to fight to death by their government. The game was released for Microsoft Windows via the Steam platform, and it was initially released as an early access game in March 2017. The game was fully developed and released on December 20, 2017. Ever since, it has had several releases on different platforms, such as PS4 and Xbox One but also for mobile devices.\n\nPlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds sends up to 100 players to an island via air transfer and it’s up to all individual players to decide when to parachute onto the island where they instantly need to scavenge and loot buildings and smaller compounds for weapons and equipment that they need to use for surviving and eliminating their enemies. In early game, the map is very big, but the playable area is slowly decreasing over time.\n\nBeing outside the playable area will slowly inflict damage on players until they either die or manage to run into the playable area before all their health is lost. The game can be played in Solo, Duo or Squad mode with up to 4 players. The goal of the game is obviously to be the last one standing to get the win.\n\nIt’s a very intense and exciting game which will keep you on your toes from start to finish. It also forces players to be more cautious and strategic than in your general run-and-gun shooter game. The game was praised on its release, even though it was released with a list of irritating bugs and server issues, it still managed to get a really good traction via big twitch streamers that popularized the game very quickly."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"## Importing some libraries.\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nplt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### imporing the dataset and creating a backup of the dataset."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df=pd.read_csv('../input/pubg-finish-placement-prediction/train_V2.csv')\nreserved=df.copy()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Shape of the dataset."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Head of the dataset."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Info of the data."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### All the columns of the dataset."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.columns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Column description:\n- DBNOs - Number of enemy players knocked.\n- assists - Number of enemy players this player damaged that were killed by teammates.\n- boosts - Number of boost items used.\n- damageDealt - Total damage dealt.

(Think of this as an Elo ranking where only kills matter.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in killPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n- killStreaks - Max number of enemy players killed in a short amount of time.\n- kills - Number of enemy players killed.\n- longestKill - Longest distance between player and player killed at time of death. This may be misleading, as downing a player and driving away may lead to a large longestKill stat.\n- matchDuration - Duration of match in seconds.\n- matchId - ID to identify match. There are no matches that are in both the training and testing set.\n- matchType - String identifying the game mode that the data comes from. The standard modes are “solo”, “duo”, “squad”, “solo-fpp”, “duo-fpp”, and “squad-fpp”; other modes are from events or custom matches.\n- rankPoints - Elo-like ranking of player.

This may not match with numGroups, as sometimes the data skips over placements.\n- winPlacePerc - The target of prediction. This is a percentile winning placement, where 1 corresponds to 1st place, and 0 corresponds to last place in the match.

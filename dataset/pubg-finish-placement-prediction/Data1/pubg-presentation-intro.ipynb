Note: Self inflicted damage is subtracted.\n* headshotKills - Number of enemy players killed with headshots.\n* heals - Number of healing items used.\n* Id - Player’s Id\n* killPlace - Ranking in match of number of enemy players killed.\n* killPoints - Kills-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only kills matter.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in killPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n* killStreaks - Max number of enemy players killed in a short amount of time.\n* kills - Number of enemy players killed.\n* longestKill - Longest distance between player and player killed at time of death. This may be misleading, as downing a player and driving away may lead to a large longestKill stat.\n* matchDuration - Duration of match in seconds.\n* matchId - ID to identify match. There are no matches that are in both the training and testing set.\n* matchType - String identifying the game mode that the data comes from. The standard modes are “solo”, “duo”, “squad”, “solo-fpp”, “duo-fpp”, and “squad-fpp”; other modes are from events or custom matches.\n* rankPoints - Elo-like ranking of player. **This ranking is inconsistent and is being deprecated in the API’s next version, so use with caution.** Value of -1 takes place of “None”.\n* revives - Number of times this player revived teammates.\n* rideDistance - Total distance traveled in vehicles measured in meters.\n* roadKills - Number of kills while in a vehicle.\n* swimDistance - Total distance traveled by swimming measured in meters.\n* teamKills - Number of times this player killed a teammate.\n* vehicleDestroys - Number of vehicles destroyed.\n* walkDistance - Total distance traveled on foot measured in meters.\n* weaponsAcquired - Number of weapons picked up.\n* winPoints - Win-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only winning matters.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in winPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n* groupId - ID to identify a group within a match. If the same group of players plays in different matches, they will have a different groupId each time.\n* numGroups - Number of groups we have data for in the match.\n* maxPlace - Worst placement we have data for in the match. This may not match with numGroups, as sometimes the data skips over placements.\n* winPlacePerc - The target of prediction. This is a percentile winning placement, where 1 corresponds to 1st place, and 0 corresponds to last place in the match. It is calculated off of maxPlace, not numGroups, so it is possible to have missing chunks in a match."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Import libraries \nimport numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns \nimport os\nimport warnings\n\n%matplotlib inline\nwarnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Set the size of the plots \nplt.rcParams[\"figure.figsize\"] = (18,8)\nsns.set(rc={'figure.figsize':(18,8)})","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv(\"../input/pubg-finish-placement-prediction/train_V2.csv\")\nprint(\"Finished loading the data\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Basic Assumptions and Observations\n\nRemove rank Points since notes on dataset said this feature is inconsistent and will be deprecated in later versions of the game"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.drop(columns=['rankPoints'], inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check to see what we are dealing with regarding missing and null values \ndata.isnull().values.any()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data.dropna(inplace=True)\ndata.isnull().values.any()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Check to see win percentage distribution \nsns.distplot(data['winPlacePerc']).set_title('Distribution of Winning Percentile');","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print('Mean: {:.4f}, Median {:.4f}'.format(data['winPlacePerc'].mean(), data['winPlacePerc'].median()))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Outside of the tails the distribution is uniform as one would expect \n\nHow about we now look at the mean and median based on the matchId"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data['matchMean'] = data.groupby('matchId')['winPlacePerc'].transform('mean')\ndata['matchMedian'] = data.groupby('matchId')['winPlacePerc'].transform('median')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.distplot(data['matchMean'], kde=False).set_title('Mean for Winning Percentile grouped by match');","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.distplot(data['matchMedian'], kde=False).set_title('Median for Winning Percentile grouped by match');","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Get values\nprint('Mean: {:.4f}, Median {:.4f}'.format(data['matchMean'].mean(), data['matchMedian'].median()))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's look into team sizes and match size "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Can do this with matchType and then derive the team and match size\ndata['matchType'].unique()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.countplot('matchType', data=data);","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data['teamSize'] = data.groupby('groupId')['groupId'].transform('count')\ndata['maxTeamSize'] = data.groupby('matchId')['teamSize'].transform('max')\ndata['matchSize'] = data.groupby('matchId')['Id'].transform('nunique')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.distplot(data['matchSize'], kde=False).set_title('Distribution of Players per Game');","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Looks like the frequency is a lot greater as you move towards 100 people in a match.

Note: Self inflicted damage is subtracted.\n- headshotKills - Number of enemy players killed with headshots.\n- heals - Number of healing items used.\n- Id - Player’s Id\n- killPlace - Ranking in match of number of enemy players killed.\n- killPoints - Kills-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only kills matter.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in killPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n- killStreaks - Max number of enemy players killed in a short amount of time.\n- kills - Number of enemy players killed.\n- longestKill - Longest distance between player and player killed at time of death. This may be misleading, as downing a player and driving away may lead to a large longestKill stat.\n- matchDuration - Duration of match in seconds.\n- matchId - ID to identify match. There are no matches that are in both the training and testing set.\n- matchType - String identifying the game mode that the data comes from. The standard modes are “solo”, “duo”, “squad”, “solo-fpp”, “duo-fpp”, and “squad-fpp”; other modes are from events or custom matches.\n- rankPoints - Elo-like ranking of player. This ranking is inconsistent and is being deprecated in the API’s next version, so use with caution. Value of -1 takes place of “None”.\n- revives - Number of times this player revived teammates.\n- rideDistance - Total distance traveled in vehicles measured in meters.\n- roadKills - Number of kills while in a vehicle.\n- swimDistance - Total distance traveled by swimming measured in meters.\n- teamKills - Number of times this player killed a teammate.\n- vehicleDestroys - Number of vehicles destroyed.\n- walkDistance - Total distance traveled on foot measured in meters.\n- weaponsAcquired - Number of weapons picked up.\n- winPoints - Win-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only winning matters.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in winPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n- groupId - ID to identify a group within a match. If the same group of players plays in different matches, they will have a different groupId each time.\n- numGroups - Number of groups we have data for in the match.\n- maxPlace - Worst placement we have data for in the match. This may not match with numGroups, as sometimes the data skips over placements.\n- winPlacePerc - The target of prediction. This is a percentile winning placement, where 1 corresponds to 1st place, and 0 corresponds to last place in the match. It is calculated off of maxPlace, not numGroups, so it is possible to have missing chunks in a match."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d7bb9c00-5b3c-45ec-b724-ffe31376baca","_cell_guid":"0a8995b1-689e-4f95-b24c-43a351cb04a0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_path = \"../input/train_V2.csv\"\ntrain_data = pd.read_csv(train_path, index_col=\"Id\")\ntrain_data.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"test_path = \"../input/test_V2.csv\"\ntest_data = pd.read_csv(test_path, index_col=\"Id\")\ntest_data.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train_data.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"columns = train_data.columns\nfor column in columns:\n    print(f\"{column}: {train_data[column].isna().sum()}\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"since there is only one row with null value, we can safely drop that row"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"data = train_data.copy()\ndata = data.dropna()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"columns = data.columns\nfor column in columns:\n    print(f\"{column}: {data[column].isna().sum()}\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"num_data = data.select_dtypes(include='number')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"num_data.info()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# plt.figure(figsize=(15, 15))\n# sns.heatmap(data=num_data.corr(), annot=True, fmt='.1f')\n# plt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# plt.figure(figsize=(15, 15))\n# sns.scatterplot(x=num_data.walkDistance, y=num_data.winPlacePerc)\n# plt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"from above plot we can say that as the walking distance of a player increases, chances of getting better placement increases.

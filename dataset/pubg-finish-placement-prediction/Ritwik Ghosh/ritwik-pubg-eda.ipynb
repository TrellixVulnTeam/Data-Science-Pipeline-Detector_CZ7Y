Try to avoid engaging enemy from close quarters. Always try to shoot enemies from a distance.\n2. Try to take proper position in the battle, especially by walking, since it is stealthier and harder to detect and hence increases the chance of having to face an enemy\n3. Fight enemies only when required, do not seek out extra enemies. Kill points make no difference to the outcome but a higher kill ranking (killPlace) results in a lower probability of winning.\n4. When required, kill an enemy, just not knock them out or damage them. There is very high correlation between damage dealt, players knocked out and kills, and all three have a high correlation with win percentage. This means it is best to make sure that the enemey is dead and not just injured.\n5. It is best to take an enemy out with a headshot because it has a positive correlation with winning. Combining this point with point 1, it is understood it is best to use a sniper to take enemies down from a distance to increase chances of winning\n6. Match duration has no correlation with winning. A match may be fought both quickly or by camping and hiding and it would not have much affect on the outcome.\n7. It is extremely helpful to take repeated boosts and keeping healed all the time. Both these factors have very high corellation with win percentage and therefore recommended.\n8. It does not make a difference on how many weapons a player has acquired, it has no correlation with win percentage. An average player uses 2-5 weapons in a match."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

Note: Self inflicted damage is subtracted.\n\nheadshotKills - Number of enemy players killed with headshots.\n\nheals - Number of healing items used.\n\nId - Player’s Id\n\nkillPlace - Ranking in match of number of enemy players killed.\n\nkillPoints - Kills-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only kills matter.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in killPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n\nkillStreaks - Max number of enemy players killed in a short amount of time.\n\nkills - Number of enemy players killed.\n\nlongestKill - Longest distance between player and player killed at time of death. This may be misleading, as downing a player and driving away may lead to a large longestKill stat.\n\nmatchDuration - Duration of match in seconds.\n\nmatchId - ID to identify match. There are no matches that are in both the training and testing set.\n\nmatchType - String identifying the game mode that the data comes from. The standard modes are “solo”, “duo”, “squad”, “solo-fpp”, “duo-fpp”, and “squad-fpp”; other modes are from events or custom matches.\n\nrankPoints - Elo-like ranking of player. This ranking is inconsistent and is being deprecated in the API’s next version, so use with caution. Value of -1 takes place of “None”.\n\nrevives - Number of times this player revived teammates.\n\nrideDistance - Total distance traveled in vehicles measured in meters.\n\nroadKills - Number of kills while in a vehicle.\n\nswimDistance - Total distance traveled by swimming measured in meters.\n\nteamKills - Number of times this player killed a teammate.\n\nvehicleDestroys - Number of vehicles destroyed.\n\nwalkDistance - Total distance traveled on foot measured in meters.\n\nweaponsAcquired - Number of weapons picked up.\n\nwinPoints - Win-based external ranking of player. (Think of this as an Elo ranking where only winning matters.) If there is a value other than -1 in rankPoints, then any 0 in winPoints should be treated as a “None”.\n\ngroupId - ID to identify a group within a match. If the same group of players plays in different matches, they will have a different groupId each time.\n\nnumGroups - Number of groups we have data for in the match.\n\nmaxPlace - Worst placement we have data for in the match. This may not match with numGroups, as sometimes the data skips over placements.\n\nwinPlacePerc - The target of prediction. This is a percentile winning placement, where 1 corresponds to 1st place, and 0 corresponds to last place in the match. It is calculated off of maxPlace, not numGroups, so it is possible to have missing chunks in a match.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Dataset Collection","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":" the data set has been collected from kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/pubg-finish-placement-prediction/data)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# About- Project","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In a PUBG game, up to 100 players start in each match (matchId).

Here's a summary of a few of them:\n\nI have got a very big dataset of around 4446966 entries.\n\nKilling- a average person kills 0.924783 players ,99% of people have 7.0 kills or less , the most kills ever recorded is 72.Most of the people in the game doesn't make a single kill in the game.16666 players have won without a single kill.4770 players have won without dealing damage.Apperently killing has a correlation with winning placement .\n\nWalking -A average person walks for 1154.2m.99% of people have walked 4396.0m or less.the marathon champion walked for 25780.0m.99603 players walked 0 meters.this means that they die before even taking a step.apperently walking has a high correlation with win place.\n\nDriving - The avg person drives for 606.115669154093m.99% of people have drived 6966.0m. or less.The formula 1 champion drived for 40710.0m.3309429 players drived for 0 meters.it seems that this 2 variables are slightly correlated .yes destoying a vehicle increases your chance of winning.\n\nSwimming -The avg person swims for 4.509322451307243m.99% of people have swimmed 123.0m or less.The olympic champion swimmed for 3823.0m.it seems that if you swim. you rise to the top. the pubg there are currently 3 maps . one of them has almost no water. keep that in mind . we might plan on doing analysis to find out in which map a match is played.\n\nHealing -The avg person uses 1.1069077209045448 boosts items.99% of people use 7.0 or less boosts.The max boosts used 33.so healing and boosting are definitely correlated with winplaceperce.boosting is more correlated. in every plot, there is as abnormal behavior when calues are\n\nthere are 3 game modes in the game . one can play solo , or with a friend ,duo, or with 3 other friends , squad, 100 players join the same server , so in the case of duos the max teams are 50 and in case of squads the max teams are 25.\nthere are 709111 (15.945950564946978%) solo games,there are 3295326 (74.10279278051597%) duo games,there are 442529 (15.945950564946978%) squad gmaes in the data.solos and duoes behave the same, but when playing squads kills don't matter that much.\nthe attribute DBNOs means enemy players knocked . A \"Knock\" can happen only in duos or squads.\nthe attribute assist can also happen only in duos pr squads. it generally means that the players had an involvement in a kill .\nthe attribute revive also happens in duos or squads\nWin Place perc A very high correlation between this 5 features  . boosting , weapon accuaring , damage dealt , walk distance , kill place .I have created  some more features watching the scenarios of the game which has high correlation with win place perc that are \"kills norm\" ,\" damage dealt \",\"healsandboosts\" , \"totalDistanc\" ,\"boostsper walk distance\" , \"heals per walk distance\" , \" kills per walk distance\" , \"solos\" ,\"duos\" ,\"squad\" & added them with the table .","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Future works -\nthis data analysis model project can be used to  develop the game and making the game more interesting .

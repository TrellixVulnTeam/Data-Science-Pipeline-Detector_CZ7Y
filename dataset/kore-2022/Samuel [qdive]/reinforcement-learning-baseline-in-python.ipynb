While you can of course try to build yourself\none of the RL models described in literature, chances are that you will spend more time debugging your model than actually competing.\n\n[stable-baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/#) is powerful RL library with a number of very nice features for this competition:\n- It implements the most popular modern deep RL algorithms\n- It is simple and ellegant to use\n- It is rather well documented\n- There are plenty of tutorials and examples\n\nIn other words, it's a fantastic starting point. Alas, it requires an environment compatible with OpenAI-gym and the kore environment is not. What you'll find in this notebook is **KoreGymEnv**, a wrapper around the kore env that makes it play nice with stable-baselines3. It includes very simple feature and action engineering, so the only thing you need to care about is building upon them, choosing a model and throwing yourself into the cold, unforgiving and yet very rewarding reinforcement learning waters ;)\n\nAs a bonus, this notebook also demonstrates the end-to-end process that you need to follow to submit any model with external dependencies. Click on submit and you're good to go.\n\n#### Notes:\n\n- In stable-baselines3, states and actions are numpy arrays. In the kore environment, states are lists of dicts and actions are dicts with shipyard ids as keys and shipyard actions as values. Thus, we need an interface to \"translate\" them. This interface is effectively where you implement your state & action engineering. You'll find more details in the KoreGymEnv class.\n- In the ideal case, you would use self-play and let your agent play a very large number of games against itself, improving at ever step. Unfortunately, [it is not clear how to implement self-play in the kore env](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/kore-2022/discussion/323382). So we have to train against static opponents. In this baseline, we'll use the starter bot. Of course, nothing prevents you from implementing pseudo-self-play and train against ever improving versions of your agent.","metadata":{"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true},"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## tl; dr\n\n```python\n# Train a PPO agent\nfrom environment import KoreGymEnv\nfrom stable_baselines3 import PPO\n\nkore_env = KoreGymEnv()\nmodel = PPO('MlpPolicy', kore_env, verbose=1)\nmodel.learn(total_timesteps=100000)\n```","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Dependencies","metadata":{"tags":[]}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install --target=lib --no-deps stable-baselines3 gym","metadata":{"tags":[],"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-20T06:10:15.237192Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-20T06:10:15.237527Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-20T06:10:41.788722Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-20T06:10:15.237443Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-20T06:10:41.787625Z"},"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### A note on dependencies\nThe kaggle notebook environment and the actual competition environment are different. I couldn't find any documentation on the differences other than through comments from more experienced kagglers. So let's take a minute to understand the cell below. I hope that this information saves fellow competitors a lot of time and trial-and-error!\n\n`stable-baselines` is not (yet) a part of the kaggle docker environment, so we have to install it manually. In the notebook environment, you start at `/kaggle/working/`, so the cell above installs the libraries into `/kaggle/working/lib/`. We have two options to load the library now, `import lib.stable-baselines3` or add `/kaggle/working/lib/` to [sys.path](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.path), which tells Python where look for modules.\n\nWhen you submit your agent as an archive, however, your code is unzipped to `/kaggle_simulations/agent/`, _but the working directory remains `/kaggle/working/`_. In the competition env, neither of the options above work, because `lib` isn't `/kaggle/working/lib` anymore, it has been unzipped with the rest of your code to `/kaggle_simulations/agent/lib`. Surprise!\n\nThe code below then checks whether we are in the simulation environment, and adds the right location of the external dependencies to `sys.path`.\n\nAdditionally, there is a limit on the submission size, that's why we are installing with `--no-deps` to keep the submission size small.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport sys\nKAGGLE_AGENT_PATH = \"/kaggle_simulations/agent/\"\nif os.path.exists(KAGGLE_AGENT_PATH):\n    sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(KAGGLE_AGENT_PATH, 'lib'))\nelse:\n    sys.path.insert(0, os.path.join(os.getcwd(), 'lib'))","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-20T06:10:41.79098Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-20T06:10:41.791246Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-20T06:10:41.797259Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-20T06:10:41.791213Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-20T06:10:41.796245Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Utils","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-20T06:52:15.416056Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-20T06:52:15.41672Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-20T06:52:15.421073Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-20T06:52:15.416679Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-20T06:52:15.420136Z"}}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Config","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%writefile config.py\nimport numpy as np\nfrom kaggle_environments import make\n\n# Read env specification\nENV_SPECIFICATION = make('kore_fleets').specification\nSHIP_COST = ENV_SPECIFICATION.configuration.spawnCost.default\nSHIPYARD_COST = ENV_SPECIFICATION.configuration.convertCost.default\nGAME_CONFIG = {\n    'episodeSteps':  ENV_SPECIFICATION.configuration.episodeSteps.default,  # You might want to start with smaller values\n    'size': ENV_SPECIFICATION.configuration.size.default,\n    'maxLogLength': None\n}\n\n# Define your opponent.

We then define the board value as the difference between\n    player's partial board values.\n    Flight plans and the positioning of fleet and shipyards do not flow into the board value (yet).\n\n    To keep things simple, we'll take a weighted sum as the partial board value.

Ship count won't help us win games in the latter stages, but it is crucial in the beginning.\n    Fleets and shipyards will be accounted for proportionally to their kore cost.\n\n    For efficiency, the weight factors are pre-computed at module level.

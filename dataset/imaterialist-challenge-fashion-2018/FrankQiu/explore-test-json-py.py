# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 
import os
import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)
import json


with open('../input/test.json', encoding='utf-8') as data_file:
    data = json.loads(data_file.read())


images = data.get('images')
# images is a list and in each image there is 'url' and 'imageId'


# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

# import os
# print(os.listdir("../input"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

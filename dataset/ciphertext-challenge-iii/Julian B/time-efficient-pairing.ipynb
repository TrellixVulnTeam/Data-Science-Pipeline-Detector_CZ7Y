Without this padding, you could create a straight forward hash table for quick lookups. One approach would be to systematically strip off the padding; this is possible, but not the easiest approach.\n\nLet's look at an example: how do we know the following two messages are a pair?"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"pt = \"9]8pVnN4n,DaA6[XNib4K2yVIn[jk[MW0VTo5?J62P?'.0HbpEnter, from one side, LUCIUS, IACHIMO, and  the Roman Army: from the other side, the  British Army, POSTHUMUS LEONATUS following,  like a poor soldier.

Now at this point, I probably could rewrite my code in C, parallelise it, and chuck it up to the cloud...but that doesn't sound like much fun. I'd prefer to come up with a solution that works on a single core of my 10 year old laptop, and takes no longer than me to make a cup of tea. **Let's work smarter rather than harder.**\n\nThe aim here is to make a [time-memory trade off](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time/memory/data_tradeoff_attack) such that pairing is quicker at the expense of memory. Grouping by length was a good approach, but the problem was there wasn't enough groups (only 8) and the messages were not spread evenly across them (99.9% in one!). Normally for this type of problem, my go to solution is [Locality Sensitive Hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing) which will ensure that messages end up in the right bucket with high probabiliy, but a probabilistic approach feels massively overkill here. \n\nInstead, let's design our own 'hash' function that will place messages into buckets. When I say 'hash', you might automatically think of [cryptographic hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function), but actually that's not want we want here: we do not want to encorporate the entire string into the hash (remember the padding), and hash collisons are desirable here.\n\nI'll present two hashing techniques I've tried out, and you can comment below if you can think of a better one. First off, notice that most of the words are the same in both strings I'm trying to pair: it's just the padding at the start and end which differs.

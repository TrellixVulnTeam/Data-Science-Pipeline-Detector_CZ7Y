The training set is available in the train/ folder, with corresponding landmark labels in train.csv. The test set images are listed in the test/ folder. Each image has a unique id. Since there are a large number of images, each image is placed within three subfolders according to the first three characters of the image id (i.e. image abcdef.jpg is placed in a/b/c/abcdef.jpg).","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.b Evaluation Metrics","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Submissions are evaluated using Global Average Precision (GAP) at k, where k=1. This metric is also known as micro Average Precision (Î¼\n\nAP), as per [1,2]. It works as follows:\n\nFor each test image, you will predict one landmark label and a corresponding confidence score. The evaluation treats each prediction as an individual data point in a long list of predictions (sorted in descending order by confidence scores), and computes the Average Precision based on this list.\n\nIf a submission has N\n\npredictions (label/confidence pairs) sorted in descending order by their confidence scores, then the Global Average Precision is computed as:\n\nGAP=(1/M)âˆ‘P(i)rel(i)\n\nwhere:\n\n* N is the total number of predictions returned by the system, across all queries\n* M is the total number of queries with at least one landmark from the training set visible in it (note that some queries may not depict landmarks)\n* P(i) is the precision at rank i\n* rel(i) denotes the relevance of prediciton i: itâ€™s 1 if the i-th prediction is correct, and 0 otherwise\n\nFor each id in the test set, you can predict at most one landmark and its corresponding confidence score. Some images contain no landmarks. You may decide not to predict any result for a given query, by submitting an empty prediction.

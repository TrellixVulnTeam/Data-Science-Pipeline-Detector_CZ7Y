This tutorial will introduce Dask and parallel data analysis more generally.\n\n\nDask provides multi-core and distributed parallel execution on larger-than-memory datasets.\n\n- **High-level collections:** Dask provides high-level Array, Bag, and DataFrame collections that mimic NumPy, lists, and Pandas but can operate in parallel on datasets that don’t fit into memory. Dask’s high-level collections are alternatives to NumPy and Pandas for large datasets.\n\n- **Low-level schedulers:** Dask provides dynamic task schedulers that execute task graphs in parallel. These execution engines power the high-level collections mentioned above but can also power custom, user-defined workloads. These schedulers are low-latency (around 1ms) and work hard to run computations in a small memory footprint. Dask’s schedulers are an alternative to direct use of threading or multiprocessing libraries in complex cases or other task scheduling systems like Luigi or IPython parallel.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install dask","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-26T05:29:59.288267Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-26T05:29:59.288742Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-26T05:30:12.281077Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-26T05:29:59.288698Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-26T05:30:12.279822Z"},"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### loading Train data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from dask import dataframe as dd\n\nstart = time.time()\ndask_df = dd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/amex-default-prediction/train_data.csv\")\nend = time.time()\nprint(f\"Total time Disk take to read the data is :- {end - start} sec\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-26T05:30:12.283629Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-26T05:30:12.284403Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-26T05:30:13.593452Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-26T05:30:12.284331Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-26T05:30:13.592597Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\ndask_df.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-26T05:40:55.907817Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-26T05:40:55.908278Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-26T05:40:57.031388Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-26T05:40:55.90824Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-26T05:40:57.030237Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\ndask_df.tail()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-26T05:41:00.98797Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-26T05:41:00.988445Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-26T05:41:02.022698Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-26T05:41:00.988406Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-26T05:41:02.021539Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"dask_df.shape","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-26T05:39:42.272963Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-26T05:39:42.273451Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-26T05:39:42.300805Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-26T05:39:42.273416Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-26T05:39:42.299696Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"dask_df.columns","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-26T05:40:18.427454Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-26T05:40:18.427899Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-26T05:40:18.435332Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-26T05:40:18.427862Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-26T05:40:18.434324Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\ndask_df.describe()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-26T05:35:51.807934Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-26T05:35:51.808907Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-26T05:35:53.115664Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-26T05:35:51.808862Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-26T05:35:53.114657Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### loading Test data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\n\nstart = time.time()\ntest_df = dd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/amex-default-prediction/test_data.csv\")\nend = time.time()\nprint(f\"Total time Disk take to read the data is :- {end - start} sec\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-26T05:42:54.928685Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-26T05:42:54.929324Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-26T05:42:54.997451Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-26T05:42:54.929282Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-26T05:42:54.996285Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\ntest_df.head()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-26T05:43:03.75791Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-26T05:43:03.758703Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-26T05:43:05.982373Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-05-26T05:43:03.758663Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-26T05:43:05.98135Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"### NEXT:- I'm going to work on the prediction model stay tuned for that....","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}

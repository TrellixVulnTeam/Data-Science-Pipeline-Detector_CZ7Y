Data points, data features, and data types\n\nThe scikit-learn libary comes with a few small standard datasets. One of the dataset is *Boston house prices dataset*.\n\nIn this dataset, each **data point** describes the situation of a Boston suburb or town. The **input data** includes some **data attributes** related to the place, and the **output data** is the house price (median value of owner-occupied homes in the unit of 1000 USD) at the place.\n\nThe name for each attribute is abbreivated as several capital letters to save space. The following list describes the abbreviations:\n\n- CRIM: per capita crime rate by town\n\n- ZN: proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.\n\n- INDUS: proportion of non-retail business acres per town\n\n- CHAS: Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)\n\n- NOX: nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)\n\n- RM: average number of rooms per dwelling\n\n- AGE: proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940\n\n- DIS: weighted distances to five Boston employment centres\n\n- RAD: index of accessibility to radial highways\n\n- TAX: full-value property-tax rate per $10,000\n\n- PTRATIO: pupil-teacher ratio by town\n\n- B: 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2 where Bk is the proportion of black people by town\n\n- LSTAT: % lower status of the population\n\nYou do not have to understand the specific meanings of each of the attributes.

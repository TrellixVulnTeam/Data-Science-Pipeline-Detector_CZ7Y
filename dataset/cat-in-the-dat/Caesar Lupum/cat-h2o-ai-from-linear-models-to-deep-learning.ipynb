The string ordinal features ord_{3-5} are lexically ordered according to string.ascii_letters.\nSince the purpose of this competition is to explore various encoding strategies, the data has been simplified in that (1) there are no missing values, and (2) the test set does not contain any unseen feature values (See this). (Of course, in real-world settings both of these factors are often important to consider!)\n\n#### Files\n- train.csv - the training set\n- test.csv - the test set; you must make predictions against this data\n- sample_submission.csv - a sample submission file in the correct format"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"> #### Inspired by:\n- https://www.kaggle.com/felipeleiteantunes/h2o-ai-from-linear-models-to-deep-learning (upvote this !)

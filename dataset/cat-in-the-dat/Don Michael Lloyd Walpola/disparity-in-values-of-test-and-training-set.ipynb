This notebook provides a quick assessment of the magnitude of this issue. \n\nThe intuition here is that this problem becomes worse as the proportion of nonoverlaping values increases - if only one row of the test set contains a value that never appears in the training set, that row is not likely going to devastate our analysis, though we might want to drop it. On the other hand, if half the rows of the test set contain values that never appear in the training set, any analysis which tries to ignore this discrepancy is highly dubious."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Initial Loading and Checking"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"","_uuid":"","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# df_sample_submission = pd.read_csv(\"../input/cat-in-the-dat/sample_submission.csv\")\ndf_test = pd.read_csv(\"../input/cat-in-the-dat/test.csv\")\ndf_train = pd.read_csv(\"../input/cat-in-the-dat/train.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_train.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df_test.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"print(\"The training set has {count_train} samples and the test set has {count_test} samples.\".format(count_train=len(df_train), count_test=len(df_test)))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Enumerating Values\n\nFirst, let's do a a quick count of the distinct values in each column of the training set."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"unique_vals = []\nfor col in df_train.columns:\n    unique_vals.append([col, df_train[col].nunique()])\nunique_vals","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"And the same distinct value count for the columns of the test set."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"unique_test_vals = []\nfor col in df_test.columns:\n    unique_test_vals.append([col, df_test[col].nunique()])\nunique_test_vals","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Searching for Discrepancies\n\nSome columns have different numbers of unique values.

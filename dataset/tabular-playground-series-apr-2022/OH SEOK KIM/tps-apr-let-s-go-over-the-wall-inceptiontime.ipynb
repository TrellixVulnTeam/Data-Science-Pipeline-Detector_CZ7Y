The true-positive rate is also known as sensitivity, recall or probability of detection. The false-positive rate is also known as probability of false alarm and can be calculated as (1 − specificity). It can also be thought of as a plot of the power as a function of the Type I Error of the decision rule (when the performance is calculated from just a sample of the population, it can be thought of as estimators of these quantities). The ROC curve is thus the sensitivity or recall as a function of fall-out. \n\nRef: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"-------------------------------------\n# Setting Up","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np \nimport pandas as pd \nfrom fastai.text.all import *\n\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom matplotlib import rcParams\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings(action='ignore')\n\nimport plotly.express as px\nfrom plotly.subplots import make_subplots\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\nsns.set(style=\"ticks\", context=\"talk\")\nplt.style.use(\"dark_background\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-07T14:01:11.889688Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-07T14:01:11.889935Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-07T14:01:22.004018Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-07T14:01:11.889905Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-07T14:01:22.003134Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from tsai.all import *\ncomputer_setup()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-07T14:01:22.005542Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-07T14:01:22.006018Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-07T14:01:24.407279Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-07T14:01:22.005985Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-07T14:01:24.406482Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"train = pd.read_csv('../input/tabular-playground-series-apr-2022/train.csv')\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/tabular-playground-series-apr-2022/test.csv')\nsubmission_df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/tabular-playground-series-apr-2022/sample_submission.csv\")\nlabels_df = pd.read_csv(\"../input/tabular-playground-series-apr-2022/train_labels.csv\")","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-07T14:01:24.408872Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-07T14:01:24.409109Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-07T14:01:35.005834Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-07T14:01:24.40907Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-07T14:01:35.005122Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"----------------------------------------\n# Checking Target Imbalance","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"labels_df.head().T.style.set_properties(**{'background-color': 'black',\n                           'color': 'white',\n                           'border-color': 'white'})","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-07T14:01:35.006912Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-07T14:01:35.007167Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-07T14:01:35.084015Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-07T14:01:35.007138Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-07T14:01:35.082566Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"colors = ['gold', 'mediumturquoise']\nlabels = ['0','1']\nvalues = labels_df['state'].value_counts()/labels_df['state'].shape[0]\n\nfig = go.Figure(data=[go.Pie(labels=labels, values=values, hole=.3)])\nfig.update_traces(hoverinfo='label+percent', textinfo='percent', textfont_size=20,\n                  marker=dict(colors=colors, line=dict(color='#000000', width=2)))\nfig.update_layout(\n    title_text=\"Target Balance\",\n    title_font_color=\"white\",\n    legend_title_font_color=\"yellow\",\n    paper_bgcolor=\"black\",\n    plot_bgcolor='black',\n    font_color=\"white\",\n)\nfig.show()","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-07T14:01:35.085141Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-07T14:01:35.085429Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-07T14:01:35.220478Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-07T14:01:35.085394Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-07T14:01:35.219689Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<span style=\"color:Blue\"> Observation:\n* OK!

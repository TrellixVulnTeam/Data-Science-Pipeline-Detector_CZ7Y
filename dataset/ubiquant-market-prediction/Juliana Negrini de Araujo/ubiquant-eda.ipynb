Overview\nUbiquant Investment (Beijing) Co., Ltd is a leading domestic quantitative hedge fund based in China. Established in 2012, they rely on international talents in math and computer science along with cutting-edge technology to drive quantitative financial market investment. Overall, Ubiquant is committed to creating long-term stable returns for investors.\n\nIn this competition, the goal is to build a time-series model that forecasts an investment's return rate. The dataset contains historical prices to train and test our models.\n\nThe dataset contains 300 features to describe the samples, however, they are all anonymized. Below is a summary of the dataset:\n\n* **time_id** - The ID code for the time the data was gathered. The time IDs are in order, but the real-time between the time IDs is not constant and will likely be shorter for the final private test set than in the training set.\n* **investment_id** - The ID code for an investment. Not all investments have data in all-time IDs.\n* **target** - The target.\n* **f_0 to f_299** - Anonymized features generated from market data.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport gc\nimport numpy as np\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nfrom sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error\nfrom sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-13T18:59:15.502862Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-13T18:59:15.503972Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-13T18:59:16.79694Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-13T18:59:15.503915Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-13T18:59:16.795573Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def basic_EDA(df):\n    size = df.shape\n    sum_null = df.isnull().sum().sum()\n    return print(\"Number of Samples: %d,\\nNumber of Features: %d,\\nNull Entries: %d\" %(size[0],size[1], sum_null))","metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-04-13T18:59:16.798758Z","iopub.execute_input":"2022-04-13T18:59:16.799357Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-04-13T18:59:16.804586Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2022-04-13T18:59:16.799316Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-04-13T18:59:16.803918Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2.

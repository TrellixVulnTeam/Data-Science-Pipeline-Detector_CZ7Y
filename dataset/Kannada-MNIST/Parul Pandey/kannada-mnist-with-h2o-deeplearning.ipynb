The network can contain a large number of hidden layers consisting of neurons with tanh, rectifier, and maxout activation functions.\n\nAdvanced features such as adaptive learning rate, rate annealing, momentum training, dropout, L1 or L2 regularization, checkpointing, and grid search enable high predictive accuracy. Each compute node trains a copy of the global model parameters on its local data with multi-threading (asynchronously) and contributes periodically to the global model via model averaging across the network.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Acknowledgement\n\nArno Candel for his [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/arnocandel/mnist-with-h2o-deeplearning) on MNIST with H2O DeepLearning"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Starting H2O cluster and Importing the DeepLearning Estimator"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import h2o\nprint(h2o.__version__)\nfrom h2o.estimators.deeplearning import H2ODeepLearningEstimator\n\nh2o.init(max_mem_size='16G')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Upload the datasets to the the H2O cluster. \n\nThe data is imported into H2OFrames, which operate similarly in function to pandas DataFrames.

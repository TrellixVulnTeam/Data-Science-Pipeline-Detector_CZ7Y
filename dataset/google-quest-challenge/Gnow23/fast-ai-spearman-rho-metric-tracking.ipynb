Since this is the eventual score we are comparing it against, it only makes sense for us to track it to get a general sense of how we are performing. \n\nSimply add this to your learner similar to the following example:\n\n```\nlearner = Learner(databunch, \n                  custom_transformer_model, \n                  metrics=[SpearmanRho()])\n```\n\nHope this helps!"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from scipy.stats import spearmanr \nfrom fastai.text import *\n\nclass SpearmanRho(Callback):\n    def on_epoch_begin(self, **kwargs):\n        # Reset\n        self.spearman_rho = 0\n        self.spearman_scores = []\n        # Calculate the output scores \n        self.targets = None\n        self.outputs = None\n    def on_batch_end(self, last_output, last_target, **kwargs):\n        if self.targets is None:\n            self.targets = last_target\n        else:\n            self.targets = torch.cat((self.targets, last_target))\n        if self.outputs is None:\n            self.outputs = last_output\n        else:\n            self.outputs = torch.cat((self.outputs, last_output))\n    \n    def on_epoch_end(self, last_output, last_target, last_metrics, **kwargs):\n        for i in range(self.outputs.shape[1]):\n            # Calculate spearman score across the differerent metrics\n            spearman_score =\\\n            spearmanr(self.outputs.permute(1, 0)[i], \n                      self.targets.permute(1, 0)[i])\n            self.spearman_scores.append(spearman_score[0]) \n        self.spearman_rho = np.nanmean(self.spearman_scores)\n        nan_count = sum([np.isnan(x) for x in self.spearman_scores])/len(self.spearman_scores)\n        if nan_count > 0:\n            print(\"The number of nan in the spearman scores is: \"+str(nan_count))\n        return add_metrics(last_metrics, self.spearman_rho)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

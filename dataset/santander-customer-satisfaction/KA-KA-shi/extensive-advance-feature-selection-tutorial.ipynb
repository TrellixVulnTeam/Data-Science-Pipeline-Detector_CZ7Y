In the second step, it evaluates all possible combinations of the selected feature and a second feature, and selects the pair that produce the best performing algorithm based on the same pre-set criteria.\n\nThe pre-set criteria can be the roc_auc for classification and the r squared for regression for example. \n\nThis selection procedure is called greedy, because it evaluates all possible single, double, triple and so on feature combinations. Therefore, it is quite computationally expensive, and sometimes, if feature space is big, even unfeasible.\n\nThere is a special package for python that implements this type of feature selection: mlxtend.\n\nIn the mlxtend implementation of the step forward feature selection, the stopping criteria is an arbitrarily set number of features.

For example, if the classifier is a logistic regression and the dataset consists of 4 features, the algorithm will evaluate all **15** feature combinations as follows:\n\n- all possible combinations of 1 feature\n- all possible combinations of 2 features\n- all possible combinations of 3 features\n- all the 4 features\n\nand select the one that results in the best performance (e.g., classification accuracy) of the logistic regression classifier.\n\nThis is another greedy algorithm as it evaluates all possible feature combinations. It is quite computationally expensive, and sometimes, if feature space is big, even unfeasible.\n\nThere is a special package for python that implements this type of feature selection: mlxtend.\n\nIn the mlxtend implementation of the exhaustive feature selection, the stopping criteria is an arbitrarily set number of features. So the search will finish when we reach the desired number of selected features. \n\nThis is somewhat arbitrary because we may be selecting a subopimal number of features, or likewise, a high number of features. \n\nHere I will use the Exhaustive feature selection algorithm from mlxtend in a classification (Paribas).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor, RandomForestClassifier\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\n\nfrom mlxtend.feature_selection import ExhaustiveFeatureSelector as EFS","metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2019-06-17T17:44:39.562662Z","start_time":"2019-06-17T17:44:39.553662Z"},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-19T10:41:31.949278Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-19T10:41:31.949782Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-19T10:41:31.96103Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-19T10:41:31.949707Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-19T10:41:31.960083Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# load dataset\ndata = pd.read_csv('../input/santander-customer-satisfaction/train.csv', nrows=50000)\ndata.shape","metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2019-06-17T17:44:41.179965Z","start_time":"2019-06-17T17:44:40.134966Z"},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-19T10:42:33.207393Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-19T10:42:33.207828Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-19T10:42:34.654479Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-19T10:42:33.207791Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-19T10:42:34.652693Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data.head()","metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2019-06-17T17:44:41.755333Z","start_time":"2019-06-17T17:44:41.726338Z"},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-19T10:42:34.657369Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-19T10:42:34.657892Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-19T10:42:34.698354Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-19T10:42:34.657836Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-19T10:42:34.696877Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# In practice, feature selection should be done after data pre-processing,\n# so ideally, all the categorical variables are encoded into numbers,\n# and then you can assess how deterministic they are of the target\n\n# here for simplicity I will use only numerical variables\n# select numerical columns:\n\nnumerics = ['int16', 'int32', 'int64', 'float16', 'float32', 'float64']\nnumerical_vars = list(data.select_dtypes(include=numerics).columns)\ndata = data[numerical_vars]\ndata.shape","metadata":{"ExecuteTime":{"end_time":"2019-06-17T17:44:44.440742Z","start_time":"2019-06-17T17:44:44.354744Z"},"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-06-19T10:42:35.125291Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-06-19T10:42:35.1257Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-06-19T10:42:35.29957Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-06-19T10:42:35.125667Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-06-19T10:42:35.298234Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Important\n\nIn all feature selection procedures, it is good practice to select the features by examining only the training set.

7.Recursive feature selection using random forests importance\n\nRandom Forests assign equal or similar importance to features that are highly correlated. In addition, when features are correlated, the importance assigned is lower than the importance attributed to the feature itself, should the tree be built without the correlated counterparts.\n\nTherefore, instead of eliminating features based  on importance by brute force , we may get a better selection by removing one feature at a time, and recalculating the importance on each round.\n\nThis method is an hybrid between embedded and wrapper methods: it is based on computation derived when fitting the model, but it also requires fitting several models.\n\nThe cycle is as follows:\n\n- Build random forests using all features\n- Remove least important feature\n- Build random forests and recalculate importance\n- Repeat until a criteria is met\n\nIn this situation, when a feature that is highly correlated to another one is removed, then, the importance of the remaining feature increases. This may lead to a better subset feature space selection. On the downside, building several random forests is quite time consuming, in particular if the dataset contains a high number of features.\n\nI will demonstrate how to select features based random forests importance recursively using sklearn on classification problem.

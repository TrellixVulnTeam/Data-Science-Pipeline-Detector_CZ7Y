# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory



# We'll also import seaborn, a Python graphing library
import warnings # current version of seaborn generates a bunch of warnings that we'll ignore
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
import seaborn as sns

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
sns.set(style="white", color_codes=True)

# Next, we'll load the train and test dataset, which is in the "../input/" directory
train = pd.read_csv("../input/train.csv") # the train dataset is now a Pandas DataFrame
test = pd.read_csv("../input/test.csv") # the train dataset is now a Pandas DataFrame

# Let's see what's in the trainings data - Jupyter notebooks print the result of the last thing you do
train.head()

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

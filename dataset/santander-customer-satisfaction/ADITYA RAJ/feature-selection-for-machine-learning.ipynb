In other words, the same value for all the rows of the dataset. These features provide no information that allows a machine learning model to discriminate or predict a target.\n\nIdentifying and removing constant features is an easy first step towards feature selection and more easily interpretable machine learning models.\n\nHere, I will demonstrate how to identify constant features using a dataset.\n\nTo identify constant features, we can use the VarianceThreshold from Scikit-learn, or we can code it ourselves. If using the VarianceThreshold, all our variables need to be numerical. If we do it manually however, we can apply the code to both numerical and categorical variables.\n\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import VarianceThreshold","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"data = pd.read_csv('../input/santander-customer-satisfaction/train.csv')\ndata.shape","metadata":{"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Note: \nIn all feature selection procedures, it is good practice to select the features by examining only the training set.

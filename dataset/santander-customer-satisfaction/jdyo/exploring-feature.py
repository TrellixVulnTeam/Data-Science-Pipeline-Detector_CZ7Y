# Based on https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/d/uciml/iris/python-data-visualizations/notebook
# First, we'll import pandas, a data processing and CSV file I/O library
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# We'll also import seaborn, a Python graphing library
import warnings # current version of seaborn generates a bunch of warnings that we'll ignore
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore")
import seaborn as sns

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
sns.set(style="white", color_codes=True)

# Next, we'll load the train and test dataset, which is in the "../input/" directory
train = pd.read_csv("../input/train.csv") # the train dataset is now a Pandas DataFrame
test = pd.read_csv("../input/test.csv") # the train dataset is now a Pandas DataFrame

# Let's see what's in the trainings data - Jupyter notebooks print the result of the last thing you do
train.head()

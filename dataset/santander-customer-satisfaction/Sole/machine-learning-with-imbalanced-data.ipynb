These are in essence redundant or non-predictive. Next, I will find quasi-constant features, and evaluate the distribution of its values across satisfied and un-satisfied customers, to determine if I can remove them.\n\n* Remove constant features\n* Remove duplicated features\n\n\n## The Machine Learning Model\n\nThis is a classification problem. I want to predict if a customer is unsatisfied (1 in the target). From the off-the-shelf algorithms we know that **Gradient Boosting Machines** out-perform all other models. So in this notebook I will train a Gradient Boosting Classifier from Scikit-learn.\n\n\n## Imbalanced data\n\nThere are a number of techniques that we can use to try and improve the performance of models trained on imbalanced datasets. We can under- or over-sample the dataset. Within the under-sampling techniques we have cleaning techniques that allow us to remove noisy observations instead of observations just at random. Within the over-sampling techniques we have methods to create new, \"synthetic\", data using existing observations as templates. This way, we do not just \"duplicate\" the data as we would do with over-sampling.\n\nWe can also implement cost-sensitive learning, where we modify the optimization function to account for the cost of miss-classification. Miss-classifying an observation from the minority class tends to be more costly in real situations. And finally we have special ensemble algorithms that were designed specifically to work with imbalanced datasets.\n\nSo in summary, we could try:\n\n* undersampling at random or based on cleaning criteria\n* oversampling at random or create synthethic new data\n* introduce cost sensitive learning\n* train a special algorithm for imbalanced datasets\n\nFor more details on feature engineering and feature selection, hyperparameter optimization or working with imbalanced datasets, visit my [online courses](https://www.trainindata.com/).","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Let's install Feature-engine\n# this package will allow us to quickly remove \n# non-predictive variables\n\n!pip install feature-engine","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-14T15:54:39.970384Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-14T15:54:39.97089Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-14T15:54:49.457958Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-14T15:54:39.97077Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-14T15:54:49.456576Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# I use GBM because it usually out-performs other off-the-shelf \n# classifiers\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier\n\n# metric to optimize for the competition\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n\n# to assemble various procedures in sequence\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n\n# some methods to work with imbalanced data are based in nearest neighbours\n# and nearest neighbours are sensitive to the magnitude of the features\n# so we need to scale the data\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\n\n# import selection classes from Feature-engine\n# to reduce the number of features\nfrom feature_engine.selection import (\n    DropDuplicateFeatures,\n    DropConstantFeatures,\n)\n\n# over-sampling techniques for imbalanced data\nfrom imblearn.over_sampling import (\n    RandomOverSampler,\n    SMOTENC,\n)\n\n# under-sampling techniques for imbalanced data\nfrom imblearn.under_sampling import (\n    InstanceHardnessThreshold,\n    RandomUnderSampler,\n)\n\n# special ensemble methods to work with imbalanced data\n# we will use those based on boosting, which tend to work better\nfrom imblearn.ensemble import (\n    RUSBoostClassifier,\n    EasyEnsembleClassifier,\n)","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-14T15:54:49.459997Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-14T15:54:49.460247Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-14T15:54:50.785629Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-14T15:54:49.460216Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-14T15:54:50.784806Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Load Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# load the Santander Customer Satisfaction dataset\n\ndata = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/santander-customer-satisfaction/train.csv')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-14T15:54:50.7869Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-14T15:54:50.788156Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-14T15:54:53.852248Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-14T15:54:50.788109Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-14T15:54:53.851112Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# separate dataset into train and test sets\n# I split 20:80 mostly to reduce the size of the train set\n# so that this notebook does not run out of memory :_(\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(\n    data.drop(labels=['ID','TARGET'], axis=1),\n    data['TARGET'],\n    test_size=0.8,\n    random_state=0)\n\nX_train.shape, X_test.shape","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-14T15:54:53.853933Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-14T15:54:53.854772Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-14T15:54:54.243071Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-14T15:54:53.85473Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-14T15:54:54.242484Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Target\n\nThe target class is imbalanced.

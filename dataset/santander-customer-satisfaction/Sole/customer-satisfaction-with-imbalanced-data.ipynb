Otherwise, the kernel runs out of memory and breaks. So I will do that here, to be able to show methods for hyperparameter optimization and techniques used on imbalanced datasets. But if I was working on a computer with more computational resources, I would probably not reduce the number of features before hand. In fact, I would evaluate how predictve the features are at the back of the techniques applied to work with imbalaced data. And this is because some methods will alter the distribution of the data, thus, features that were not originally predictive, could be so after resampling.\n\nIn any case, I will take the opportunity to discuss the feature selection methods that I use and why.\n\n## In this notebook\n\n* Remove non-predictive features\n* Train a classifier to predict customer satisfaction\n* Optimize hyperparameters\n* Improve performance with different techniques for imbalanced data\n\n## Feature selection\n\nTo begin with, I will remove duplicated and constant features. These are in essence redundant or non-predictive. Next, I will find quasi-constant features, and evaluate the distribution of its values across satisfied and un-satisfied customers, to determine if I can remove them.\n\n* Remove constant features\n* Remove duplicated features\n* Remove quasi-constant features\n\nMore details throughout the notebook.\n\n## The Machine Learning Model\n\nThis is a classification problem. I want to predict if a customer is unsatisfied (1 in the target). From the off-the-shelf algorithms we know that **Gradient Boosting Machines** out-perform all other models. So in this notebook I will train a Gradient Boosting Classifier from Scikit-learn.\n\nOther suitable options would be a Gradient Boosting Classifier from the packages **xgb** or **LightGBM**. In fact, if you have computing power, you could try both along side the GBM from sklearn. Or simply pick the one you like the most, to keep things simple.\n\n## Hyperparameter Optimization\n\nThere are a number of methods to select the best hyperparameters. The basic methods include grid seearch and random search. Those are usually suitable for models with few hyperparameters, like the GBM from sklearn. If we had a lot of hyperparameters and a model that is very costly to train, then we would be better of performing bayesian hyperparameter optimization. But for this problem, that might be an over-kill and a random search should be more than enough.\n\nThe number of hyperparameters in Gradient Boosting Machines is not very big, so we should be able to find the best hyperparameters with a Randomized Search. So in this notebook, I will use this procedure. Randomized Search comes baked into sklearn, so there is no need to use alternative Python packages.\n\n* Randomized hyperparameter search with sklearn\n\n## Imbalanced data\n\nThere are a number of techniques that we can use to try and improve the performance of models trained on imbalanced datasets. We can under- or over-sample the dataset. Within the under-sampling techniques we have cleaning techniques that allow us to remove noisy observations instead of observations just at random. Within the over-sampling techniques we have methods to create new, \"synthetic\", data using existing observations as templates. This way, we do not just \"duplicate\" the data as we would do with over-sampling.\n\nWe can also implement cost-sensitive learning, where we modify the optimization function to account for the cost of miss-classification. Miss-classifying an observation from the minority class tends to be more costly in real situations. And finally we have special ensemble algorithms that were designed specifically to work with imbalanced datasets.\n\nSo in summary, we could try:\n\n* undersampling at random or based on cleaning criteria\n* oversampling at random or create synthethic new data\n* introduce cost sensitive learning\n* train a special algorithm for imbalanced datasets\n\nFor more details on feature selection, hyperparameter optimization or working with imbalanced datasets, visit my [online courses](https://www.trainindata.com/)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Let's install Feature-engine\n# this package will allow us to quickly remove \n# non-predictive variables\n\n!pip install feature-engine","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-14T14:42:54.430873Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-14T14:42:54.43131Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-14T14:43:00.252908Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-14T14:42:54.431253Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-14T14:43:00.251486Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# to sample the hyperparameter space based on distributions\nfrom scipy import stats\n\n# I use GBM because it usually out-performs other off-the-shelf \n# classifiers\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier\n\n# to evaluate features\nfrom sklearn.feature_selection import chi2\n\n# metric to optimize for the competition\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\n\n# to optimize the hyperparameters we import the randomized search class\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import (\n    RandomizedSearchCV,\n    train_test_split,\n)\n\n# to assemble various procedures in sequence\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n\n# some methods to work with imbalanced data are based in nearest neighbours\n# and nearest neighbours are sensitive to the magnitude of the features\n# so we need to scale the data\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import (\n    MinMaxScaler,\n    Binarizer,\n)\n\n# import selection classes from Feature-engine\n# to reduce the number of features\nfrom feature_engine.selection import (\n    DropDuplicateFeatures,\n    DropConstantFeatures,\n)\n\n# to apply sklearn transformers to a subset of features\nfrom feature_engine.wrappers import SklearnTransformerWrapper\n\n# over-sampling techniques for imbalanced data\nfrom imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTENC\n\n# under-sampling techniques for imbalanced data\nfrom imblearn.under_sampling import (\n    InstanceHardnessThreshold,\n)\n\n# special ensemble methods to work with imbalanced data\n# we will use those based on boosting, which tend to work better\nfrom imblearn.ensemble import (\n    RUSBoostClassifier,\n    EasyEnsembleClassifier,\n)\n\n# to put the final model together at the end of the notebook\nfrom imblearn.pipeline import Pipeline as imb_Pipeline","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-14T14:43:00.259367Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-14T14:43:00.259828Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-14T14:43:00.879292Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-14T14:43:00.25978Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-14T14:43:00.876887Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Load Data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# load the Santander Customer Satisfaction dataset\n\ndata = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/santander-customer-satisfaction/train.csv')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-14T14:43:00.881173Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-14T14:43:00.881591Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-14T14:43:05.549422Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-14T14:43:00.881539Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-14T14:43:05.54839Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# separate dataset into train and test sets\n# I split 20:80 mostly to reduce the size of the train set\n# so that this notebook does not run out of memory :_(\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(\n    data.drop(labels=['ID','TARGET'], axis=1),\n    data['TARGET'],\n    test_size=0.8,\n    random_state=0)\n\nX_train.shape, X_test.shape","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-14T14:43:05.633305Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-14T14:43:05.633751Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-14T14:43:05.949132Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-14T14:43:05.633702Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-14T14:43:05.948115Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Target\n\nThe target class is imbalanced.

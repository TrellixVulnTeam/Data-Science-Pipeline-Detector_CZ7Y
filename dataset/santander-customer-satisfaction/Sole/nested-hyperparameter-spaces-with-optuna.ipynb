I applied each technique separately, searching for the best hyperparameters in each case, using randomized search.\n\n**But what if, the technique to improve model performance was in itself another hyperparameter?**\n\n**What if we could write code, that automatically was able to find which technique would work best in our data?**\n\nThis is what we are going to do in this notebooks. We will write code where each technique is an additional hyperparameter that we can optimize. And because now training the models turns more computationally costly and we have more hyperparameters, instead of Randomized search we will performe Bayesian optimization of the hyperparameters, a method that guides the search towards more promising values of the hyperparameters.\n\nWe will use Optuna for the optimization, because it allows us to define hyperparameters on the fly, with its \"define-by-run\" API design.\n\nSo, let's get started!\n\nPS: If you want to know more about hyperparameter optimization or working with imbalanced datasets, feel free to check my [online courses](https://www.trainindata.com/).\n","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Let's install Feature-engine\n# this package will allow us to quickly remove \n# non-predictive variables\n\n!pip install feature-engine","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-15T14:55:53.768389Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-15T14:55:53.769121Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-15T14:56:04.650696Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-15T14:55:53.768998Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-15T14:56:04.649822Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# to sample the hyperparameter space based on distributions\nfrom scipy import stats\n\n# I use GBM because it usually out-performs other off-the-shelf \n# classifiers\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import GradientBoostingClassifier\n\n# metric to optimize for the competition\nfrom sklearn.metrics import roc_auc_score\n\n# to optimize the hyperparameters we import the randomized search class\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import (\n    cross_val_score,\n    train_test_split,\n)\n\n# to assemble various procedures in sequence\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\n\n# some methods to work with imbalanced data are based in nearest neighbours\n# and nearest neighbours are sensitive to the magnitude of the features\n# so we need to scale the data\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler\n\n# import selection classes from Feature-engine\n# to reduce the number of features\nfrom feature_engine.selection import (\n    DropDuplicateFeatures,\n    DropConstantFeatures,\n)\n\n\n# over-sampling techniques for imbalanced data\nfrom imblearn.over_sampling import (\n    RandomOverSampler,\n    SMOTENC,\n)\n\n# under-sampling techniques for imbalanced data\nfrom imblearn.under_sampling import (\n    RandomUnderSampler,\n    InstanceHardnessThreshold,\n)\n\n# special ensemble methods to work with imbalanced data\n# we will use those based on boosting, which tend to work better\nfrom imblearn.ensemble import (\n    RUSBoostClassifier,\n    EasyEnsembleClassifier,\n)\n\n# to put the undersampling methods and the GBM together\nfrom imblearn.pipeline import make_pipeline\n\nimport optuna","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-15T15:40:55.32548Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-15T15:40:55.325782Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-15T15:40:55.33384Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-15T15:40:55.325736Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-15T15:40:55.333188Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Load the data","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# load the Santander Customer Satisfaction dataset\n\ndata = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/santander-customer-satisfaction/train.csv')","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-15T14:58:34.86464Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-15T14:58:34.864917Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-15T14:58:37.906181Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-15T14:58:34.864889Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-15T14:58:37.905271Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# separate dataset into train and test sets\n# I split 30:70 mostly to reduce the size of the train set\n# so that this notebook does not run out of memory :_(\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(\n    data.drop(labels=['ID','TARGET'], axis=1),\n    data['TARGET'],\n    test_size=0.7,\n    random_state=0)\n\nX_train.shape, X_test.shape","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-10-15T14:59:08.588662Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-10-15T14:59:08.588981Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-10-15T14:59:08.916008Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-10-15T14:59:08.588946Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-10-15T14:59:08.915093Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Target\n\nThe target class is imbalanced.

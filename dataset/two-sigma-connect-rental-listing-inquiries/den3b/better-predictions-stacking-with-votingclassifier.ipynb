If you are interested in this topic, then I suggest you to have a look at [this][1] and [this][2] to start. \n\nHere I will show a simple technique that is known as \"Soft Voting\" and can be implemented with Sklearn VotingClassifier.\n\n\n  [1]: http://blog.kaggle.com/2016/12/27/a-kagglers-guide-to-model-stacking-in-practice/\n  [2]: http://mlwave.com/kaggle-ensembling-guide/"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"e890c747-9f28-35db-651f-f286beb28bd8"},"outputs":[],"source":"# import what we need\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import log_loss\n\nfrom sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, VotingClassifier \nfrom xgboost import XGBClassifier"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"1cd3faef-f4b7-308e-9b25-d260d3e353de"},"source":"First, let's read the data and perform the feature engineering for numerical features of [Li Li's notebook][1].\n\n\n  [1]: https://www.kaggle.com/aikinogard/two-sigma-connect-rental-listing-inquiries/random-forest-starter-with-numerical-features"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"bfdba8ca-0cdc-8a03-a56b-fd8c22aca3d1"},"outputs":[],"source":"df = pd.read_json(open(\"../input/train.json\", \"r\"))"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"e08d7222-3fac-1e8f-33a8-097d929fcc95"},"outputs":[],"source":"df[\"num_photos\"] = df[\"photos\"].apply(len)\ndf[\"num_features\"] = df[\"features\"].apply(len)\ndf[\"num_description_words\"] = df[\"description\"].apply(lambda x: len(x.split(\" \")))\ndf[\"created\"] = pd.to_datetime(df[\"created\"])\ndf[\"created_year\"] = df[\"created\"].dt.year\ndf[\"created_month\"] = df[\"created\"].dt.month\ndf[\"created_day\"] = df[\"created\"].dt.day"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"e76a6ec0-6466-1159-0d0d-633d35238b45"},"outputs":[],"source":"num_feats = [\"bathrooms\", \"bedrooms\", \"latitude\", \"longitude\", \"price\",\n             \"num_photos\", \"num_features\", \"num_description_words\",\n             \"created_year\", \"created_month\", \"created_day\"]\nX = df[num_feats]\ny = df[\"interest_level\"]\nX.head()"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"1cd76452-e725-fc59-5391-43c937057a46"},"source":"Let's split the training data in two for validation"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"a1404a66-3e46-e5f9-7757-d05104cc6bfd"},"outputs":[],"source":"# random state for reproducing same results\nrandom_state = 54321\n\nX_train, X_val, y_train, y_val = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.33, random_state = 54321)"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"a0c61367-ec09-c9bf-e216-6806a6531e0d"},"source":"For this little experiment we will combine the predictions of 4 different classifiers, trained with basic parametrization.

Sometimes variables are squared or transformed as part of feature engineering because it can help linear models learn relationships that are non-linear. However, since we will be using more complex models, these squared features are redundant. They are highly correlated with the non-squared version, and hence can actually hurt our model by adding irrelevant information and also slowing down training.\n\nFor an example, let's take a look at SQBage vs age.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"sns.lmplot('age', 'SQBage', data = data, fit_reg = False);\nplt.title('squared age versus age');","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-14T09:28:24.689969Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-14T09:28:24.690394Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-14T09:28:25.073939Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-14T09:28:24.690356Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-14T09:28:25.073017Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# remove squared variables\ndata = data.drop(columns = sqr_)\ndata.shape","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-14T09:28:25.075182Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-14T09:28:25.075476Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-14T09:28:25.09683Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-14T09:28:25.075448Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-14T09:28:25.095697Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Id Variables\nThese are pretty simple: they will be kept as is in the data since we need them for identification.\n\n### Household Level Variables\nFirst let's subset to the heads of household and then to the household level variables.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"heads = data.loc[data['parentesco1'] == 1, :]\nheads = heads[id_ + hh_bool + hh_cont + hh_ordered]\nheads.shape","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2021-09-14T09:28:25.099969Z","iopub.execute_input":"2021-09-14T09:28:25.100294Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-09-14T09:28:25.121241Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-09-14T09:28:25.100262Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-09-14T09:28:25.120325Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"For most of the household level variables, we can simply keep them as is: since we want to make predictions for each household, we use these variables as features.

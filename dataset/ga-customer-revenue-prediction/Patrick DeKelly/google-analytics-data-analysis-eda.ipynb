Hopefully, the outcome will be more actionable operational changes and a better use of marketing budgets for those companies who choose to use data analysis on top of GA data.*\n\nThis is exploritory data analysis for the Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction Competion on Kaggle. The competition ended on November 30th 2018 and the results are evaluated on future data compiled between December 1st 2018 to January 31st 2019."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import warnings\nwarnings.simplefilter(action='ignore', category=FutureWarning)\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom pandas.io.json import json_normalize\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nimport json\nimport os\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\nfrom plotly import tools\nfrom plotly.offline import init_notebook_mode, iplot, plot\nimport plotly.offline as py\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","collapsed":true,"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":false},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# About in the Data\n\n### Data Fields\n\n**fullVisitorId** - A unique identifier for each user of the Google Merchandise Store.\n\n**channelGrouping** - The channel via which the user came to the Store.\n\n**date** - The date on which the user visited the Store.\n\n**device** - The specifications for the device used to access the Store. (JSON format)\n\n**geoNetwork** - This section contains information about the geography of the user. (JSON format)\n\n**socialEngagementType** - Engagement type, either \"Socially Engaged\" or \"Not Socially Engaged\".\n\n**totals** - This section contains aggregate values across the session. (JSON format)\n\n**trafficSource** - This section contains information about the Traffic Source from which the session originated. (JSON format)\n\n**visitId** - An identifier for this session. This is part of the value usually stored as the _utmb cookie. This is only unique to the user. For a completely unique ID, you should use a combination of fullVisitorId and visitId.\n\n**visitNumber** - The session number for this user. If this is the first session, then this is set to 1.\n\n**visitStartTime** - The timestamp (expressed as POSIX time).\n\n**hits** - This row and nested fields are populated for any and all types of hits. Provides a record of all page visits.\n\n**customDimensions** - This section contains any user-level or session-level custom dimensions that are set for a session. This is a repeated field and has an entry for each dimension that is set.\n\n**totals** - This set of columns mostly includes high-level aggregate data.\n\n\n### Timeframe\n\nThe training data we are using is from August 2016 to May 2018.\n\n### Size and Format\n\nThe version 2 of the training data is fairly large at ~1.7 million rows. While in a csv file, many of the columns are in JSON format. \n\n# Read in the Data\n\nThe 1.7 million rows will need to be read in chunks of 100K to not overload memory. **customDimensions** and **hits** columns are extremely large and don't help much in an EDA so they are dropped to save space.  The JSON format columns need to also be processed into additional columns.

This is likely because the vast majority of visits and purchases are from america and the more active hours for the site are during the afternoon-night in america.\n\n- While both lines follow the same trend, the visits with purchase line is much more pronounced. Noting again that these lines follow american time zones, we can also infer that while people might still visit the site different hours of the day, few people seem less inclined to make purchases during late night/early morning hours and are more likely to actually pull out their credit cards and make a purchase in the evening.\n"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"6bd2a6b1ddc0f962040777d992a32be27569fca6"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Date: Exploration"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"6a7a01ee5f26b7dec93018f9df04be9205ef6b78","_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"create_timeplot(\"date\",\"Visits by Date\",\"Date\", \"% of Visits\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"33ba5c6ce79a4901785d7a4445b06de103a153c0"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Date: What We Learned\n\n- The data has very clear regular waves for both Visits and Visits with Purchase.

This is likely because they are so strongly correlated with each other and only have slightly different meanings.\n\n- Purchase visits max around 15-20 page view/hits and follow a right-skewed distribution.\n\n- While the means revenue graphs have some spikes throughout the charts, the low confidence rates and scattered occurrences suggest that this is likely just from small subsample sizes. \n\n- That being said, there might still be some evidence that single page/hit visitors make larger purchases, on the rare chance that they do, since both means graphs show rather large spikes at 1 visit hits. This *might* be true because they might have been following direct links to the site and already had their purchase in mind with no interest in browsing.\n"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}

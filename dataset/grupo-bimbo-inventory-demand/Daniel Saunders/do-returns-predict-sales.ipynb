I'm still grappling with understanding the nuances of the dataset, but one question I was interested in was whether returns predict future sales. For example, if there are a lot of returns for a product by a client, will there be less sales for it in the future? If so, then we could use returns - as opposed to just demand - in our model to help forecast future demand.\n\nI decided to inspect a random sample of the histories of some products with some clients in the dataset, watching how the sales and returns changed from week 3 to week 7. Could I see any obvious relationship between returns and future sales?

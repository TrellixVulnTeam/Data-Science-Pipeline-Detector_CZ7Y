It helps to train, manipulate, and visualize.\n\nEvery machine learning pipeline is a Directed acyclic graph. [MLComp](https://github.com/catalyst-team/mlcomp) helps to execute it in a parallel manner, see the results via Web UI and manipulate the process easily.\n\nhttps://github.com/catalyst-team/mlcomp\n\n[Catalyst](https://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst) helps to train neural networks. It helps to get good positions in the competitions.\n\nFor an example, [yu4u and the others have finished at the 4th place using Catalyst](https://www.kaggle.com/c/recursion-cellular-image-classification/discussion/110337#latest-635296)\n\nhttps://github.com/catalyst-team/catalyst"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Install MLComp library.

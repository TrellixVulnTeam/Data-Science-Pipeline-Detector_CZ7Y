It appears as a mucoid lactose fermenter on MacConkey agar.\n\n![Bacteroides fragilis](https://i.ibb.co/vx37m7N/Bacteroides-Fragilis-Gram.jpg)\n\nAlthough found in the normal flora of the mouth, skin, and intestines, it can cause destructive changes to human and animal lungs if aspirated, specifically to the alveoli resulting in bloody, brownish or yellow colored jelly like sputum. In the clinical setting, it is the most significant member of the genus Klebsiella of the Enterobacteriaceae. K. oxytoca and K. rhinoscleromatis have also been demonstrated in human clinical specimens. In recent years, Klebsiella species have become important pathogens in nosocomial infections.\n\n\n**Streptococcus pyogenes** - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pyogenes\nStreptococcus pyogenes is a species of Gram-positive, aerotolerant bacteria in the genus Streptococcus. These bacteria are extracellular, and made up of non-motile and non-sporing cocci (round cells) that tend to link in chains. They are clinically important for humans, as they are an infrequent, but usually pathogenic, part of the skin microbiota that can cause Group A streptococcal infection. S. pyogenes is the predominant species harboring the Lancefield group A antigen, and is often called group A Streptococcus (GAS). However, both Streptococcus dysgalactiae and the Streptococcus anginosus group can possess group A antigen as well. Group A streptococci, when grown on blood agar, typically produce small (2–3 mm) zones of beta-hemolysis, a complete destruction of red blood cells. The name group A (beta-hemolytic) Streptococcus (GABHS) is thus also used.\n\n![Streptococcus pyogenes](https://i.ibb.co/GRhzXHd/Streptococcus-pyogenes.jpg)\n\nThe species name is derived from Greek words meaning 'a chain' (streptos) of berries (coccus [Latinized from kokkos]) and pus (pyo)-forming (genes), since a number of infections caused by the bacterium produce pus. The main criterion for differentiation between Staphylococcus spp. and Streptococcus spp. is the catalase test. Staphylococci are catalase positive whereas streptococci are catalase-negative. S. pyogenes can be cultured on fresh blood agar plates. Under ideal conditions, it has an incubation period of 1 to 3 days.\n\nAn estimated 700 million GAS infections occur worldwide each year. While the overall mortality rate for these infections is 0.1%, over 650,000 of the cases are severe and invasive, with these cases having a mortality rate of 25%. Early recognition and treatment are critical; diagnostic failure can result in sepsis and death.\n\n\n**Streptococcus pneumoniae** - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streptococcus_pneumoniae\nStreptococcus pneumoniae, or pneumococcus, is a Gram-positive, spherical bacteria, alpha-hemolytic (under aerobic conditions) or beta-hemolytic (under anaerobic conditions), aerotolerant anaerobic member of the genus Streptococcus. They are usually found in pairs (diplococci) and do not form spores and are non motile.As a significant human pathogenic bacterium S. pneumoniae was recognized as a major cause of pneumonia in the late 19th century, and is the subject of many humoral immunity studies.\n\n![Streptococcus ](https://i.ibb.co/zPKBrJB/Pneumococcus-CDC-PHIL-ID1003.jpg)\n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae resides asymptomatically in healthy carriers typically colonizing the respiratory tract, sinuses, and nasal cavity. However, in susceptible individuals with weaker immune systems, such as the elderly and young children, the bacterium may become pathogenic and spread to other locations to cause disease. It spreads by direct person-to-person contact via respiratory droplets and by auto inoculation in persons carrying the bacteria in their upper respiratory tracts.[3] It can be a cause of neonatal infections.\n\n**Campylobacter jejuni** - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Campylobacter_jejuni\nCampylobacter jejuni (/ˈkæmpɪloʊˌbæktər dʒəˈdʒuːni/) is one of the most common causes of food poisoning in Europe and in the United States. The vast majority of cases occur as isolated events, not as part of recognized outbreaks. Active surveillance through the Foodborne Diseases Active Surveillance Network (FoodNet) indicates that about 20 cases are diagnosed each year for each 100,000 people in the US, while many more cases are undiagnosed or unreported; the CDC estimates a total of 1.5 million infections every year. The European Food Safety Authority reported 246,571 cases in 2018, and estimated approximately nine million cases of human campylobacteriosis per year in the European Union.\n\n![Campylobacter jejuni](https://i.ibb.co/7KDgWym/ARS-Campylobacter-jejuni.jpg)\n\nCampylobacter jejuni is in a genus of bacteria that is among the most common causes of bacterial infections in humans worldwide. Campylobacter means \"curved rod\", deriving from the Greek kampylos (curved) and baktron (rod). Of its many species, C. jejuni is considered one of the most important from both a microbiological and public health perspective.\n\n**Salmonella enterica** - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonella_enterica\nSalmonella enterica (formerly Salmonella choleraesuis) is a rod-headed, flagellate, facultative anaerobic, Gram-negative bacterium and a species of the genus Salmonella. A number of its serovars are serious human pathogens.\n\n![Salmonella ](https://i.ibb.co/xMbfx62/1280px-Salmonella-enterica-serovar-typhimurium-01.jpg)\n\n**Escherichia coli** - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_coli\nEscherichia coli (/ˌɛʃəˈrɪkiə ˈkoʊlaɪ/), also known as E. coli (/ˌiː ˈkoʊlaɪ/), is a Gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, rod-shaped, coliform bacterium of the genus Escherichia that is commonly found in the lower intestine of warm-blooded organisms. Most E. coli strains are harmless, but some serotypes (EPEC, ETEC etc.) can cause serious food poisoning in their hosts, and are occasionally responsible for food contamination incidents that prompt product recalls.The harmless strains are part of the normal microbiota of the gut, and can benefit their hosts by producing vitamin K2, and preventing colonisation of the intestine with pathogenic bacteria, having a mutualistic relationship. E. coli is expelled into the environment within fecal matter. The bacterium grows massively in fresh fecal matter under aerobic conditions for 3 days, but its numbers decline slowly afterwards.\n![Escherichia ](https://i.ibb.co/XzM8NrX/1280px-E-coli-at-10000x-original.jpg)\n\n**Enterococcus_hirae** - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterococcus\nEnterococcus is a large genus of lactic acid bacteria of the phylum Firmicutes. Enterococci are gram-positive cocci that often occur in pairs (diplococci) or short chains, and are difficult to distinguish from streptococci on physical characteristics alone. Two species are common commensal organisms in the intestines of humans: E. faecalis (90–95%) and E. faecium (5–10%). Rare clusters of infections occur with other species, including E. casseliflavus, E. gallinarum, and E. raffinosus.\n\n![Enterococcus_hirae](https://i.ibb.co/Dzs7FvB/Enterococcus-histological-pneumonia-01.png)\n\n**Escherichia fergusonii** - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escherichia_fergusonii\nEscherichia fergusonii is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped species of bacterium. Closely related to the well-known species Escherichia coli, E. fergusonii was first isolated from samples of human blood. The species is named for American microbiologist William W. Ferguson.\nSome strains of E. fergusonii are pathogenic. It is known to infect open wounds in humans and may also cause bacteraemia or urinary tract infections. Strains causing these infections have been found to be highly resistant to the antibiotic ampicillin, though some are also resistant to gentamicin and chloramphenicol. An antibiotic-resistant strain of the species was found to be associated with an incidence of cystitis in a 52-year-old woman in 2008.\n\n**Staphylococcus aureus** - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staphylococcus_aureus\nStaphylococcus aureus is a Gram-positive round-shaped bacterium, a member of the Firmicutes, and is a usual member of the microbiota of the body, frequently found in the upper respiratory tract and on the skin. It is often positive for catalase and nitrate reduction and is a facultative anaerobe that can grow without the need for oxygen. Although S. aureus usually acts as a commensal of the human microbiota it can also become an opportunistic pathogen, being a common cause of skin infections including abscesses, respiratory infections such as sinusitis, and food poisoning. Pathogenic strains often promote infections by producing virulence factors such as potent protein toxins, and the expression of a cell-surface protein that binds and inactivates antibodies. S. aureus is one of the leading pathogens for deaths associated with Antimicrobial resistance and the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains such as methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) is a worldwide problem in clinical medicine. Despite much research and development, no vaccine for S. aureus has been approved.\n\n![Staphylococcus ](https://i.ibb.co/Kzm0DvQ/1280px-Staphylococcus-aureus-VISA-2.jpg)\n\n**Klebsiella pneumoniae** - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klebsiella_pneumoniae\nKlebsiella pneumoniae is a Gram-negative, non-motile, encapsulated, lactose-fermenting, facultative anaerobic, rod-shaped bacterium. It appears as a mucoid lactose fermenter on MacConkey agar.\n\n![Klebsiella ](https://i.ibb.co/GTPQmYP/Klebsiella-pneumoniae-01.png)\n\nAlthough found in the normal flora of the mouth, skin, and intestines, it can cause destructive changes to human and animal lungs if aspirated, specifically to the alveoli resulting in bloody, brownish or yellow colored jelly like sputum.

At a first glance, it seems that most of these are non-English. The geographic signals in the given data are:\n\n1. Each song in the songs CSV file has a language (some are missing).\n2. The ISRC codes provided in the extra info CSV file contain the country code as the first two characters.\n3. Members' cities are provided in the members CSV file.\n\nI explore one of the combinations with a simple heat map. I might add to it in the future if I find that geography is particularly informative in making recommendations. Some other neat visualizations might be:\n \n - Frequencies of (member city, song language) pairs for listens in the training and testing sets.\n - Frequencies of (language 1, language 2) pairs for users who've listened to a song in both language 1 and language 2."},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"f6d51a39-9f93-4d98-b270-99e75b2e8a0c","_uuid":"f175a012c5303801bffd7b8b2c9bc3e22ad1d5c4"},"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nM = pd.read_csv('../input/members.csv')\nS = pd.read_csv('../input/songs.csv')\nE = pd.read_csv('../input/song_extra_info.csv')\nTRN = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')\nprint('Done reading')","execution_count":40},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"1cdaf677-c524-4f25-8329-43a7a21168a0","_uuid":"54e6d8118e30971deb1da31dd5030a596416b6a2"},"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"source":"# Join S and E to include name and isrc in the same dataframe.\n# There's probably a cleaner/faster way to join, but this is good enough for now.\nS['language'] = S['language'].fillna(-2)\nE['isrc'] = E['isrc'].fillna('na')\nS = S.set_index('song_id', drop=False)\nE = E.set_index('song_id', drop=False)\nSE = S.join(E[['name', 'isrc']])\nSE.head()","execution_count":41},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"2f3aa862-b785-4f37-ac14-e4517aeb443b","_uuid":"d1789541d1b79029775c82191c4ba4da5303d36c"},"cell_type":"code","outputs":[],"source":"# Extract the country codes and languages for all songs.\n# Plot them as a co-occurrence frequency heat-map.

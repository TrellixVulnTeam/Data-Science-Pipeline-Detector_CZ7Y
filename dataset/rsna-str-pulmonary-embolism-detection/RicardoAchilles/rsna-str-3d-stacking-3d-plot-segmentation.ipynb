It also happens to be very helpful.  As clinical radiologists, we expect post-processing, even taking them for granted. However, the magic that occurs behind the scenes is no easy feat, so let’s explore some of that magic.\n\nIn this quest, we will be starting from raw DICOM images. We will extract voxel data from DICOM into numpy arrays, and then perform some low-level operations to normalize and resample the data, made possible using information in the DICOM headers.\n\nThe remainder of the Quest is dedicated to visualizing the data in 1D (by histogram), 2D, and 3D. Finally, we will create segmentation masks that remove all voxel except for the lungs.\n\nProcessing raw DICOM with Python is a little like excavating a dinosaur – you’ll want to have a jackhammer to dig, but also a pickaxe and even a toothbrush for the right situations. Python has all the tools, from pre-packaged imaging process packages handling gigabytes of data at once to byte-level operations on a single voxel.\n\n## Import Packages"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# %reload_ext signature\n# %matplotlib inline\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pydicom\nimport os\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nfrom glob import glob\nfrom mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d import Poly3DCollection\nimport scipy.ndimage\nfrom skimage import morphology\nfrom skimage import measure\nfrom skimage.transform import resize\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\nfrom plotly import __version__\nfrom plotly.offline import download_plotlyjs, init_notebook_mode, plot, iplot\nimport plotly.figure_factory as ff\nfrom plotly.graph_objs import *\ninit_notebook_mode(connected=True) ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Setting paths\nThen, let's specify a specific DICOM study we can take a closer look.

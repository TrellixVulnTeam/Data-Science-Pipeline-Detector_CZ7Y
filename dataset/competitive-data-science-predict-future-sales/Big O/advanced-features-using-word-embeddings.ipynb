For both items and categories, we can see common words that suggest similarity (e.g. the PC, PS3 and XBox versions of *007 Legends*).\n2. We can see a mix of both Russian and English text.\n\nThe first point is exactly what we were hoping for. This suggests we can use some text pre-processing to help our models learn which items are related. Let's look at the options:\n\n* **One-hot encoding (bag-of-words).** Tells us which words have been seen in each item with a simple true/false flag. Doesn't account for the similarity of word meanings though, or the importance of each word in the description. It also can't give us a useful comparison between different pairs of items: difference is only measured by how many exact word matches there are in each description - the non-common words do not contribute to the similarity measurement.\n* **TF-IDF vectorisation.** Slightly better than one-hot encoding, as we now give each word a score based on its importance. Apart from this though, it has many of the same shortcomings as OHE.\n* **Word embeddings.** Word embeddings are the output of a neural network that has been trained to spot words that often appear in similar contexts. Word embeddings are a very powerful way of representing words and sentences. Not only can they tell us if the same words are appearing in two different item descriptions, but they can also measure how similar the *meanings* of the words are.\n\nWord embeddings would be a good option, but how do we create them? We could train our own word embedding model (or better still, a document embedding model which also accounts for how the words in our item descriptions are grouped), but to capture the full meaning of each word (and therefore spot any similarities between items) we need a large corpus of data for our model to learn the meanings. We will only spot similaries from our own training data if we keep seeing the exact same words appearing in similar items. These similarities could be identified with a simple one-hot or TF-IDF encoder, however we want to use word embeddings to identify much more subtle similarities, e.g. that *PS3* and *XBox* products are similar.

[Exploiting Similarities among Languages for Machine Translation Mikolov et. al, 2013.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.4168.pdf) shows us that word vector spaces for different languages share some linear similarities in their structure. This means we can use a tranformation matrix to convert word vectors from a source space (e.g. Russian) into a target space (e.g. English), and the transformed vector should be close to vectors in the target space with a similar meaning.\n\nThe research paper shows that we can learn the transformation matrix from some training data using Ordinary Least Squares regression. The data we need is just pairs of Russian words with their English translations.\n\nA Russian/English dictionary would make ideal training data, but we don't have one available so we'll have to do something with the data we have instead. A simple translation training set was produced by running all of the words in the category and item names through the Google translate API. This gave ~10,500 word pairs to learn a translation matrix from.\n\nTo make this technique reusable in other competitions, the code for producing these translation models was put into a separate package called `transvec` which is now available on PyPi. `transvec` allows you to convert word vectors from any number of source languages into the vector space of a single 'target' language.

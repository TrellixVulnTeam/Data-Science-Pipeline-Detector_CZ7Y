Daily historical data from January 2013 to October 2015.\n* **test.csv** - the test set. We need to forecast the sales for these shops and products for November 2015.\n* **sample_submission.csv** - a sample submission file in the correct format.\n* **items.csv** - supplemental information about the items/products.\n* **item_categories.csv**  - supplemental information about the items categories.\n* **shops.csv** - supplemental information about the shops.\n\nIn the next sections, we will explore each one of these files in detail."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Exploring *sales_train.csv*\n\nWe begin this task by importing the csv file into our notebook.

Users can create and distribute an interactive and shareable dashboard, which depict the trends, variations, and density of the data in the form of graphs and charts. Tableau can connect to files, relational and Big Data sources to acquire and process data. The software allows data blending and real-time collaboration, which makes it very unique. It is used by businesses, academic researchers, and many government organizations for visual data analysis. \n\nAs a leading data visualization tool, Tableau has many desirable and unique features. Its powerful data discovery and exploration application allows you to answer important questions in seconds. You can use Tableau's drag and drop interface to visualize any data, explore different views, and even combine multiple databases easily. It does not require any complex scripting. Anyone who understands the business problems can address it with a visualization of the relevant data. After analysis, sharing with others is as easy as publishing to Tableau Server.\n\n## Tableau Features\n\nTableau provides solutions for all kinds of industries, departments, and data environments. Following are some unique features which enable Tableau to handle diverse scenarios.\n\n**Speed of Analysis** − \n\nAs it does not require high level of programming expertise, any user with access to data can start using it to derive value from the data.\n\n**Self-Reliant** − \n\nTableau does not need a complex software setup. The desktop version which is used by most users is easily installed and contains all the features needed to start and complete data analysis.\n\n**Visual Discovery** − \n\nThe user explores and analyzes the data by using visual tools like colors, trend lines, charts, and graphs. There is very little script to be written as nearly everything is done by drag and drop.\n\n**Blend Diverse Data Sets** − \n\nTableau allows you to blend different relational, semistructured and raw data sources in real time, without expensive up-front integration costs. The users don’t need to know the details of how data is stored.\n\n**Architecture Agnostic** − \n\nTableau works in all kinds of devices where data flows. Hence, the user need not worry about specific hardware or software requirements to use Tableau.\n\n**Real-Time Collaboration** − \n\nTableau can filter, sort, and discuss data on the fly and embed a live dashboard in portals like SharePoint site or Salesforce. You can save your view of data and allow colleagues to subscribe to your interactive dashboards so they see the very latest data just by refreshing their web browser.\n\n**Centralized Data** \n\n Tableau server provides a centralized location to manage all of the organization’s published data sources. You can delete, change permissions, add tags, and manage schedules in one convenient location. It’s easy to schedule extract refreshes and manage them in the data server. Administrators can centrally define a schedule for extracts on the server for both incremental and full refreshes.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import YouTubeVideo\nYouTubeVideo('YfE9jBq002s', width=800, height=400)\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-input":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import YouTubeVideo\nYouTubeVideo('7Jl-RwkzqQ4', width=800, height=400)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Use Case 1: US Drought -EDA- Tableau & Alteryx Integration!!!!\n\nSource : http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/ The U.S. Drought Monitor, established in 1999, is a weekly map of drought conditions produced jointly by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the National Drought Mitigation Center at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln.\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor website is hosted and maintained by the drought center.The weekly maps are released at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Standard Time each Thursday and are assessments of past conditions based on data through 7 a.m.\n\nEastern time (8 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time) the preceding Tuesday. The map is based on measurements of climatic, hydrologic and soil conditions as well as reported impacts and observations from more than 350 contributors around the country. Eleven climatologists from the partner organizations take turns serving as the lead author each week. The authors examine all the data and use their best judgment to reconcile any differences among sources.\n\nWe stress that the map isn’t a strictly quantitative product and the community of drought observers lends credibility to the state-of-the-art blend of science and subjectivity.\n\nThe U.S. Drought Monitor is used by policymakers and media in discussions of drought and in allocations of drought relief. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Farm Service Agency uses the U.S. Drought Monitor to distribute relief through the Livestock Forage Disaster Program, the Livestock Assistance Grant Program, and the Non-Fat Dry Milk Program.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service also uses the U.S. Drought Monitor to determine the replacement period for livestock sold because of drought. As part of its response to the drought of 2012, the U.S. Department of Agriculture streamlined the process for secretarial disaster declarations, making declarations nearly automatic for a county shown in severe drought on the U.S. Drought Monitor for eight consecutive weeks.\n\nPlease feel free to play around with different flight combinations to observe the visualisations\n\nThe following visualisations comprises of\n\nThe Thinking Behind the Map\n\nMap Basis Drought intensity categories are based on:\n\nfive key indicators (listed in the table below)\n\ndrought impacts\n\nlocal reports from more than 350 expert observers around the country\n\n- Indicators\n\nThe accompanying drought severity classification table shows the ranges for each indicator for each dryness level. Because the ranges of the various indicators often don't coincide, the final drought category tends to be based on what the majority of the indicators show and on local observations. The analysts producing the map also weigh the indices according to how well they perform in various parts of the country and at different times of the year.\n\nAdditional indicators are often needed in the West, where winter snowfall in the mountains has a strong bearing on water supplies.\n\nIt is this combination of the best available data, local observations and experts’ best judgment that makes the U.S. Drought Monitor more versatile than other drought indicators.\n\nWhat You See\nThe Drought Monitor summary map identifies general areas of drought and labels them by intensity.\n\nD1 is the least intense level and D4 the most intense. Drought is defined as a moisture deficit bad enough to have social, environmental or economic effects.\n\nD0 areas are not in drought, but are experiencing abnormally dry conditions that could turn into drought or are recovering from drought but are not yet back to normal.\n\nIn this kernel I have used the spatial data(shape files to come up with visualisation of drought across United States from 2000 to till date.\n\n- The exploratory data visualisation is done using Tableau and Alteryx is used to combine the 909 shapefiles for the period between 2000 - 2018 to come up with a single shape file to visualize week on week changes.For more details of the source of shape files please visit http://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/Data/GISData.aspx\n\n**- I have created the visualisation animation but if you like to visit my tableau site please do visit at https://public.tableau.com/profile/pavan.kumar.sanagapati#!/","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import IFrame\nIFrame('https://public.tableau.com/views/USDroughtIntensityAnalysis2000-2018/USDroughtIntensity2000-2018?:embed=y&:display_count=yes', width=1000, height=1000)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Use Case 2: Exploratory Data Analysis - Global Terrorism !!\n![](https://image.slidesharecdn.com/globalterrorism-121218085057-phpapp02/95/global-terrorism-12-638.jpg?cb=1355820714)\nInformation on more than 180,000  Terrorist Attacks\n\nThe Global Terrorism Database  (GTD) is an open-source database including information on terrorist attacks around the world from 1970 through 2017.

The widths of the bands are directly proportional to energy production, utilization and losses. The primary energy sources are gas, electricity and coal/oil and represent energy inputs at the left hand side of the Sankey diagram. They can also visualize the energy accounts, material flow accounts on a regional or national level, and also the breakdown of cost of item or services.\n\nSankey diagrams put a visual emphasis on the major transfers or flows within a system. They are helpful in locating dominant contributions to an overall flow. Often, Sankey diagrams show conserved quantities within defined system boundaries.\n\n## Case Study - African Mobile Data Profitability Analysis\n\nSource - https://www.superdatascience.com/case-study-014-tableau-african-mobile-profitability-analysis/\nYou are a Data Consultant brought in by African Mobile, a mobile company that aggressively expanded across the entire continent of Africa beginning in 2013. Business has been humming along for the past four years, and they would like you to conduct a profitability analysis of their business. This will involve looking at not only profitability, but also Salesperson performance. African Mobile has requested the following:\n\nAn interactive dashboard showing Profit by City, tied to Profit by Segment and a Profit Trend (Use a map, a bar chart, and a line chart). African Mobile should be able to select a City on the map and see the other charts adjust.\nAn interactive scatterplot showing the relationship between Profit and Sales by either Region, Country, or City, depending on their choice (Use a scatter and a parameter).\nAn interactive Salesperson analysis showing Contracts Sold by each person, as well as a second chart showing difference from a selected Salesperson (Use two bar charts and a parameter).\nA two-way matrix, over time, tracking Salesperson quarterly performance against benchmarks (in parentheses) for Contracts Sold (10) and Close Rate (30%) (Use the Pages functionality).\n\n**Challenge**\n\nAfrican Mobile has long experience with Tableau and is not easily impressed. Cap your workbook off with a Sankey Chart showing how Sales flow between Segment and Region to really blow them away.\n## Sankey Chart\nThis is Tableau data visualisation representation of the African Mobile data obtained from the above source to display profitability analysis of mobile users across segment and region to clear articulate the profitability and areas where the sales team need to focus for improvement.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from IPython.display import IFrame\nIFrame('https://public.tableau.com/views/AfricanMobileSalesData-SankeyChart/Dashboard1?:embed=y&:display_count=yes', width=800, height=925)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Use Case 5: US Wages -Tableau Visualisation\nThe U.S. Department Zip Codes database shows the average and cumulative wages data extracted from the following source .\n\nI have come up with tableau data visualisation to show case the locations within US using 81,831 zipcode observations to show the total wages for each location using the HexBin chart.

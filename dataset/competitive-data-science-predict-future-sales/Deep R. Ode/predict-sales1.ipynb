If you see our test data, we have been asked to predict *monthly* sales for next one month for given items in a given shop & it's 214k rows. We are not given any information apart from item_id and shop_id, especially we are not given item_price for test set. Other features like item_category, shop_city can be fetched from the training data using item_id and shop_id, however item_price understandabaly varies across different dates even for the same shop & item pair. Getting item_price for our test data, is going to be another challenge we have to deal with.\n\nClearly our current sales_train dataframe and test data are not consistent because our sales_train currently has data for non-zero daily sales only. Following two solutions to this came to my mind, however there are other approaches discussed in other notebooks.\n\nApproach 1. We can make predictions for each day in upcoming month and add total sales for each shop & item combination to get monthly sales prediction. If we follow this approach, we have to make 214k * 30 predictions & then again reprocess them to find sum to get monthly count. Also, on many days sales would be zero and our current training data only has non-zero entries, so we will (probably) need to teach our model somehow - by modifying training data - that most of the days will have zero sales. If to do so we need to add zero rows, our training set, which already has <> rows, will become very large along with large test set. So I haven't used this approach.\n\nApproach 2. Instead, we can restructure our training set to look more like test set. To do so, we create a new dataframe, where each record shows monthly sales of particular item_id and shop_id with average price for the same. To find average price, we first group rows by month, item_id and shop_id and find average price of that group, monthly sales count is found by taking sum of daily sales count of this group."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"monthly_group = sales_train.groupby(['date_block_num', 'shop_id', 'item_id'])\nmonthly_count = monthly_group['item_cnt_day'].sum()  # Total number of items sold in month.\nmonthly_avg_price = monthly_group['item_price'].mean()  # Average price of all items sold in month.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"monthly_count.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"I was very optimistic while I made weekday feature.

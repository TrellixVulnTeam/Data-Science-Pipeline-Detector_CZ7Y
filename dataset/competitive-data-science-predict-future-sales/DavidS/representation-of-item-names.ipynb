Choosing only N most important features is some solution, although obviously the rest of the words also can be crucial.\n\nIn this kernel, I'd like to propose a few methods of representing text features in a more compact way.

Then, I used get_sentence_vector() to infer vector with constant length for each item name, to get rid of a problem with variable sentence length.

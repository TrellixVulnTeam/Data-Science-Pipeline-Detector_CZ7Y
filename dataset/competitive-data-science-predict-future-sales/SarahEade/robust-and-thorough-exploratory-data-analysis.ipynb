This will save you time in the long run**_. It will help identify potentital data problems and might curate new modeling ideas.\n\nYou can spend a very long time on EDA, but at the very least, be able to answer the following questions:\n## What information is contained in each dataset?\n1. What is the size of the stored data? This will affect how you may store, access, and process the data. Working with MB of data vs TB require different tools and hardware.\n    1. Number of rows\n    1. Number of columns\n    1. How is it stored?\n1. Look at a couple of example rows to get a better sense of what it looks like\n1. Column fields\n    1. What are the descriptions?\n    1. Which are unique allegedly? (Always good to verify!)\n    1. Which columns will be feature variables and which one is the predictor variable\n    1. If you have multiple datasets, how can the data be joined together? Are there common columns that you can join the datasets to?\n    1. Some examples of values for each column\n    1. Types: does anything need to be converted? E.g. strings into dates, strings into floats, etc.\n    1. Any metadata explaining possible encodings? E.g. in sku numbers, the first two digits may represent a retail's department for that particular item. There may be more information contained in some of the columns.\n    \n## What is the quality?\n1. Any missing data? Can it be inputted or should it be dropped?\n1. Any duplicates?\n1. Outliers? Should they be removed or adjusted?\n1. Unusual values? E.g. negative values for price, or very old dates, etc. What assumptions can be made? What cannot be corrected?\n1. Check any assumptions if possible, are values actually unique?\n\n## What are some basic statistics? \n1. Mean\n1. Median\n1. Quartiles\n1. Count of distinct values\n\n## What does the data look like when plotted?\n1. Histograms/Density plots\n1. Box plots\n1. Scatter plots\n1. Line plots\n\nNow let's get started! Feel free to add additional tips in the columns--I'll try to update it here.\n\n.................................................................................................................................................................................................................................."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# What information is contained in each dataset?\n\n## Size and Format\n\nWe have been given 6 datasets, all as csv's, I downloaded and unzipped them all to get the size.\n\n| Dataset Name  | Size (unzipped) | \n|---------------|-----------------|\n|sales_train    |94.6 MB          |\n|test           |3.2 MB           |\n|items          |1.6 MB           |\n|item_catgories |4 KB             |\n|shops          |3 KB             |\n\nGreat news!

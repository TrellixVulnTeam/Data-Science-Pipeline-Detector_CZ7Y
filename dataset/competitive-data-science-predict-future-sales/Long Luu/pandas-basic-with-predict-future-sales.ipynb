Do not count the items, that were sold but returned back later.\n\n- Fill total_num_items_sold and days arrays\n- Then compute variance. Remember, there can be differences in how you normalize variance (biased or unbiased estimate, see [link](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/496627/the-difference-between-unbiased-biased-estimator-variance)). Compute unbiased estimate (use the - right value for ddof argument in pd.var or np.var).\n- If there were no sales at a given day, do not impute missing value with zero, just ignore that day\n\nAnswer: `117167.70229885059`"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

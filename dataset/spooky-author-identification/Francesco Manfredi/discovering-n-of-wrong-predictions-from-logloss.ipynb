As an example, a submission that scores 0.44097 will score 3.93369 if \"extremized\" and resubmitted.  \n\nThe useful thing of this process is that when submitting these extreme predictions we know exactly how much a wrong prediction contributes to our score, so we can easily find the number of wrong predictions.\n\n## Calculating the number of wrong predictions\n\nIn logistic loss both our right predictions and wrong predictions contribute to the loss score in reason of their distance from the real thing. (i.e. we also get penalized if we make a right prediction with 0.9 probability instead of 1).  \n  \nWhen submitting extremized predictions we have fixed contributions from right and wrong assignments as follows:  \n  \n$$log1 = log(1 - 1e-15)\\ for\\ right\\ predictions$$  \n  \n$$log2 = log(1e-15)\\ for\\ right\\ predictions$$  \n  \nHaving determined these quantities we can now express our logloss score as follows:  \n\n$$ logloss= -\\frac{1}{N}[(N-w)log1 + wlog2] $$\n  \nand so we have\n  \n$$w = N  \\frac{log1-logloss}{log2-log1} $$\n\nwhere w is the number of wrong predictions.\n\n## Let's put it in code!","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{}},{"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np"},{"source":"### First thing, we need to \"extremize\" our predictions as described above.","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{}},{"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"source":"def boolToExtreme(b):\n    \"\"\"Service function for predToExtremeValues\"\"\"\n    if b:\n        return np.float128(1 - np.float128(1e-15))\n    return np.float128(1e-15)\n\ndef predToExtremeValues(predictions):\n    \"\"\"Get the predictions in the form required for submission\n    as a pandas DataFrame and edit the probability to be exactly\n    the extreme values 10^15 and 1-10^15\"\"\"\n    \n    predictions = predictions.apply(lambda el: [p==el.max() for p in el], axis=1)\n    predictions = predictions.applymap(boolToExtreme)\n    return predictions"},{"source":"### Then we build our calculating function","cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{}},{"outputs":[],"cell_type":"code","metadata":{},"execution_count":null,"source":"def howManyWrong(logloss, N):\n    \"\"\"Returns the estimate number of wrong predictions based on the\n    Spooky Author Challenge evaluations system. logloss is the score,\n    N is the number of observations\"\"\"\n    \n    log1 = np.float128(np.log(np.float128(1 - 1e-15)))\n    log2 = np.float128(np.log(np.float128(1e-15)))\n    \n    w = N * ((log1 - logloss) / (log2 - log1))\n    return w\n"},{"source":"## How to use it\nSo here is the scenario I have in mind:  \nsuppose we have a prediction csv files as required by the challange and you want to know how many wrong predictions there were.

(It shold not be confused with [H2O DriverlessAI](https://www.h2o.ai/products/h2o-driverless-ai/), which is a commercial product and built from an entirely different code base.) H2O’s AutoML can be used for automating the machine learning workflow, which includes automatic training and tuning of many models within a user-specified time-limit. Stacked Ensembles – one based on all previously trained models, another one on the best model of each family – will be automatically trained on collections of individual models to produce highly predictive ensemble models which, in most cases, will be the top performing models in the AutoML Leaderboard.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import h2o\nprint(h2o.__version__)\nfrom h2o.automl import H2OAutoML\n\nh2o.init(max_mem_size='16G')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\ntrain = h2o.import_file(\"/kaggle/input/trends-train-test-creator/train.csv\")\nfeatures = np.load('/kaggle/input/trends-train-test-creator/features.npy')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"x = list(features)\ny = 'domain2_var2'\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"aml = H2OAutoML(max_models=500, seed=47, max_runtime_secs=31000)\naml.train(x=x, y=y, training_frame=train)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# View the AutoML Leaderboard\nlb = aml.leaderboard\nlb.head(rows=lb.nrows)  # Print all rows instead of default (10 rows)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# The leader model is stored here\naml.leader","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"test = h2o.import_file(\"/kaggle/input/trends-train-test-creator/test.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"preds = aml.predict(test)\npreds.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"preds = preds.as_data_frame().values","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"np.save('preds_domain2_var2', preds)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

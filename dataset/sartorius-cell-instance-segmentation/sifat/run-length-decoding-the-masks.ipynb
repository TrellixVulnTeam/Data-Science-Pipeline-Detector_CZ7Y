Digital images are used for professional and personal use ranging from official documents to social media. Thus, any Organization or individual needs to store and share a large number of images. One of the most common issues associated with using images is the potentially large file-size of the image. Advancements in image acquisition technology and an increase in the popularity of digital content means that images now have very high resolutions and high quality, inevitably leading to an increase in size. Image compression has become one of the most important parts of image processing these days due to this. The goal is to achieve the least size possible for an image while not compromising on the quality of the image, that gives us the perfect balance.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#### Understanding the Algorithm\nLet's take the input string as \"wwwwbbbwwwwwbbbbb\".

I don't know if this will work for competitions or not. You can change the C++ functions and click **Run All** and it should work.\n\nA comparrison with Cython at the end. It turns out it may be better to use cython  after all instead of messing about with C++! Whatever is best for you. One downside of Cython is it seems like it takes a very long time to compile large files compared to C++. Probably use Cython if you only have a small function to speed up and C++ if you have many functions.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Tutorial\n==","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"It is important to keep a track of the handles of the libraries you have loaded and then unload them before trying to recompile the libaries.

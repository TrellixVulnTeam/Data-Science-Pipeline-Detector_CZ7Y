Conventional Method vs Distance Matrix API\n\n### Conventional method\nThe conventional method, a.k.a [Haversine formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haversine_formula), is a very accurate way of computing distances between two points on the surface of a sphere using the latitude and longitude of the two points, one of its primary applications is navigation. You can find its realization in this [excellent notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/madhurisivalenka/cleansing-eda-modelling-lgbm-xgboost-starters) by Sivalenka. \nHowever, since the formula returns the shortest distance between two points which, as you know, is impossible for us to take when it comes to daily traffics.\n\n### Distance Matrix API\nIf you want to get more accurate distances from lat/lon pairs, one you should consider is `Distance Matrix API`. It calculates distances base on google map algorithm, which is being used in our daily life. No matter you trust google map or not, it could definitely get you better results compares to the `Haversine formula`. Moreover, it also provides you to choose from a list of travel types, such as driving, walking, transit etc., and returns you the travel duration of the given mode.\n\nHowever, there are two major drawbacks of `Distance Matrix API`, the first is time consuming, it takes about 20~23 sec to process 1000 inputs in my cumputer, so you should prepare for a long run-time if your dataset is large. \n\nThe second, which I think is the biggest disadvantage, is you only get limited free request number to this API. Google provides you a $300 free trial to its products, after you run out this free trial account, you need to pay for additional access. As your reference, I ran out my free trial, and it completed about 650 thousans of samples. So make sure what you are doing before jump into it.\n\n### Let's get start!"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":false,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# install package \n!pip install googlemaps","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd \nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt \nimport seaborn as sns\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\nimport time\nimport gc\n\npd.options.display.float_format = '{:,.2f}'.format","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":false},"cell_type":"code","source":"train = pd.read_csv('../input/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction/train.csv', nrows = 700_000) \nprint(train.shape)\ntrain.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Load testing\ntest = pd.read_csv('../input/new-york-city-taxi-fare-prediction/test.csv')\nprint(test.shape)\ntest.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### NaN Check"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.isna().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 2.

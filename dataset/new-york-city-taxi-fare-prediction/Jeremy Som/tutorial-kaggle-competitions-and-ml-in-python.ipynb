Essentials - competition basics, reading and understanding the data\n\nKaggle competitions are a great way to learn and improve oneself in a competitive environment. Throughout this kernel, we will see how they work and what workflow to follow to successfully participate into one of them.\nLet's start by introducing the 4 types of learning ; supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, reinforcement\n\n1. **In supervised learning**, the model is trained using labels - for example, we give it images of animals, and we tell it what animal it is. Then, we give it unlabelled images and the model try to guess what it is based on what it learned. Supervised learning is commonly used for classification and regression problems. Example of popular algorithms : Linear regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Neural networks, Decision Trees (such as random forest), Naive Bayes, Nearest Neighbor. It is widely used in predictive modelling.\n\n2. **In unsupervised learning**, the model isn't given any label. Clustering (grouping of similar points into clusters) and anomaly detection are examples of unsupervised learning. Popular algorithms : k-means clustering and Association rules\n\n3. **Semi-supervised learning** is a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning ; some data are labelled, some are not.\n\n4. **In reinforcement learning**, the model learns by trial and error. It learns from past experience and tries to use this knowledge (feedback) to make better decisions. It is used for self-driving cars and was the technique used by AlphaGO. It is also used in all robotics related applications. Popular algorithms are Q-learning and deep adversarial networks.\n\nAs you probably guessed, predicting taxi fares is a supervised learning task.\n\nTime to code !

This is normal, because it is the column we want to predict.\nWe also see that this file has 9'914 rows, whereas the original train set had 55'423'856 rows. This is because when we split the original dataset into train and test sets, we want to have more data to create the model, and less to test it. A general rule of thumb is to use ~80% for training and ~20% for testing. Here, ~98% of the original data (55'423'856 rows) is used for training, and 2% (9914 rows) for testing. In reality, it is a little bit more complicated : Kaggle internally splits the test set into 2 subsets : one of them is public, and the other one is private. When submitting results in the competition, the leaderboard shows performances on the public test data. The private test data are used at the end of the competition to determine the final standings.\n\nUsually, we woudn't want to subset the train data the way we did because we lose information and might decrease our model's performances. Also, we altered the rule of thumb (80% train, 20% test). However, to keep things simple, we will assume it is acceptable here.\n\nWhat is the sample_submission.csv file that was listed earlier ?

Indeed, once we're satisfied with our model (when predictions are good enough according to some metrics), the predictions done on the test set are saved in a CSV file that will be submitted to Kaggle.\nKaggle knows the actual fare amount values, and compares them with our predictions. It then calculates a metric from this comparison and show the results on the leaderboard.\n\nEach competition specifies a metric that will be used to rank the participants. For example, common metrics for classification problems are Area Under the ROC (AUC) and F1 Score, whereas Mean Squared/Absolute Error (MSE/MAE) are common for regression problems. Our goal is then to build a model that optimizes the given metric.\n\nNow that we know the essentials about the data and the submitting form, before creating a model, we must identify the problem type ; for example, is it a classification problem ? Or is it a regression problem ?\n\n## 2. Identifying the problem and creating a model\n\nWe saw earlier that in this case, we want to predict the fare amount of taxis rides. Because it is a continuous variable, this problem will be addressed with regression models.\n\nThe simplest regression method is, of course, the linear regression. More complex regression methods include artificial neural networks (after all, they are \"just\" regression models). However, it is important to use appropriate tools and start with simple models. This is why we will first build a simple linear regression.\n\n### 2.1 Linear regression model"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's start by building a simple linear regression model using Scikit-Learn.

Let's go through some theory !\n\nAs we saw earlier, regression methods are part of supervised learning, which requires that both inputs (variables) and desired outputs (labels or target value) be provided to the algorithm. This latter uses data to infer a function from which it does predictions. These predictions are then compared to the target values and the accuracy of prediction can be quantified using different metrics (such as the MSE). Once training is complete, the algorithm applies what it learned to new data (the test set).\n\nThe important words in the previous paragraph are that the **model uses data to infer a function from which it does predictions**. In fact, model training consist of finding a function that explains the data points observed in the training set. Then, the model obtained (=the function) is used to predict new data points.\n\nIn a linear regression with 2 variables, the function used by the model to fit the data is of the form *y = ax + b*, where *y* is the target, *x* is a single variable, and *a* and *b* are the parameters of the model that we want to learn. More precisely, *a* is the coefficient and *b* is the observation noise.\n\nThe question becomes : how do we choose *a* and *b* ? --> We minimize a loss function called Ordinary least squares (OLS). In Scikit-learn, this is done under the hood. The idea is to find *a* and *b* that minimize the chosen metric.\n\nIn higher dimensions, the formula above generalizes to *y = a1x1 + a2x2 + a3x3 + anxn + b*. Note that here, the coefficient for each variable *a* and *b* must be specified. Concretely, we pass to Scikit-learn 2 arrays : one containing the variables, and one with the target.\n\nAnother very important concept is the notion of overfitting. \n\n**Overfitting**\n\nIn the previous model, data were split into 2 subsets ; one for training and one for testing. The model used the training data to estimate a function describing the link between inputs and outputs.\nTwo undesirable cases may occur when learning from data :\n\n1. **Overfitting** : this phenomenon occurs when the model learns the training data too accurately. The estimated function can thus be very complex and result in a model that has very poor generalization performance (generalization is the ability to make predictions based on new, unused data points)\n\n1. **Underfitting**  (or oversmoothing) : in this case, the model is close to or even linear and is unable to do good predictions.\n\nThe figure below illustrates these cases :\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://i.imgur.com/1DUUmAd.png)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Imagine that the points represent the price of a taxi ride as a function of distance (*x* = distance, *y* = price). Blue dots are used to create the model, and red ones are used to test it. The *true function* is the unknown function that we want our model to find. In this scenario, we have the following cases :\n\n* Underfitting : we see that a simple linear regression is too simple to capture the relationship between *x* and *y*. Both training and testing errors (blue and red vertical lines) are important. This could be the reason why our model had important testing errors.\n\n* Overfitting : in this case, the model is very complex. Training errors are close to 0 but testing errors are important. Obviously, we can't have this situation with a linear model, but it can happen with the more complex models derived with neural networks. Because data consists of information and noise, it is not desirable that the model learns the data by heart.\n\n* Optimal : We almost found the *true function*, training and testing errors are low.\n\nFinding a good model is a chellenging task. However, there is something we can do: instead of using 2 subsets (train and test), we can use 3 ! In this approach, the train set is used for parameters estimation (for example *a* and *b* from *y = ax + b*), the validation set is used to select a model (the one with the best generalization properties), and the test set is used to assess the final performance of the model. In other words, we build several models and and use the validation set to select the best one. Then, we use this model on the test set.\nThe problem is that creating 3 subsets reduces the size of the training set, which can drecrease performances. To address this issue, a very common method consists of doing a so called cross-validation : instead of 3 subsets, we split the data in 2. But this time, the train set becomes the validation-train, while the test set remains unchanged. Then, a K-fold cross-validation is performed on the validation-train subset for parameter estimation.\n\n\n**Cross-validation**\n\nThe results on the test set depend on how the data were split. It is possible that the train/test split was not representative of the data, and that the model was trained with it. Cross-validation consists in splitting the validation-train set into K subsets : the training is done on K-1 subsets, and the last one is used for validation. This process is repeated K times with K different splits between training and validation data. We then have K models to chose from. To resume, CV avoids the problem of the chosen metric being dependant on the train/test split.\n\nHow many folds should be used ?\n\nTo answer this question, let's first talk about the bias, the variance, and the bias-variance tradeoff, since CV and this latter are related. \n\nThe **bias** represents the difference between the average prediction of the model and the true target value. Models with high bias are oversimplified (underfitting), with high errors both on training and test data.\n\nThe **variance** is the variability of model prediction for a given data point. Models with high variance perform well on training data, but have high errors on test data. In other words, they overfit and do not generalize well.\n\nThe **bias-variance tradeoff** : a too simple model with very few parameters may have a high bias and a low variance. A more complex model with many parameters may have a high variance and a low bias. Therefore, a good model has to be somewhere inbetween ; we want to minimize the bias and the variance. So, we want to have enough data to train, but also enough data to validate. If K is too large, there are not enough data points in the validation set to confidently evaluate the model. Usually, a large K decreases the bias but increase the variance and the computation time (because we fit and predict more time). A small K means less trained models to evaluate.\n\nIn short :\n\nLow K = faster, less variance, more bias\n\nHigh K = slower, more variance, less bias\n\nUsually, 5 or 10-folds CV is a good starting point. Increasing K to the point where K = n is called *leave-one-out cross-validation* (LOOCV)\n\n**Regularization**\n\nWe saw that performing a CV can help obtaining a better model. What else can we do ? We can **regularize** the regression. We also saw that fitting a linear regression mimizes a loss function called Ordinary least squares (OLS) to chose a coefficient (or parameter) for each feature variable. The problem is that if those parameters are large, we can get overfitting (in high dimensional space, so if we have many variables). This is why we alter the loss function, so that it penalizes large coefficients (=regularization).\n\nThere are different types of regularized regressions :\n\n* **Lasso** (Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression, in which *loss function = OLS + alpha x sum(abs(ai))*. Lasso can be used for feature selection, that is to select important variables of the dataset, because it shrinks the coefficients of less important features to 0. Lasso is also called L1 regularization because the regularization term is the L1 norm of the coefficients.\n\n* **Ridge** regression, in which *loss function = OLS + alpha x sum(ai^2)*, where *alpha* is a parameter that controls model complexity and that we have to chose. We also see that when *alpha* = 0, we get back OLS. When alpha is very large, the penalization is strong and the model is simple, which can lead to underfitting. Ridge regression is also called L2 regularization and is the one that interests us here.\n\n* **Elastic net** regularization, that combines L1 and L2 regularization.\n\nIn both regressions, we have to chose an *alpha*, and parameters *a* and *b*. Such parameters are called hyperparameters. How do we chose these parameters ?\n\n**Hyperparameter tuning**\n\nThis approach consists of trying different hyperparameter values, and see how they perform. In the end, we keep those which give the best model. It is important to use CV when tuning.\nIn practice, we chose a grid of values that we want to try for the hyperparameter and we perform K-fold CV for each value in the grid. This method is called **gridsearch**.\n\nBefore we do this, there is one last thing we can do to improve our model : preprocessing the data. It is often said that this step takes 80% of the time when preparing a model. \n\n**Preprocessing the data**\n\nThis process is generally done during the so called EDA (exploration data analysis). In this latter, we usually use visualizations to see the distribution of the data, to spot outliers, trends, NAs, and so on. We also look at summary statistics, which can give a lot of information.\nIn ML, categorical variables are transformed into numerical variables and data are often normalized.\n\nIn this kernel, we already removed the NAs, so we don't have to worry about it. We still have to scale our data, because many models use some form of distance to inform them. If features have different scale, they can influence the model. This is called data normalization. There are different ways to perform it, such as standardization (subtract the mean and divide by variance -> all features are centered around 0 and have variance 1). We can also subtract the minimum and divide by the range (minimum 0 and maximum 1) or normalize so that the data ranges from -1 to 1.\n\nNow, let's look at some statistics of the data to find potential outliers."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"trn_data.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Looking at these statistics give useful information : we see that the minimum *fare_amount* is negative and that the maximum *passenger_count* is 208.

In this section, we will look at one of the most basic neural network architecture, called **feedforward neural networks**. Once again, it is important to start with simple models.\n\nArtificial neural networks aim to reproduce the way their biological analogous works. The basic idea is that a neuron receives information and process them to produce an output. A neural network consists of 3 parts : an input layer, a hidden layer, and an output layer. The following image illustrates the basic concept of NN :"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://i.imgur.com/nBSgAhw.png)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"This setup contains one hidden layer consisting of 4 neurons. However, the size of each layer is not arbitrary :\n\n- The size (number of neurons) of the input layer depends on the number of features in the data used for the prediction ; if 5 features are used, then the input layer contains 5 neurons.\n\n- The size of the hidden layer can be found by trial and error. We can also use a popular formula : *Nh = Ns / (a * (Ni + N0))*, where *Nh* is the number of neurons in the hidden layer, *Ns* is the number of sample in the training set, *a* is a scaling factor, *Ni* is the number of input neurons and *n0* is the number of output neurons. The number of hidden layers depends on the task. Some networks use several hidden layers with up to billions of neurons. The term deep learning is derived from how deep the model is (how many hidden layers)\n\n- The size of the output layer depends on the desired outcome. For example, 1 neuron is used for regression, while multicall classification uses more than 1.\n\nLet's come back to the model. Each input (*x*) has its own weight (*w*), and each neuron has a weight (*b*) called bias. \n\nA neuron receives multiple inputs which pass through a combination function (sum) that combines them into a single value. Although different operators can be used (max/min of weighted inputs, logical AND or OR of the values), a weighted summation (each input is multiplied by its weight and these products are added together) is the most common one.\n\nThen, a transfer function (*f*) calculates the output value from the result of the combination function. Both these functions constitute the so called **activation function**. The most common transfer functions are based on the biological model in which the output remains very low until the combined inputs reach a threshold value. When this value is reached, the neuron is activated and the output is high. Thus, a neuron has the property that small changes in the inputs can have relatively large effects on the output when combined values lie within a middle range. On the other hand, important changes in the inputs can have a very limited effect on the output for combined values far from the middle range. This is a typical nonlinear behavior, and partly constitutes the power of neural networks. Note that the case in which neurons use a linear transfer function is equivalent to perform a linear regression !\nThe most common transfer functions are S-shaped, among which the logistic function (sigmoid) produces output values in the range 0, 1, and the hyperbolic tangent in -1, 1.\nActivation functions are important because they introduce nonlinear properties to the networks, which are then able to model linear, nearlinear and nonlinear problems.\n\nThe following image resumes these concepts by showing a detailed view of a neuron:"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://i.imgur.com/TYyvcOi.png)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The different transfer functions are : green = sigmoid, orange = linear, blue = hyperbolic tangent. Note that any infinetely differentiable nonlinear function would work, and a network can use different functions in its neurons.\n\nThe hyperparameters (that can be optimized) in NNs are : the weights and biases, the activation function, the number of hidden layers and neurons constituting it.\n\nA limitation of NNs are their opaqueness ; even though the weights and biases are known, it is not clear why the network produces the observed results. NNs act like a blackbox, making the results difficult to interpret. The question is to know whether the NN actually understood the concept it had to learn, or if it just memorized the answer. A technique called sensitivity analysis allows to get an idea of what is going on in the network. In a nutshell, it uses the test set to determine how sensitive the output is regarding to each input. To do so, it first finds the average value of each input. Then, it measures the output of the neural network with the averaged inputs. Finally, each input is modified, one at a time, to be at its minimum and maximum values, and the output of the network is calculated. Each input is used with three values; minimum, average and maximum. This method allows assessing the sensitivity of the output regarding the inputs individually.\n\n**backpropagation**\n\nAmong various types of NNs, backpropagation is a classical algorithm used in feedforward neural networks whose purpose is to minimize the error between the value predicted by the network and the desired output by adjusting the weights and biases. Concretely, the algorithm starts by initializing the weights (there are useful techniques such as simulated annealing that help finding good starting points). Then, the inputs and desired outputs (=target) are presented to the network. The network calculates the output based on the weights, biases and activation function. Finally, the algorithm calculates the error and updates the weights recursively. In other words, the error is propagated backwards to optimize the weights.\n\nLet's look at an example to be sure to understand what is happening :"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"![](https://i.imgur.com/WzGdcDx.png)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Here, the weights were randomly initialized in a 0, 1 range for the first iteration (note that the final weights, after optimization, might not be in that interval). First, the product of the inputs with their corresponding weights is calculated and the biases are added :\n\n* 1 x 0.7 + 0.5 x 0.5 = 0.95 + 0.4 = 1.35\n\n* 1 x 0.2 + 0.5 x 0.9 = 0.65 + 0.3 = 0.95\n\n* 1 x 0.3 + 0.5 x 0.8 = 0.7 + 0.8 = 1.5\n\nThen, the transfer function is applied to these values in each neuron. For example, if a sigmoid (defined as y = 1 / (1 + e^-x)) is used, we get the following values :\n\n* S(1.35) = 0.794\n\n* S(0.95) = 0.721\n\n* S(1.5) = 0.818\n\nThis forms the hidden layer results, whose product is summed with the weights linking the hidden layer to the output as follows :\n\n* 0.794 x 0.4 + 0.721 x 0.5 + 0.818 x 0.6 = 1.69\n\nThe output value of the network is obtained by applying a transfer function to this result. In our case, we do not need to apply a function to the output layer because it is a regression problem. The network predicted a value of 1.69, which is compared with the actual value (target), 1.10. As we can see, the output of the first forward propagation depends on the weights and biases that were randomly generated. Therefore, the calculated output can be far from the target value. The backpropagation algorithm allows optimizing these weights and biases to reduce the error between the output and the target values. It minimizes a cost function. For example, if the prediction is *y*, the target is *t* and the metric is the squared error, then the cost function is *J(W) = (y-t)^2*.\n\n**Gradient descent**\n\nGradient descent is an iterative method that optimizes the weights and biases. The idea is to get an idea of the value of the cost function for weights that are close to the current weights by calculating the gradient. Then, the algorithm moves (tries weights) in the direction that minimizes the cost function. This step is repeated several times, until a minima is found.\nOne must be aware that gradient descent might be slow and present the risk of falling in a local minima.\n\nThe steps of gradient descent are the following :\n\n1. Weights *W* are randomly initialized\n2. The network calculates a prediction\n3. The gradients *G* are calculated with respect to the parameters, using partial differentiation. So the value of the gradient depends on the inputs, the weights, the biases and the cost function\n4. The weights are updated by an amount proportional to the gradients ; *W = W - nG*, where *n* is the **learning rate**. This latter determines the size of the steps we take to reach a minimum. It is generally chosen manually, starting with small values such as 0.1, 0.01 or 0.001. We then can adapt it depending on how fast/slow the cost function is reducing. There also exists methods to automatically chose a learning rate, such as **Adam optimizer**, **AdaGrad** and **RMSProp**. In our model, we will use Adam optimizer.\n5. Repeat until the cost function stops reducing or until a predefined criterion is met.\n\nThere are multiple variants of gradient descent defined by the amount of data that is used to calculate the gradient ;\n\n- **Batch gradient descent** : computes the gradient of the cost function for the entire training data. This method can be very slow if the training set contains many observations.\n\n- **Stochastic gradient descent (SGD)** : computes the gradient for each update using a single, randomly chosen data point. This is assumed to be a stochastic approximation of the gradient calculated using batch gradient descent, and is much faster than this latter.\n\n- **Mini-batch gradient descent** : the training set is divided into small batches and the gradient is calculated for each of them. Typically, 30-500 batches are used and one update is made for each of them.\n\nEnough theory, we now have the basics to build a simple neural network model and use it to predict taxi fares ! To do so, we will use the popular Keras API.

The only preprocessing we made before training the model was removing the NAs. The resulting model scored ~9.4, a pretty poor performance.\n\nThen, we saw how to improve this simple model. In particular, we saw the notions of overfitting, cross-validation, regularization (Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2)), hyperparameter tuning and preprocessing of the data. In this latter, weird values for longitude, latitude, fare amount and number of passengers were filtered. Then, a new variable was created, the manhattan distance.  I didn't show all the submissions in the notebook, but it is the creation of this distance variable that really improved the model. This improved linear regression scored ~5.6.\n\nFinally, we saw a basic architecture of neural networks : feedforward neural networks. We also saw what backpropagation and gradient descent are. With a pretty simple setup, and without trying to optimize parameters such as the number of neurons and the transfer function, the model scored ~4.5.\n\nIn this case, the neural network was the best model. However, it is important to think about the problem before trying an algorithm, and not going straight for the most complicated models. While linear regressions can be very effective (both in terms of computation efficiency and accuracy) for linear relationships, more complex models such as NNs are better to capture nonlinear relationships. The downside of NNs are their opaqueness and the computation time.\n\nIn ML, we generally don't know in advance which algorithm will give the best results, and have to try several ones.\n\n**How could we achieve a better score ?**\n\nThere are different ways of increasing this score :\n\n- Use more data : the original training set had ~55'000'000 rows. We only used ~2'000'000\n\n- Feature engineering : do a more in-depth, accurate data preprocessing. For example, create new variables, or select/extract features (with feature selection algorithms such as Lasso for selection or PCA for extraction)\n\n- Optimize this model : try other transfer functions, number of neurons and parameters\n\n- Use another model : one could try decision trees such as random forest, or other type of neural networks. We could also use transfer learning (reusing a model)\n\n- Use ensemble learning methods : combine decisions from multiple models\n\n- ...\n\nAs you see, there are a lot of possibilities... You can try some of these by forking this kernel, or start from fresh on another dataset !\n\nThis concludes this kernel, I hope you had fun and could learn something !

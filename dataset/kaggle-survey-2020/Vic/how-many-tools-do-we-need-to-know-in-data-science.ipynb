And as I get older, the question gradually becomes, \"do I need to learn this as well?\", whenever there is a new trend going on.\n\nTherefore, I wanted to find out from the survey that how many skills or tools (e.g., programming languages) do people know and/or use, and whether and how it relates to job titles, experience, salaray levels, and so on.\n\n## Specific methods:\n### The most important survey question I focused here is\n- *Q7: What programming languages do you use on a regular basis?.*\n\nIn addition, I also looked at two other related questions:\n- *Q9: Which of the following integrated development environments (IDE's) do you use on a regular basis?*\n- *Q14: What data visualization libraries or tools do you use on a regular basis? (Select all that apply)*\n\n** There are other more specific questions regarding cloud computing, database management, etc., but I will stick to the general questions regarding langauges, IDEs, and also visulaization libraries.\n\n### Regarding background information of the responders, I focused on the following 4 questions:\n1. *Q6: For how many years have you been writing code and/or programming?*\n* I found this question particularly interesting becuase, \"do more experience mean more learned hard skills?\", and therefore, \"If one keeps working in the field, does it mean that the person constantly learns more tools?\".\n\n1. *Q5: Select the title most similar to your current role (or most recent title if retired)*\n1. *Q4: What is the highest level of formal education that you have attained or plan to attain within the next 2 years? *\n* However I do not expect this question would be very informative because the variability is probably small, as the majority of the people had high-level education or plan to have. Especially the question included \"plan to attain in 2 years\", which I think made answers to this question noisier and even less informative.\n    \n### At last I also looked at salary level with *Q24: What is your current yearly compensation?*\n\n### Note: In this Notebook I only examined the data from the **US**, as I found that the different countries have quite different patterns and responder compositions, plus other work culture differences among countries, including job titles and salary. Also I believe that the US data alone is also of great interest, since many people on Kaggle outside the US probably consider working in the US as well."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set_style('darkgrid')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"## Read data and selected responders reside in the US\nsurvey = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/kaggle-survey-2020/kaggle_survey_2020_responses.csv')\nquestions = survey.iloc[0, :].T #questions are in first row\nsurvey = survey[survey['Q3'] == 'United States of America']\nn_resp = survey.shape[0]#print(survey.shape)\n\n## For each responder, count how many languages(Q7), IDEs(Q9), and visualization libraries(Q14) they use,\n# And construct a new dataset df_mul \nselected_multiple_choice = ['Q7','Q9','Q14']\n# assign each question a short name for visualization purpose\nselected_multiple_choice_name = ['language','IDE','Vis']\nn_selected_multiple_choice = len(selected_multiple_choice)\nds = np.zeros((n_resp,n_selected_multiple_choice))\nfor iqx, qx in enumerate(selected_multiple_choice):\n    # selected the columns for each multiple-choice\n    targLbl = np.nonzero(np.asarray([qx in q for q in questions.index]))[0]\n    options = questions.values[targLbl]\n    # exclude 'None' answer column:\n    targLbl = np.setdiff1d(targLbl,targLbl[np.nonzero(['None' in option for option in options])])\n    list_of_cols = questions.index[targLbl]#list_of_columns_for_a_single_question\n    #print('#%d %s %s n_opt=%d' % (iqx,qx,selected_multiple_choice_name[iqx],list_of_cols.shape[0]))\n    #if want to examine indvd numbers of each option: \n    #for icol,col in enumerate(list_of_cols): \n    #    print('#%d %s %s nSel=%d' % (icol,col,options[icol].split(' - ')[2],np.sum(survey.iloc[:,targLbl].iloc[:,icol].notna())))\n    ds[:,iqx] = survey.iloc[:,targLbl].notna().sum(axis=1)\n#create a dataframe from the numpy array\ndf_mul = pd.DataFrame(ds,columns=selected_multiple_choice_name,dtype=int, index=survey.index) \ndf_mul","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.

Since 2017 it has conducted an annual survey of the state of Data Science. This notebook will conduct an EDA of the data in the 2020 survey. The focus of this EDA will be on how Data Science varies by country.\n\nPlease leave any feedback in the comments below and upvote if you liked this notebook.\n\nI'm just like you, not wanting to clean these columns up and not having to rewrite all those long column names to obtain data for some of the *multiple-answer* questions. I sat down to write a generic script to work for the 2019 and 2020 survey datasets. \n\nKeeping the notebook, simple and minimal."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Keep nrows=100 to prevent long run times\ndf = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/kaggle-survey-2020/y-2020/kaggle_survey_2020_responses.csv', keep_default_na=False)\n# df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/kaggle-survey-2019/multiple_choice_responses.csv', keep_default_na=False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Before cleaning.

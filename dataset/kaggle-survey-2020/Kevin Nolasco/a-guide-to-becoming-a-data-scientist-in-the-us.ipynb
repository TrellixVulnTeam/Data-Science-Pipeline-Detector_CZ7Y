I was completing my final quarter at the University of California - Santa Barbara as a Mathematical Sciences major and my curiosity for Data Science was growing. Now, I am enrolled in a Masters of Science in Data Science program at Cabrini University and I am hopeful to gain enough experience to finally break into the industry! My goal for this project is to discover the most valuable skills that Data Scientists in the United States have. Specifically, I will be comparing the Data Scientists whose highest degree achieved is bachelor's or master's.

Remember, we filtered our data to contain only responses from USA and Data Scientists that earned a master's or bachelor's degree for their highest degree.\n\n**Programming:**\n* As Data Scientists, we need to program! Most Data Scientists have programmed for about 3-4 years. Start small, make coding fun, and learn from others.\n\n* Python, SQL, or R? Python is a crowd favorite, but the order that you learn these languages in does not matter too much. Flip a coin or learn all at once! If you want to learn Python (the most used programming language among these Data Scientists), I recommend this book: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-for-data/9781119547624/c00.xhtml . You can also try the daily challenges from https://leetcode.com or https://www.hackerrank.com .\n\n**Machine Learning:**\n* I was amazed to see how many of our Data Scientists had less than 1 year of Machine Learning experience. What does that mean for a new Data Scientist? It means that if you start your Machine Learning journey today, you'd be with the majority! Reinforce your Machine Learning knowledge with projects that use Linear/Logistic Regression, Decision Trees/Random Forests, Gradient Boosting Machines, and Bayesian Appoaches.\n\n* Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, and Keras are popular Machine Learning Frameworks. Lucky for us, there is a book for learning all three of these frameworks! Check it out here: https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/ .\n\n**Data Visualization:**\n* Visualizing our data is fun and informative. Get comfortable using matplotlib and seaborn for Python, or ggplot/ggplot2 for R! Confused or stuck? Read the documentation! Also, there is a good chance your issue has been solved by someone already, and you may find the answer to your question at https://stackoverflow.com .\n\n**Share Your Work!:**\n* Whether it is on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, GitHub, Kaggle, or anywhere! Get your work out there and have people see it. This is an opportunity for valuable feedback, so that you can be constantly improving.\n\n**Continue Learning:**\n* There are so many fantastic courses that can help you get started on your Data Science journey! Kaggle has incredible (and free) mini-courses: https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview . A lot of US Data Scientists like Coursera. Personally, I have used edX and completed a Professional Data Science Certificate to get a better understanding of Data Science (check it out here: https://www.edx.org/professional-certificate/harvardx-data-science). \n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Conclusion\n\nThank you Kaggle for hosting this competition!

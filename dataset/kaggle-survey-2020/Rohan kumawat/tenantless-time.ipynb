Don't get **baffled**, we are talking about our not so popular amongst its pals; **The Time Column**.\n\nYou guys might be thinking why time? Well, we were curious to know why hasn't anyone thought of using this column? Was it not enough to provide them insights?\nOr they were not able to come up with any constructive ideas. Even I was one of them, who did not understand what this column is capable of bringing us to the table.\n\nApart from my silly jokes, we all know how tough things were in 2020 for most of us at first. It brought a sense of fear and anxiety around the planet. It has affected every living being. Be it animals or humans with different nationality, level of education, income, or gender. Call it short term or long term, the lockdown has led to psychosocial and mental health implications on most of us.\n\nNearly 81 million jobs were lost during this pandemic period. It’s been around 9 months now that the colleges and schools are shut down. No doubt they are getting a hang of Digital Learning nowadays but for most of the people it’s not the same as physically learning at the campuses. There’s a lot we can add here but the main reason for listing out is so because one question that struck our mind was how did people fill this form in such conditions where many of them were being expelled from their jobs, had no idea about the opening of colleges or school, stuck in different cities and much more. How did they manage to take out time to fill up a survey in such a nerve wrecking year? \nSome saw this pandemic as an opportunity to excel in things which they never couldn't do, that is one of the reasons that the number of participants increased. People were exploring new things on different platforms.\n\nIf I talk about myself, I was quite unsure about how this pandemic would treat me. I realised that this was a Golden opportunity to explore and develop my skills. I got pretty much engaged in learning new domains (From Machine Learning to DevOps to Flutter). \n\nI couldn’t find time to participate in any competition, as one after the other I kept on learning and then the college workload kept on increasing day by day. I saw that Kaggle mailed me to fill up the survey but I probably filled it up after a week or two. This being my very first Kaggle Competition, here’s an approach that I think we might be able to bring something good out of it.\n\nSo here we are, bringing our curious minds to work and try to use every penny of this Time Column."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Episode 2: Data Exploration."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n! pip install --upgrade seaborn\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nfrom plotly.subplots import make_subplots\n\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 20GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"kag20 = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/kaggle-survey-2020/kaggle_survey_2020_responses.csv\")[1:]\nkag20.rename(columns={\"Time from Start to Finish (seconds)\":\"Time\"}, inplace=True)\nkag20[\"Time\"] = kag20[\"Time\"].astype(int)\nkag20[\"Q2\"].replace([\"Prefer to self-describe\", \"Prefer not to say\", \"Nonbinary\"], \"Other\", inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's have a look at how our data actually looks like:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"display(kag20.head())","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Before directly diving into the topic my first and foremost task is to **scrutinize all the null values.**\n\nAccording to my learnings so far, this is the best way for me to find null values.

Since our childhood, we are always taught that Mean is the best way to deal with the “average” of a given dataset or a problem.\n\n**Median:** The median is a value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample. For a dataset, it may be thought of as “the middle” value. Median can also be used as an alternative to the mean.\n\nThe **purpose of the mean or median** is to provide a one-number summary of a set of data. The idea of mean is quite tricky. Think of it as a way of summarising a whole lot of numbers, in order to make comparisons. Median is intrinsically understandable. It is the middle number when the values are put in order.\n\nSo where am I going with this mean-median thing? When both of their purposes are the same, why am I not using Mean? \n\nWell, **the advantage of choosing the Median over the Mean** is that it does not get skewed so much by a small proportion of extremely large or small values. It gives us a better idea of a “typical” value. In normal language, a median is not affected by outliers or it is “resistant” because it is not at the mercy of outliers. **Example:** If you have a median of 5 and then add another observation of 80, the median is unlikely to stray far from the 5.\n\nLet’s look at the data that I’ve been exploring throughout the notebook.

survey,\n* Even though they were faster, the median difference was about 45 seconds between them,\n* The Median outclasses the Mean,\n* The people who filled the form under 100 seconds, we are not considering them to be fast in filling the survey,\n* Amongst the people who filled under 100 seconds, nearly 75% of them were men,\n* Most of the respondents who were of the age group of 60+ years took sufficient time (10 min - 17 min) to complete the survey, \n* According to us, it is possible that they are very experienced, which is why they took sufficient time to fill the survey. At that age, it takes some time to recall all the learnings for answering the particular questions so that might be the reason for the ones who took more than 17 min,\n* The age group of the respondents was directly proportional to the time taken by them to fill the survey considering that there was no sudden drastic change between the counts,\n* On average Nigerians took the most time to complete the form (903 seconds) amongst the other countries and,\n* Belgians took the least time to complete the form (503 seconds), \n* Chinese people, Dutch, and Philippines people share the same average time (594 seconds) despite being big differences between their respondents’ count.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nWe have used the Kaggle 2020 survey to analyze the use of the time column. From the study, we found some insights on how people responded to the survey in a particular range of time intervals. We found out how much time people took to fill the form and its relation with age, gender, degree, and profession. With our research, we found out that the young generation aged from 18-21 were amongst the fastest ones to fill the survey. This could mean that according to our assumptions that either they were not experienced to provide all the answers to the surveyor or they just filled it for some experience. We also observed the median time taken by the respondents to fill up the survey was the highest amongst the bachelor’s degree followed by just a slight decrease in the master’s degree. However, there were many outliers so we suspected that all the ones who completed the form may have either left the survey open or was interrupted in the middle."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Episode 5: The Last One Part 2\n\n### Future Aspects:\n\n* Hunting down the respondents who were either outlier or filled the form in under 150 seconds on a deeper level. \n\n* How the degree, age, time were correlated to each other with a good visualization?  Similarly the relationship between time, profession, and gender; time, profession, degree, etc. \n\n* Finding out deeper insights just like:  the male respondents who were bachelors and having 2-5 years of experience and aged 26-30 years were the ones who filled this form in under 100 seconds.\n\n* Can outliers help us find some beautiful insights?\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# References:\n\n1. https://www.oecd.org/education/the-impact-of-covid-19-on-education-insights-education-at-a-glance-2020.pdf\n2. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7444649/\n3. https://www.ilo.org/asia/media-centre/news/WCMS_763819/lang--en/index.htm\n4. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average\n5. https://creativemaths.net/blog/median/#:~:text=%E2%80%9CHowever%2C%20when%20the%20sample%20size,better%20measure%20of%20central%20tendency.&text=%E2%80%9CUse%20the%20median%20to%20describe,that%20does%20have%20an%20outlier.\n6. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nn9yNoIAL6I"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

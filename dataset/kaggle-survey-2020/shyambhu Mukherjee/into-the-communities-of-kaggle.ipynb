{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Into the forest of kaggle: a datadventure:\n\nMy motivation to write this notebook is really seeing what goes in the large kaggle community. First we will see the data, observe few samples and then form questions which we will try to answer for the rest of the notebook. \nHere are some resources I have used for the project:<br/>\n(1) [50 different matplot plots](https://www.machinelearningplus.com/plots/top-50-matplotlib-visualizations-the-master-plots-python/)<br/>\n(2) [Bar plot with matplotlib](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/matplotlib/matplotlib_bar_plot.htm)<br/>\n(3) [Hexcode color palette for designs](https://digitalsynopsis.com/design/color-schemes-palettes/)<br/>\n\nIn this notebook, we have answered 3 questions yet. <br/>\n#### (1) What is the gender wise distributions? and is that representative enough from world view?<br/>\nAns: We found that although kaggle is heavily male dominated (79%), the representation of LGBTQ+ is somewhat similar to common statistics(0.4%). The relevant plots and calculations can be found inside the notebook [here](#section0).<br/>\n#### (2) what are the country wise distributions of the kagglers? again, is each country proportionately represented in kaggle?\nAns: while we saw that India, china and united states contribute to most numbers of kagglers, both india and united states are in bottom 5 when we consider their number of kagglers as a relative representation from the respective country population. We have plotted and analyzed the relative representation, noted the top 5 and bottom 5. For this, we have taken the help of world population in 2020 data also. Details of this can be found inside the [notebook here](#section1).<br/>\n#### (3) what are the educational backgrounds of the kagglers? What is the programming language preference of the kaggle community and what is the relation of that with their academic background?<br/>\nAns: while this was a rather long analysis and we have generated multiple plots on these, I will mention some highlighted results here. <br/>\n(1) 76% of kagglers come from master's and bachelor's degree; as well as 12% has doctoral degree. This definitely shows a skew of data science towards higher education, while the statistics in kaggle community is similar to other survey data. <br/>\n(2) There is a sharp correlation between programming language choices and academic backgrounds. We can see that R, Julia, Bash and Matlab are the preferred languages for doctorates.<br/>\n(3) Python is mostly used by masters and bachelor degree people. <br/>\n(4) There is a high popularity of sql only in people with professional degrees.<br/>\n(5) People with lower traditional education, tend to use more software languages like swift, C++ and javascript; rather than data science oriented languages like R,python,julia.<br/>\n(6) R and MATLAB are two single highest identifier of increasing education; as both of these have sharp correlation between higher educational degree and usage.<br/>\nCheck the details:<br/>\n(a)[Educational qualification](#section2)<br/>\n(b)[Coding language and educational background](#section3)<br/>\n(c)[Education and coding final insights](#section4)<br/>\n\n#### (4) What are the different business roles kagglers hold? what is the spread of salaries across different business roles and how do they vary across different countries?<br/>\nAns: This is a work in progress question I am exploring, but kagglers hold various roles like data scientist, research scientist, software engineer and others. There is an overall increase in salary as the positions become more data oriented and manager level, but there is a huge influence of geographical location in salaries.<br/>\nWe checked salaries across India, US and china, and noticed that both India and China underpays business roles highly(0-999$ being dominant) while US pays a good sum of money to all roles across the data domain.<br/>\nWe will explore the data more to check if the difference is more on a continent basis.<br/>\nCheck this [business roles and compensation comparison](#section5) part for the detailed analysis.<br/>\nWe explored the roles and their payments in different regions like America, APAC, Africa and europe. Key results in our finding have been that 0-999 dollar is dominant pay in all regions other than america and europe.<br/>\nIn america, people in data intensive roles get paid around 100-150k dollars par annum; while in europe the pay is around 30-60K dollars par annum.<br/>\nIn APAC and Africa, the dominant pay grade other than 0-999 dollar is the 10-15k dollar par annum. This shows the underpayment trend much more clearly. While some may cite the overall economies being much less progressive in some countries of APAC and Africa, more analysis on the same will be needed to confirm that; which is sort of out of scope of ml ds survey.<br/>\nAnother interesting observation I made in this part is that project managers are highest paid roles in both APAC and Africa, while in europe and america data scientists are similarly or higher paid roles in number. This probes a question that whether these two roles mean the same across the different regions in world. We will try to answer this question by analyzing these two roles based on their coding, years of experience and few other features.<br/>\nFor how I came to these derivation, do checkout the notebook! and I hope to answer more questions as I dig deeper in the survey.<br/>\n\n##### This is my first visualization project in kaggle.

the degree wise frequency of languages by the relative frequency of the degrees, we can properly see that which degree relate to which languages more.<br/>\nImportant observations here are:<br/>\n(1) python is more popular with master's and bachelor's degree people.<br/>\n(2) Matlab,bash,Julia and R are the best choices for Doctoral degree. <br/>\n(3) R is less popular with everyone other than Doctoral degree and master's degree people.<br/>\n(4) People with lesser formal education, i.e. people with some college degree but not bachelors and people who have not read after high school are often prone to work with non-scientific languages, like javascript and swift; which are more of web-dev language than data science.<br/> \n(5) people with professional degree and master's degree are among heavy users of sql. SQL is surprisingly not that famous among the other categories. <br/>\n(6) R and MATLAB are languages which are a clear mark of higher education. These have a sharp use increment as we rise through high school, to college, to bachelors, through master to doctoral.

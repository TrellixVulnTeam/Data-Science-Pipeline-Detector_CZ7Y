Research and development in machine learning are expensive, and the intelligence needed to create and train the model is intimidating. Despite these difficulties, some companies are trying to invest in machine learning, because they believe that adopting machine learning lead to bigger competitive advantages. While the other companies are still fear that machine learning is out of reach for them. The degrees of machine learning utilization in the companies are different. Some companies use machine learning for only getting insights from the data and some of them create and deploy machine learning models in production. \n\n\nThis notebook will take us on a journey to **learn about the work environments** that differ in the way of adopting machine learning. We will also get to know the **skills and experiences of the companies' employees**. The notebook will benefit both *people* who want to learn more about the machine learning adoptions in work environments and the *companies* that want to start to use machine learning.\n\n\nThe notebook is organized as the following: it starts with taking a look at the dataset of Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey. Then, we will see how the companies adopt machine learning. After that, we will explore the employees' machine learning experience and skills, and the companies environments."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d01493e9-aa7a-4462-8ca9-59138601fc78","_cell_guid":"a01e85c6-3f4a-4388-bfb7-d13961586c4d","trusted":true},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Let's first take a look at the dataset of Kaggle Machine Learning & Data Science Survey."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.

It is not extensive due to the number of high-quality notebooks already dedicated to this topic (see some links in the **References** section below). Instead of investing more time into analysis of this type, I spent it on analytics in the areas where less attention has been paid by other contest participants (see details in Chapters 3-6  below). \n\nHowever, there are still interesting discoveries found due to research on the multi-variative categorical feature associations (*spoiler*: there is a forecast about when and how *Julia revolution* in Data Science could happen). \n\n**Chapter 3** is concentrated on the organizational environment and job responsibilities of the survey participants. These are\n\n- Size of the employer organization\n- Size of the team working in Data Science-related areas\n- Adoption of ML in the organization\n- Individual job responsibilities of the survey participants\n- Spending on ML and Cloud Computing in the last 5 years\n\nFrom that stand-point, it describes the essential business landscape where kagglers operate on the daily basis.\n\n**Chapter 4** is focused on the preferences of Cloud Computing Provider usage by Kagglers. It draws insights on the popularity of cloud computing platforms and products among the survey participants who are professionals (as opposed to non-professionals - see the note below). In particular, it covers\n\n- Cloud Platforms usage\n- Cloud Computing products usage\n- Cloud ML products usage\n- BigData platforms\n- BI tools (mostly, the cloud-based ones)\n\nThe line of the narrative in this chapter is often attached to the good news and opportunities for the top three cloud service providers in the market as follows\n\n- Amazon Web Services (AWS)\n- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)\n- Microsoft Azure Cloud (MS Azure)\n\n**Chapter 5** is dedicated to the analysis of usage of Data Science automation tools by the survey respondents. In particular, it conveys findings regarding\n\n- the usage of automated machine learning tools\n- the usage of tools to help manage machine learning experiments\n\n**Chapter 6** delves into details about the favorite knowledge sharing and information/knowledge acquisition channels used by the survey participants. In this chapter, we are going to analize the preferences of the survey participants as for\n\n- platforms and tools to publicly share or deploy their data analysis or machine learning applications\n- platforms to take online data science courses\n- primary tools they use to analyze data\n- favorite media sources that report on data science topics\n\n**Chapter 7** provides the geographical perspective on the Kaggle 2020 survey participants. It draws a collection of maps to display by-country distribution of the participants by their demographic data, experience and usage of Cloud Service platforms.\n\n**Appendix** at the end of the notebook contains supplementary notes on\n\n- Methodology and technical implementation details about this notebook\n- Comments on why Rapid EDA tools are not applicable to the EDA in the scope of this project\n- References to the high-quality notebooks of other contest participants that inspired the work done here as well as to the blog posts explaining advanced topics of visualizing relations between categorical features"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install pdpipe","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\nimport datetime as dt\nfrom typing import Tuple\n\nimport pdpipe as pdp\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\nfrom plotly.subplots import make_subplots\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.offline\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Reading Data Into Memory"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# read data\nin_kaggle = True\n\ndef get_data_file_path(is_in_kaggle: bool) -> str:\n    train_path = ''\n    test_path = ''\n\n    if is_in_kaggle:\n        # running in Kaggle, inside the competition\n        data_path = '../input/kaggle-survey-2020/kaggle_survey_2020_responses.csv'\n\n    else:\n        # running locally\n        data_path = 'data/kaggle_survey_2020_responses.csv'\n\n\n    return data_path\n\n# set the size of the geo bubble\ndef set_size(value):\n    '''\n    Takes the numeric value of a parameter to visualize on a map (Plotly Geo-Scatter plot)\n    Returns a number to indicate the size of a bubble for a country which numeric attribute value \n    was supplied as an input\n    '''\n    result = np.log(1+value/1000)\n    if result < 0:\n        result = 0.001\n    return result\n\n# cascatter implementation - reused from https://github.com/myrthings/catscatter/blob/master/catscatter.py\n# (c) Myr BarnÃ©s, 2020\n# More info about this function is available at\n# - https://towardsdatascience.com/visualize-categorical-relationships-with-catscatter-e60cdb164395\n# - https://github.com/myrthings/catscatter/blob/master/README.md\ndef catscatter(df,colx,coly,cols,color=['grey','black'],ratio=10,font='Helvetica',save=False,save_name='Default'):\n    '''\n    Goal: This function create an scatter plot for categorical variables.

Masters of the age of 22-24 \n\nOn top of the population cluster insight above, we can draw the additional intelligence as follows\n\n- People with Bachelor degree predominate in more junior age groups\n- In senior age groups, the percentage of Master and Doctoral degrees grows\n- People with Master degrees predominate in every age group, starting from 25-29 and older.\n- Starting the age group of 35-39 and older, the amount of respondents with Doctoral degrees is only a little less then the respondents with  Master degree for the same age group\n\nBased on the facts/knowledge discoveries above, combined with my onw (quite subjective) 'kaggling' experience, I could formulate a few suggestions regarding better Kaggle community engagement/participation practices. \n\n1. Senior kagglers with Master and Doctoral degrees who crossed the *akme age* line (that is, those who are of the age of 45-49 and older) constitute the 'golden pool' of experts here in Kaggle platform. It could make sense to better engage with them to motivate them to do more knowledge sharing with and possibly other training activities for more junior population of Kagglers.\n2. Ethical standards conduct across various activities on the platform (otherwise known as 'ethical kaggling') could be one of the pillars to keep Senior-level expertswilling to contribute to the body of knowledge here at Kaggle more. Conversly, the lack of 'ethical kaggling' may discourage them from being active on the platform.\n3. Since the majority of Kagglers are quite junior, one of their motivations is to prove their competencies/expertise as well as stand out of the crowd. Some of them are yet to get their heads around the concept of 'ethical kaggling' (see the discussion threads like https://www.kaggle.com/discussion/206639 and similar).\n4. Propaganda and some sort of control of conducting the 'ethical kaggling' practices can be benefitial for the Kaggle community to sustain in the long run. It will also help to better motivate the top senior-level experts to share their knowledge and wisdom with junior generations."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Age-Occupation Relationship"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# aggregate basis cat data for age and gender\nagg_data = data.groupby(['Q1','Q5']).size().reset_index(name='respondent_count')\n\nagg_data = agg_data.rename(\n    columns={\n        'Q1': 'age', \n        'Q5': 'occupation', \n    })","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# this will prevent manifesting a little bug of catscatter \n# casting age and gender to int64 as a result of the catscatter plotting below\nagg_data_copy = agg_data.copy() \n\n\n#plot it\n\ncolors=['blue', 'grey', 'green']\n# create the plot\nplt.figure(figsize=(70,30))\ncatscatter(agg_data_copy , 'age', 'occupation', 'respondent_count', font='Helvetica', color=colors, ratio=10)\n\nplt.xticks(fontsize=40)\nplt.yticks(fontsize=40)\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"fig = px.bar(\n    agg_data, \n    x='age', \n    y='respondent_count', \n    color='occupation', \n    title=\"Kaggle 2020 Survey Respondens by Age and Occupation\", \n    height=600)\nfig.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"As we can see, there are top clusters of the Kaggler survey respondents in the space of Age and Occupation as follows\n\n- Students of the age of 18-21\n- Students of the age of 22-24\n- Students of the age of 25-29\n- Data Scientists of the age of 25-29\n- Data Scientists of the age of 30-34\n\nThe next tier of the responder clusters shows quite a significant amount of young unemployed people (of the age of 22-24 and 25-29, respectively).

Processing and visualising data when there are multiple categorical variables can be tricky.\n\nTherefore I used special visualization instruments that make it easy to \n\n- visualize pair associations between two categorical features (yes, we are not interested in correlations in this case but we rather seek for categories better connected to or associated with each other)\n- visualize multi-variative parallel category relations where more then two categorical features involved\n- visualize tree-like hierarchical relations between arbitrary number of category features (this is extremely powerful when interactions between more then two categorical features are investigated)\n\nSuch instruments are listed below as follows\n\n- catscatter plots\n- parallel category plots (aka alluvial plots)\n- tree map plots\n- stacked bar charts with color coding\n- geoscatter plots to draw by-country data visualizations \n\nFrom the technical implementation stand-point, I used catscatter plot implemented by \nMyr BarnÃ©s (see https://github.com/myrthings/catscatter/blob/master/catscatter.py for more details)\n\nFor the rest of the above-mentioned charts, I used the power, simplisity and interactivity appeal of Plotly (although other visualization libraries exist that can provide similar capabilities)."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Can Rapid EDA Tools Help in This Competition?\n\nDue to the nature of the source data , any of the popular Rapid EDA tools (like *AutoViz*, *SweetViz*, or *Pandas Profiling*) is less then useful for this problem.\n\nMore specifically, the following factors block any attempt to use Rapid EDA tools in a meaningful manner\n\n- sparse data, with multiple columns related to the same domain-area attribute sometimes\n- a lot of categorical features, with the appealing visualization to discover cat-to-cat pair relations and multivariate parallel and hierarchical cat-to-cat relations with more than 2 categorical features to interact"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## References\n\nThis notebook has been inspired by some of the ideas in several great survey EDA contributions per the list below\n\n- https://www.kaggle.com/subinium/kaggle-2020-visualization-analysis\n- https://www.kaggle.com/dwin183287/kagglers-seen-by-continents\n\nAs for the best practices visualizing the associations / relations between categorical variables in your dataset, you may want to review the blog posts below\n\n- https://towardsdatascience.com/processing-and-visualizing-multiple-categorical-variables-with-python-nbas-schedule-challenges-b48453bff813\n- https://towardsdatascience.com/visualize-categorical-relationships-with-catscatter-e60cdb164395\n"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"finish_time = dt.datetime.now()\nelapsed_time =  finish_time - start_time\nprint(\"Finished at \", finish_time)\nprint(\"Elapsed time: \", elapsed_time)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

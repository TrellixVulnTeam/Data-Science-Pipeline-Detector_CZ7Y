Also, on common topics, libraries and tools used for machine learning, and how they publicly share their work and resources used to gain knowledge about current trends.  \n\nThis information can provide insights for both aspiring and experienced data scientists. Some of the questions that can be answered are as follows:\n\n1. What are the popular programming languages, databases, BI tools and IDE's used in this field?\n2. What are some common machine learning algorithms and frameworks to be aware of?\n3. What are the platforms used to learn and share data science work?\n4. What are the tools and frameworks that can be useful to know in that coming future? \n\nNote: These insights are based on the survey responses and limited only to the questions asked in the survey.

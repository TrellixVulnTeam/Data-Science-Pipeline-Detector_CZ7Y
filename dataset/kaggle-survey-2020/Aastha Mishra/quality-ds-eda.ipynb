The main purpose behind choosing this topic in particular is to help out beginners in Data science, being a student I myself have a hard time making simple choices while learning, researching what to choose from the crazy amount of options available. So, I thought it would be a perfect platform to learn from the members of the community by utilizing the little skills I have managed to gain till date. I will get back to the word ‘Quality’ shortly. With experts predicting that 40 zettabytes of data will be in existence by 2020, Data Science career opportunities will only shoot through the roof! This makes data science such an in-demand skill.\n\n‘QUALITY’ DATA SCIENTIST\n\nIn this study I have taken certain factors into account to categorize a person as a ‘Quality Data Scientist’. I would like to highlight the fact that I am not an expert, I am a mere student and the considerations made by me are purely based on what I believe should be considered ideal.\n\n• Select any activities that make up an important part of your role at work (Q23)\n\nI haven’t taken factors like age, education qualification, experience of coding into account as I strongly believe that age is just a number. Different people have different approach towards data science some take specialized degrees while some have no formal education yet come out exceptionally good. Similarly, the effective number of hours a person spends on coding cannot be determined.\n\n• Where do you publicly share or deploy your data analysis or machine learning applications?(Q36)"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Importing Libraries & Loading Data Set"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n%matplotlib inline\nimport seaborn as sns","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df= pd.read_csv(\"../input/kaggle-survey-2020/kaggle_survey_2020_responses.csv\")","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.describe()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df.isnull().sum()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df['Q4'].fillna(value=(df['Q4'].mode()[0]),inplace= True)\ndf['Q23_Part_7'].fillna(value='0',inplace=True)\ndf['Q36_Part_9'].fillna(value='0',inplace=True)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# The Quality Data Scientists"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df1=df[df.Q23_Part_7.str.contains('None of these activities are an important part of my role at work') | df.Q36_Part_9.str.contains('I do not share my work publicly')]\nquality_DS=pd.concat([df,df1]).drop_duplicates(keep=False)\nquality_DS.shape","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"gender=['Man','Women','Prefer not to say','Prefer to self-describe','Nonbinary']\nvalues=quality_DS['Q2'].value_counts()\ncols=['b','m','c','g','r']\nexplode=[0.1,0,0,0,0]\nplt.pie(values,labels=None,colors=cols,explode=explode,shadow=True)\nplt.title('Gender Distribution')\nplt.legend(gender,loc='upper left')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"cleary, we can see that majority of the Quality Data Scientists identify themselves male."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"colour=['crimson','gold','grey','cyan','green','tan','purple','orange','navy','magenta','seagreen','lime','indigo']\nquality_DS['Q1'].value_counts().plot(kind='bar',color=colour)\nplt.title('Age Distribution')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Mostly people between the ages 22-24,18-21,25-29 fall under our created category of quality data scientists.

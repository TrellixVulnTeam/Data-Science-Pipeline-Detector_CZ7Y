While I may use the term *latina*, this may not reflect the identity of the respondent: some may reside in Latin America and not be latina. Also latinas may live in other nations listed, or not, in the survey. Any numeric conclusion here has not been through a proper quantitative analysis, therefore, it is based on the qualitative observations I made. Also, I limited visibility of some dataframes for space.  \n\n**Observation of general survey results**: Participants of the Kaggle 2020 survey were mostly young (25-29) male students from India with Master's degrees and about 3-5 years of experience in coding. According to the survey, participants use Python the most, followed by SQL, R, and C++, and most recommend Python to biginners.      \n\nMost participants identified Jupyter as the integrated development environments (IDE's) they mostly use, and Colab as the hosted-notebook product they mostly use. Kaggle came in second as hosted-notebook. Matplotlib data visualization library is the most used library, and regressions is the most popular Machine Learning algorithm among participants. Interestingly, the majority of participants stated that they have never used a TPU (tensor processing unit).    \n\nRespondents described their place of work or business as one with 1 or 2 people responsible for the data science workload. Most identified *analysis and understanding data* as their most important work role. Most respondents identified Coursera as the platform where they begun learning data scienceand MySQL as the big data product they use the most. Most respondants share publicly share or deploy their data analysis or machine learning applications in GitHub, followed by not sharing, and then in Kaggle. \n\n**Micro-results**: Like the general group, Python, SQL and R are the most popular programming languages among women coders residing in Latin America. They also recommend Python to beginners and identified Jupyter as the most-used integrated development environments (IDE's). They identified Colab as the notebook they use the most, followed by none, and in then Kaggle notebook. The majority of these women also stated to have no experience with TPU, and chose Matplotlib as the library they use the most. \n\nFemale coders residing in Latin America use the Scikit-learn machine learning framework the most. Most of these women said that their employer does not incorporate machine learning in their place of work. Like the group-at-large, they identified the *analysis and understanding of data* as their main workplace role. Among this group of women, Google Cloud Platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Microsoft Azure are the cloud computing platform of choice, in that order. Similar to the overall participants, most of these women prefer to share their projects in GitHub the most. These women identified Coursera as the platform they first learned encountered data science, followed by Udemy and then, Kaggle. Women coders living in Latin America would like to learn MySQL in the near future. \n\n**Conclusion**:The main reason for the pdf-related lines of code was to demonstrate ways to access pdf files when presented with them. I used the overall survey data to explore the overall opinion of participants. I focused on a group of people (women residing in Latin America) to observe and compare their answers to that of the general group. I found no significant difference in their responses, other than the years of experience with coding. Future opportunities include exploring other angles that I did not explore here. Also, a future quantitative analysis and a peer review of this notebook would be ideal.\n "},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Python 3 environment as defined by the kaggle/python Docker \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O \n\n#Obtain competition data\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### **Accessing the data: PDFs in Python**"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#First, install python library for working with PDFs\n!pip install PyPDF2","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Second, import the modules\nimport PyPDF2\n\n#Then, extract text from PDF\n\n#Start by creating a pdf file object for one of the sources\npdfFileObj = open('../input/kaggle-survey-2020/supplementary_data/kaggle_survey_2020_methodology.pdf', 'rb') \n\n# Then, create a pdf reader object \npdfReader = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(pdfFileObj) \n\n# Check the number of pages in the file\nprint(pdfReader.numPages) \n  \n# create a page object \npageObj = pdfReader.getPage(0) \n  \n# extract text from page \nprint(pageObj.extractText()) \n  \n# End by closing the pdf file object \npdfFileObj.close() ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"#Repeat for the other PDF source\n\npdfFileObj2 = open('../input/kaggle-survey-2020/supplementary_data/kaggle_survey_2020_answer_choices.pdf', 'rb') \n# creating a pdf reader object \npdfReader2 = PyPDF2.PdfFileReader(pdfFileObj2) \n\n# number of pages in pdf \nprint(pdfReader2.numPages) \n  \n# creating a page object \npageObj2 = pdfReader.getPage(0) \n  \n# extracting text from page \nprint(pageObj2.extractText()) \n  \n# closing the pdf file object \npdfFileObj2.close() ","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The PDF files may contain more data for exploration (One file has 3 pages and the other 20).

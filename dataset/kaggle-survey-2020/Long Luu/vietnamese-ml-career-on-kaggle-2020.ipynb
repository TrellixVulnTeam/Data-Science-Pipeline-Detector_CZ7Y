Today I will analyze the Kaggle Survey 2020 on Vietnamse.  \nNOTE: all assumptions here about Kagglers/people are all only Vietnamese. I do not mean the general case at all.\n\nSome personal notes before we start about ML in Vietnam:\n- ML/DL or related fields are quite new in Vietnam. Only in the past 3 years that schools/universities start to develop a Data Science learning path.\n- I as a Software Engineering student, is also taught basic ML algorithms, but only up to Perceptron (few nodes of Neural Net).\n- I find very few to no ML textbooks in bookstores.\n- Companies start to grow fast, and they notice the impact of data, so many ML jobs are highly compensated, but in short demand.\n- A proud mention: about 2 (or 3) years ago, Vietnam's first AI research lab VinAI founded, and in 1 year they wrote a paper accepted at ICML! https://www.vinai.io/an-overview-of-icml-2020s-publications/\n\nThese reasons are (but not limited to) motivation that I do this analysis. Kaggle is one of the most well-known ML platforms, so I think I will find interesting things about ML career of Vietnamese here based on the survey."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"#

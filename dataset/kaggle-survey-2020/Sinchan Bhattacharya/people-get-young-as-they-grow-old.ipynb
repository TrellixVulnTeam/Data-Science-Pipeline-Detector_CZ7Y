And time taken represents how focused and quick these Kagglers were and hence we can say - Kagglers get young as they grow old.\n\nLet's explore some takeaways from this small analysis:\n* The high time taken group is 55-69 yrs and they also had a vast variation as well. We can say that they have better things to do than Kaggling (Just kidding)\n* The 50-54 group really stands out in respect to time taken. They break the increasing trend. This Gen X stands out. Kudos 50-54 group, you guys are the Outliers, you will be treated Specially ;)\n* The 22-44 yrs group, the biggest chunk of the Kaggler community, are the most predictable group. They follow a trend simple enough to be predicted by a simple linear regression. I personally like it, since I belong in this group :)\n* 18-21 years group - really proud of this upcoming Gen Z Kagglers !!"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

It shows that, in some cases, it is possible to achieve a reasonably good result without using any machine learning technique, just understanding how each feature is relevant for a given problem.\n\nHowever, this is not the case. By comparing results of 7 different machine learning supervised methods, it was possible to significantly improve results. When combined with PCA, the model could still improve a little.\n\n### Further analysis\n\nI am not sure if this challenge really reflects the real world, at least in the description. It would be nice to check other holidays or important selling dates like Easter, Mother's Day and Vallentine's Day, there might be some more hidden information which could help improve our results.\n\nAnother consideration to make is to isolate each store to create better models. Perhaps the data provided by just one store is not enough to generate a good predictor (because of the lack of information in this case) but maybe isolate stores in the same region (one predictor for each city for example) could be a good idea.\n\n### Improving results?\n\nI just used K-fold for deciding which model I would use to generate my final results. It is possible I would achieve better results if I used an ensemble of Extra Tree Regressors.\n\nOther point here is to search for the best parameters for the chosen model. There may be other settings that could improve this results, both on the Extra Tree Regressor and PCA. \n\nOne last thing to try could be the use of Time Series models, like recurrent neural networks (RNN). As it is clear in the description, an analysis over the time could really generate a good model.\n\n\n\nBest Regards,\nClaudio Santos","execution_count":null}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

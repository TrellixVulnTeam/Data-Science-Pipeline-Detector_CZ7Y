Moreover, Catboost have pre-build metrics to measure the accuracy of the model.\n\nOn official CatBoost [website](https://catboost.ai/#benchmark) you can find the comparison of Catboost with major benchmarks."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Catboost introduces the followign algorithmic advances:\n\n**1. Categorical features support:**\n\nFor data with categorical features the accuracy of CatBoost would be better compared to other algorithms. You do not need to preprocess categorical features (like one-hot encoding), just specify some hyperparameters (will be shown below, we will also use **HP** for hyperparameters).\n\n**2. Better overfitting handling:**\n\nCatBoost uses the implementation of ordered boosting, an alternative to the classic boosting algorithm.  \nFor example, the gradient boosting is quickly overfitted on small datasets. In Catboost there is a special modification for such cases, so on small datasets where other algorithms had a problem of overfitting you won’t observe the same problem with Catboost.\n\n**3. Fast and easy-to-use GPU-training:**\n\nThe versions of CatBoost available from pip install (*pip install catboost*) and conda install (*conda install catboost*) have GPU support out-of-the-box. You just need to specify that you want to train your model on GPU in the corresponding HP (will be shown below).\n\n**4.

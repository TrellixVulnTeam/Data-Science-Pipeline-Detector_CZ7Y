In sklearn, we are required to convert these categories into the numerical format. In order to do this conversion, we use several pre-processing methods like “label encoding”, “one hot encoding” and others.\n\n\nIn this kernel, we will discuss an open sourced library - **CatBoost** developed and contributed by Yandex. CatBoost can use categorical features directly and is scalable in nature.\n\n\nSo, let's get started.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n**If this helped in your learning, then please <font color=\"red\"><b>UPVOTE</b></font>  – because they are the source of motivation!**\n\n\n**Happy learning**\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a class=\"anchor\" id=\"0.1\"></a>\n# **Table of Contents**\n\n1.

Gradient boosting is a powerful machine learning algorithm that is widely applied to multiple types of business challenges like fraud detection, recommendation items, forecasting and it performs well also. It can also return very good results with relatively less data, unlike DL models that need to learn from a massive amount of data.\n\n\n- It is in open-source and can be used by anyone.","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **2. Advantages of CatBoost library** <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"2\"></a>\n\n[Table of Contents](#0.1)\n\n\nAdvantages of CatBoost library are as follows:-\n\n\n- **Performance**: CatBoost provides state of the art results and it is competitive with any leading machine learning algorithm on the performance front.\n\n\n- **Handling Categorical features automatically**: We can use CatBoost without any explicit pre-processing to convert categories into numbers. CatBoost converts categorical values into numbers using various statistics on combinations of categorical features and combinations of categorical and numerical features. \n\n\n- **Robust**: It reduces the need for extensive hyper-parameter tuning and lower the chances of overfitting also which leads to more generalized models. Although, CatBoost has multiple parameters to tune and it contains parameters like the number of trees, learning rate, regularization, tree depth, fold size, bagging temperature and others. \n\n\n- **Easy-to-use**: We can use CatBoost from the command line, using an user-friendly API for both Python and R.\n ","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# **3.

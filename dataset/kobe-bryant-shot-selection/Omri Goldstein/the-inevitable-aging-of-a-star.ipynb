However, in this script I will claim that as a human being and despite his physical superiority, Bryant is not immune to the effect of aging. \n\nI will show that as the years go by, Kobe has increasingly preferred the long distance shot rather than the lay-up, as his amazing athleticism and speed slowly degrade. \n\nWhile this might simply imply an improvement of his style, and maybe in the overall NBA playing style, the fact that his overall field goals went down shows that this was a restriction that was imposed upon him by the inevitable advancement of his biological clock rather than a positive evolution of him as a player.\n\n\n"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"57095030-c245-1646-ef0c-dc868d6653dd"},"source":"# Load Libraries"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"68bec7ff-f6e6-cb14-b913-c70707f7c246"},"outputs":[],"source":"import pandas as pd #the whole data will be stored in a pandas data frame\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt  #for plotting the data\nfrom matplotlib.patches import Circle, Rectangle, Arc\nimport matplotlib\nmatplotlib.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\nimport numpy as np #for numbers handling \n"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"_cell_guid":"4b8ba40b-574c-fd58-f396-e141f0c62667"},"source":"# This Great script for drawing the courst was stolen from MichaelKrueger's excelent script:"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"0a2564c6-4027-772b-ef19-c73412320697"},"outputs":[],"source":"def draw_court(ax=None, color='black', lw=2, outer_lines=False):\n    # If an axes object isn't provided to plot onto, just get current one\n    if ax is None:\n        ax = plt.gca()\n\n    # Create the various parts of an NBA basketball court\n\n    # Create the basketball hoop\n    # Diameter of a hoop is 18\" so it has a radius of 9\", which is a value\n    # 7.5 in our coordinate system\n    hoop = Circle((0, 0), radius=7.5, linewidth=lw, color=color, fill=False)\n\n    # Create backboard\n    backboard = Rectangle((-30, -7.5), 60, -1, linewidth=lw, color=color)\n\n    # The paint\n    # Create the outer box 0f the paint, width=16ft, height=19ft\n    outer_box = Rectangle((-80, -47.5), 160, 190, linewidth=lw, color=color,\n                          fill=False)\n    # Create the inner box of the paint, widt=12ft, height=19ft\n    inner_box = Rectangle((-60, -47.5), 120, 190, linewidth=lw, color=color,\n                          fill=False)\n\n    # Create free throw top arc\n    top_free_throw = Arc((0, 142.5), 120, 120, theta1=0, theta2=180,\n                         linewidth=lw, color=color, fill=False)\n    # Create free throw bottom arc\n    bottom_free_throw = Arc((0, 142.5), 120, 120, theta1=180, theta2=0,\n                            linewidth=lw, color=color, linestyle='dashed')\n    # Restricted Zone, it is an arc with 4ft radius from center of the hoop\n    restricted = Arc((0, 0), 80, 80, theta1=0, theta2=180, linewidth=lw,\n                     color=color)\n\n    # Three point line\n    # Create the side 3pt lines, they are 14ft long before they begin to arc\n    corner_three_a = Rectangle((-220, -47.5), 0, 140, linewidth=lw,\n                               color=color)\n    corner_three_b = Rectangle((220, -47.5), 0, 140, linewidth=lw, color=color)\n    # 3pt arc -

Plot.ly is one of the main products offered by the software company - Plotly which specializes in providing online graphical and statistical visualisations (charts and dashboards) as well as providing an API to a whole rich suite of programming languages and tools such as Python, R, Matlab, Node.js etc.\n\nListed below for easy convenience are links to the various Plotly plots in this notebook:\n\n1. Simple horizontal bar plot - Used to inspect the Target variable distribution\n2. Correlation Heatmap plot - Inspect the correlation between the different features\n3. Scatter plot - Compare the feature importances generated by Random Forest and Gradient-Boosted model\n4. Vertical bar plot - List in Descending order, the importance of the various features\n5. 3D Scatter plot\n\nThe themes in this notebook can be briefly summarized follows:\n\n1. Data Quality Checks : Visualising and evaluating all missing/Null values (values that are -1)\n\n2. Feature inspection and filtering : Correlation and feature Mutual information plots against the target variable. Inspection of the Binary, categorical and other variables.\n\n3.

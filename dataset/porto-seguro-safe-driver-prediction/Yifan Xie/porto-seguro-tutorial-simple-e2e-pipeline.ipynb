Categorical features encoding\n\nCategorical features in this dataset are encoded in a numeric manner, i.e. we have '0', '1', '2' representing different classes of some car related concepts like 'FWD', 'RWD', '4WD' for drive types. It is a nice way to represent information that is not in numeric format - since most ML algorthims prefer number over string. \n\nThis does present a problem, as you can imagine, there isn't necessary a logical order to rank different drive types from 'FF' to '4DW in an ordinal manner i.e. '0','1','2'.  Now that we encoding them in such a way, we have actually manually imposed such an ordinal logic which doesn't necessary exist within the observations.\n\nLet's apply some tricks present them in a non-ordinal way, here we are going to use \"frequency encoding\" and \"binary encoding\"\n\n## 2.1 Frequency Encoding\n\nThe idea behind frequency encoding is to represent the levels within a categorical features with the frequency they are observe in a dataset. One of the reaons of doing this is more frequently observed level often behave in a similar way - but this is not always true. In the end we need our cross-validation effort to tell us if this is indeed helpful. \n\nAnyway, let's build a utility function to do this:","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"outputs":[],"source":"# This function late in a list of features 'cols' from train and test dataset, \n# and performing frequency encoding. \ndef freq_encoding(cols, train_df, test_df):\n    # we are going to store our new dataset in these two resulting datasets\n    result_train_df=pd.DataFrame()\n    result_test_df=pd.DataFrame()\n    \n    # loop through each feature column to do this\n    for col in cols:\n        \n        # capture the frequency of a feature in the training set in the form of a dataframe\n        col_freq=col+'_freq'\n        freq=train_df[col].value_counts()\n        freq=pd.DataFrame(freq)\n        freq.reset_index(inplace=True)\n        freq.columns=[[col,col_freq]]\n\n        # merge ths 'freq' datafarme with the train data\n        temp_train_df=pd.merge(train_df[[col]], freq, how='left', on=col)\n        temp_train_df.drop([col], axis=1, inplace=True)\n\n        # merge this 'freq' dataframe with the test data\n        temp_test_df=pd.merge(test_df[[col]], freq, how='left', on=col)\n        temp_test_df.drop([col], axis=1, inplace=True)\n\n        # if certain levels in the test dataset is not observed in the train dataset, \n        # we assign frequency of zero to them\n        temp_test_df.fillna(0, inplace=True)\n        temp_test_df[col_freq]=temp_test_df[col_freq].astype(np.int32)\n\n        if result_train_df.shape[0]==0:\n            result_train_df=temp_train_df\n            result_test_df=temp_test_df\n        else:\n            result_train_df=pd.concat([result_train_df, temp_train_df],axis=1)\n            result_test_df=pd.concat([result_test_df, temp_test_df],axis=1)\n    \n    return result_train_df, result_test_df\n","metadata":{"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","execution_count":5},{"source":"let's apply this function on some of our categorical features:","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"outputs":[],"source":"cat_cols=['ps_ind_02_cat','ps_car_04_cat', 'ps_car_09_cat',\n          'ps_ind_05_cat', 'ps_car_01_cat', 'ps_car_11_cat']\n\n# generate dataframe for frequency features for the train and test dataset\ntrain_freq, test_freq=freq_encoding(cat_cols, train, test)\n\n# merge them into the original train and test dataset\ntrain=pd.concat([train, train_freq], axis=1)\ntest=pd.concat([test,test_freq], axis=1)","metadata":{"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","execution_count":6},{"source":"Let's have a look at one of the frequency feature and compare to the original feature:","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"outputs":[],"source":"train[train.columns[train.columns.str.contains('ps_ind_02_cat')]].head(5)","metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","execution_count":7},{"source":"As you can see they a frequency value is now assigned to different level for the feature 'ps_ind_02_cat' - we shall remove the original feature after this transformation, but we still want to apply binary encoding before doing so.\n\n## 2.2 Binary Encoding\n\nOne of the most demonstrated effort for categorical encoding is so care \"one-hot-encoding\", in which case you create a vector of 0s for each level, and simply assign a 1 to replace the nth 0 for the nth level. So for instance for the drive type example we used above: \"FWD\", \"RWD and \"4WD\", we would represent \"FWD\" with 100, \"RWD\" 010, and \"4WD\" with 001.\n\nIt is good idea to represent information in this way, in that it remove the unwanted ordinal pattern in 0, 1 and 2. But now we introduce an issue of dimensitionaity - we are now using n \"dummy columns\" to represent an original columns with n levels.  For a feature with 3 levels we might be ok, but for a feature like \"ps_car_11_cat\" are are introducing 100+ column into a original data set with 50 columns. By doing this we more than triple the size of the dataset, and this spells trouble for machine learning due to [*\"the curse of dimensionality\"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality)\n\nBinary Encoding, as describe by this cool article [*\"Beyond One-Hot\"*](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2015/12/beyond-one-hot-exploration-categorical-variables.html) from KDnuggets, is an approach that allow you to use less \"dummy columns\" and yet remove the ordinal pattern from numeric encoding. The idea is to represent already numeric encoded levels from categorical features using their binary representation. So for a feature with 4 levels 0, 1, 2, 3: 0 will be encoded as \"00\", 1 will be encoded as \"01\", 2 will be encoded as \"10\" and 3 will be encoded as \"11\". \n\nLet's put this into action, and create a utility function for ","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"outputs":[],"source":"# perform binary encoding for categorical variable\n# this function take in a pair of train and test data set, and the feature that need to be encode.\n# it returns the two dataset with input feature encoded in binary representation\n# this function assumpt that the feature to be encoded is already been encoded in a numeric manner \n# ranging from 0 to n-1 (n = number of levels in the feature). \n\ndef binary_encoding(train_df, test_df, feat):\n    # calculate the highest numerical value used for numeric encoding\n    train_feat_max = train_df[feat].max()\n    test_feat_max = test_df[feat].max()\n    if train_feat_max > test_feat_max:\n        feat_max = train_feat_max\n    else:\n        feat_max = test_feat_max\n        \n    # use the value of feat_max+1 to represent missing value\n    train_df.loc[train_df[feat] == -1, feat] = feat_max + 1\n    test_df.loc[test_df[feat] == -1, feat] = feat_max + 1\n    \n    # create a union set of all possible values of the feature\n    union_val = np.union1d(train_df[feat].unique(), test_df[feat].unique())\n\n    # extract the highest value from from the feature in decimal format.\n    max_dec = union_val.max()\n    \n    # work out how the ammount of digtis required to be represent max_dev in binary representation\n    max_bin_len = len(\"{0:b}\".format(max_dec))\n    index = np.arange(len(union_val))\n    columns = list([feat])\n    \n    # create a binary encoding feature dataframe to capture all the levels for the feature\n    bin_df = pd.DataFrame(index=index, columns=columns)\n    bin_df[feat] = union_val\n    \n    # capture the binary representation for each level of the feature \n    feat_bin = bin_df[feat].apply(lambda x: \"{0:b}\".format(x).zfill(max_bin_len))\n    \n    # split the binary representation into different bit of digits \n    splitted = feat_bin.apply(lambda x: pd.Series(list(x)).astype(np.uint8))\n    splitted.columns = [feat + '_bin_' + str(x) for x in splitted.columns]\n    bin_df = bin_df.join(splitted)\n    \n    # merge the binary feature encoding dataframe with the train and test dataset - Done! \n    train_df = pd.merge(train_df, bin_df, how='left', on=[feat])\n    test_df = pd.merge(test_df, bin_df, how='left', on=[feat])\n    return train_df, test_df\n","metadata":{"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","execution_count":8},{"source":"Let's try this out!","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"outputs":[],"source":"cat_cols=['ps_ind_02_cat','ps_car_04_cat', 'ps_car_09_cat',\n          'ps_ind_05_cat', 'ps_car_01_cat']\n\ntrain, test=binary_encoding(train, test, 'ps_ind_02_cat')\ntrain, test=binary_encoding(train, test, 'ps_car_04_cat')\ntrain, test=binary_encoding(train, test, 'ps_car_09_cat')\ntrain, test=binary_encoding(train, test, 'ps_ind_05_cat')\ntrain, test=binary_encoding(train, test, 'ps_car_01_cat')","metadata":{"collapsed":true},"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9},{"source":"let's have a look at now all the columns with 'ps_ind_02_cat', you can now see how the binary encodeing features are created now for 'ps_ind_02_cat'","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown"},{"outputs":[],"source":"train[train.columns[train.columns.str.contains('ps_ind_02_cat')]].head(5)\n","metadata":{},"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10},{"source":"Those of you with a sharp eye will notice that we didn't perform binary encoding for the feature 'ps_car_11_cat' - a categorical feature with more than 100 levels.

For data sets with many more variables this could reduce the processing time. \n\nSklearn also comes with other feature selection methods. One of these methods is SelectFromModel in which you let another classifier select the best features and continue with these. Below I'll show you how to do that with a Random Forest. \n\n**Selecting features with a Random Forest and SelectFromModel**\n\nHere we'll base feature selection on the feature importances of a random forest. With Sklarn's SelectFromModel you can then specify how many variables you want to keep. You can set a threshold on the level of feature importance manually. But we'll simply select the top 50% best variables. \n\nThe code in the cell below is borrowed from the GitHub repo of Sebastian Raschka. This repo contains code samples of his book Python Machine Learning, which is an absolue must to read.

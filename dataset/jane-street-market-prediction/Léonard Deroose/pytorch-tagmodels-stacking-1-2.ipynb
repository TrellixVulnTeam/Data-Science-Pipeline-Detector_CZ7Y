Electronic trading allows for thousands of transactions to occur within a fraction of a second, resulting in nearly unlimited opportunities to potentially find and take advantage of price differences in real time.\nIn a perfectly efficient market, buyers and sellers would have all the agency and information needed to make rational trading decisions. As a result, products would always remain at their “fair values” and never be undervalued or overpriced. However, financial markets are not perfectly efficient in the real world.\nDeveloping trading strategies to identify and take advantage of inefficiencies is challenging. Even if a strategy is profitable now, it may not be in the future, and market volatility makes it impossible to predict the profitability of any given trade with certainty. As a result, it can be hard to distinguish good luck from having made a good trading decision.\nIn the first three months of this challenge, you will build your own quantitative trading model to maximize returns using market data from a major global stock exchange. Next, you’ll test the predictiveness of your models against future market returns and receive feedback on the leaderboard.\nYour challenge will be to use the historical data, mathematical tools, and technological tools at your disposal to create a model that gets as close to certainty as possible. You will be presented with a number of potential trading opportunities, which your model must choose whether to accept or reject.\nIn general, if one is able to generate a highly predictive model which selects the right trades to execute, they would also be playing an important role in sending the market signals that push prices closer to “fair” values. That is, a better model will mean the market will be more efficient going forward. However, developing good models will be challenging for many reasons, including a very low signal-to-noise ratio, potential redundancy, strong feature correlation, and difficulty of coming up with a proper mathematical formulation.\nJane Street has spent decades developing their own trading models and machine learning solutions to identify profitable opportunities and quickly decide whether to execute trades. These models help Jane Street trade thousands of financial products each day across 200 trading venues around the world.\nAdmittedly, this challenge far oversimplifies the depth of the quantitative problems Jane Streeters work on daily, and Jane Street is happy with the performance of its existing trading model for this particular question. However, there’s nothing like a good puzzle, and this challenge will hopefully serve as a fun introduction to a type of data science problem that a Jane Streeter might tackle on a daily basis. Jane Street looks forward to seeing the new and creative approaches the Kaggle community will take to solve this trading challenge."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Data Description**\n\nThis dataset contains an anonymized set of features, feature_{0...129}, representing real stock market data. Each row in the dataset represents a trading opportunity, for which you will be predicting an action value: 1 to make the trade and 0 to pass on it. Each trade has an associated weight and resp, which together represents a return on the trade. The date column is an integer which represents the day of the trade, while ts_id represents a time ordering. In addition to anonymized feature values, you are provided with metadata about the features in features.csv.\n\nIn the training set, train.csv, you are provided a resp value, as well as several other resp_{1,2,3,4} values that represent returns over different time horizons. These variables are not included in the test set. Trades with weight = 0 were intentionally included in the dataset for completeness, although such trades will not contribute towards the scoring evaluation.\n\nThis is a code competition that relies on a time-series API to ensure models do not peek forward in time. To use the API, follow the instructions on the Evaluation page. When you submit your notebook, it will be rerun on an unseen test:\n\n    During the model training phase of the competition, this unseen test set is comprised of approximately 1 million rows of historical data.\n    During the live forecasting phase, the test set will use periodically updated live market data.\n\nNote that during the second (forecasting) phase of the competition, the notebook time limits will scale with the number of trades presented in the test set. Refer to the Code Requirements for details.\nFiles\n\n    train.csv - the training set, contains historical data and returns\n    example_test.csv - a mock test set which represents the structure of the unseen test set. You will not be directly using the test set or sample submission in this competition, as the time-series API will get/set the test set and predictions.\n    example_sample_submission.csv - a mock sample submission file in the correct format\n    features.csv - metadata pertaining to the anonymized features\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"**Evaluation**\n\nThis competition is evaluated on a utility score.

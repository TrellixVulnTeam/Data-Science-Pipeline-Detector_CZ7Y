(We don't know if they are actually stocks but it's probably clearer than 'underlyings'). Isolating one stock in one given day we can give a hard look at all the available features, without being parasited by the other stocks.\n\nThere seems to be multiple main results in this notebook:\n- Once you isolate one stock some time series start to appear, allowing us to use a whole lot of new tools\n- Most features seems to be redundant in a way or another at the daily x stock level (It is still a bit unclear as to why they are not at a higher level)\n- Some features exhibit very weird patterns so that we should be able to devellop some original engineered features\n\nThe main drawback of this approach is that we have 500 days and around 700 'stocks' a day. So the conclusions we might draw from one stock over one day might not hold, especially if we do our exploration work on underlyings with higher number of opportunities... This notebooks might require a lot of additional work to explore the data set. (Well to be honest this is the main reason why I share the notebook: I can't possibly explore everything by myself, so I hope some of you will try it on other stocks / days and share their findings).\n\nOnce you have read the notebook feel free to fork it and run it for another stock or another day and share your results if they are significantly different. And if you don't want to, that's ok as long as you don't forget to upvote ðŸ˜œ.

If we undertsand them we might be able to build better features, then get better scores. \nI am specifficaly intrigued by the multiples 'lines' we can see above. How would they matter ? are the difference between consecutives values informatives ? or are they some artefact of an anonymisation process ? It seems that when changing the day / stock we get different lines. What info lies in the evolution of the form of the lines trough the days ?\n\nI think we should probably start by looking at other days and stocks. Feel free to pick a day at random, some common stock and look if the relationships holds.","metadata":{}}]}

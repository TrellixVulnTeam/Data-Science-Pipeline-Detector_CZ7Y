In a perfectly efficient market, buyers and sellers would have all the agency and information needed to make rational trading decisions. \n\nIn reality, financial markets are not efficient. The purpose of this trading model is to identify arbitrage opportunities to \"buy low and sell high\". In other words, we exploit market inefficiencies to identify and decide whether to execute profitable trades.\n\nThe dataset, provided by Jane Street, contains an anonymized set of 129 features representing real stock market data. Each row in the dataset represents a trading opportunity, for which I predict an action value: 1 to make the trade and 0 to pass on it. Due to the high dimensionality of the dataset, I use Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to identify features to be used for supervised learning. The intuition is to compress the dataset and use it more efficiently. I then use XGBoost (extreme gradient boosting) - a hugely popular ML library due to its superior execution speed and model performance - to predict profitable trades. I also use Optuna (an automatic hyperparameter optimization software framework) to tune the hyperparameters of the classification model.\n\nPlease upvote if you find this notebook helpful! ðŸ˜Š Thank you! I would also be very happy to receive feedback on my work."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 1) Import important libraries and

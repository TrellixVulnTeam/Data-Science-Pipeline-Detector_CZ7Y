{"cells":[{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Data Description\n\nThis dataset contains an anonymized set of features, feature_{0...129}, representing real stock market data. Each row in the dataset represents a trading opportunity, for which you will be predicting an action value: 1 to make the trade and 0 to pass on it. Each trade has an associated weight and resp, which together represents a return on the trade. The date column is an integer which represents the day of the trade, while ts_id represents a time ordering. In addition to anonymized feature values, you are provided with metadata about the features in features.csv.\n\nIn the training set, train.csv, you are provided a resp value, as well as several other resp_{1,2,3,4} values that represent returns over different time horizons. These variables are not included in the test set. Trades with weight = 0 were intentionally included in the dataset for completeness, although such trades will not contribute towards the scoring evaluation."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\nFor extensive data analysis for the jane street market dataset go to following link [EDA-Quantitative-Researcher-prespective](https://www.kaggle.com/huzzefakhan/eda-quantitative-researcher-prespective) this notebook will go through the train and features csv's for an extensive exploratory data analysis, Also some data cleaning and preprocessing will be done along the way. In this note book I use XG boot to identify features to be used for supervised learning. This is first version of modeling i am also tring to add some finding from my EDA in this modeling exercise.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## About me\n\nWorking as Data Scientist in IT firm in Pakistan. I was Recently Enguaged with Radix Trading LLC which is a firm just like Jane Street which also work in High frequency algorithmic trading. Where i worked as Quantitative Researcher (Quant) to Capture Price movement in High frequency Algorithmic trading through Alphas. Designed many successful Alpha/strategies which is trade-able in real Stock market.

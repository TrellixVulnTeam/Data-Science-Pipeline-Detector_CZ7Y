These sets also show shared relationships to feature_0. \n3. If you look closely, the internal structure of the corrlations between features 7-16 and 17-26 follows similar patterns. For example feature_7 is more correlated to feature_11 than feature_9. Following the same pattern, feature_17 is more correlated to feature_21 than feature_19. Such patterns are consistent between the ranges 7-16, 17-26, and 27-36.\n4. Partial speculation. Features 3 to 36 are all closely related.

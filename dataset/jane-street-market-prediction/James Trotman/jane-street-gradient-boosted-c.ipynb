a deeper tree may require more feature tests on average.\nBut `m2cgen` works with XGBoost and all those other `sklearn` models.\n\nIt's a very easy step to add to the end of your training Notebook, save an `.so` library as an extra output.\nBut it is also flexible: if you save the model as text or a pickle it's possible to \"transpile\" to a language like C later.\n\n### Alternate Uses\n\nEven if you don't want the added complexity of this in your submission code, it might be useful for faster predictions when doing permutation testing (shuffle one column of validation data at a time, make predictions and track the validation metrics to see how important each feature is).\n\nAs mentioned in the [Hacker News thread][1] - super light-weight, dependency free deployment of real systems.\n\n\n### Alternatives\n\nLightGBM has a [convert_model][3] command line option which supports \"cpp\".\n\nSomeone listed other options from that same [Hacker News thread][1]:\n\n> <em><b>jononor</b> on Mar 5, 2019 [–]</em>\n> \n> Other similar projects:\n> \n> https://github.com/nok/sklearn-porter Supports many scikit-learn models to Java/C/JavaScript/Go/Ruby, at least since 2016.\n> \n> https://github.com/konstantint/SKompiler transpiles to Excel/SQL\n> \n> https://github.com/jonnor/emlearn To C only, focus on microcontrollers/embedded devices.

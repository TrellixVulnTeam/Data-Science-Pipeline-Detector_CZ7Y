More info on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharpe_ratio)\nand some discussions on this topic [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jane-street-market-prediction/discussion/199107).\n\nThe factor t is a measure of the riskiness of the investment actions. Low $t$ means high variance, which implies high risk. \nSo it makes sense that for strategies with the same return $\\sum p_i$, the one with the highest $t$ (i.e. lowest risk) gets the better score. \n\nI have no idea why there is a cutoff at $t > 6$. \nMaybe it represents such a low level of variance that the implied risk becomes negligible to other risk factors that are beyond the scope of this competition.

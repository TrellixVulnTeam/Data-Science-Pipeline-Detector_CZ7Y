That is, a better model will mean the market will be more efficient going forward. However, developing good models will be challenging for many reasons, including a very low signal-to-noise ratio, potential redundancy, strong feature correlation, and difficulty of coming up with a proper mathematical formulation. This is a Code Competition and you need to submit notebooks for evaluation.\n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## <a name=\"dataset_description\"> Mission of this Kernal </a>: \n\nThis kernal dive into more details on model interpretability and help to understand the featues interaction with target variables , It greatly helps in feature engineering "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## <a name=\"dataset_description\">Dataset Description</a>: \n\n\nThis dataset contains an anonymized set of features, feature_{0...129}, representing real stock market data. Each row in the dataset represents a trading opportunity, for which you will be predicting an action value: 1 to make the trade and 0 to pass on it. Each trade has an associated weight and resp, which together represents a return on the trade. The date column is an integer which represents the day of the trade, while ts_id represents a time ordering. In addition to anonymized feature values, you are provided with metadata about the features in features.csv.\n\nIn the training set, train.csv, you are provided a resp value, as well as several other resp_{1,2,3,4} values that represent returns over different time horizons. These variables are not included in the test set. Trades with weight = 0 were intentionally included in the dataset for completeness, although such trades will not contribute towards the scoring evaluation.\n\nThis is a code competition that relies on a time-series API to ensure models do not peek forward in time. To use the API, follow the instructions on the Evaluation page. When you submit your notebook, it will be rerun on an unseen test:\n\nDuring the model training phase of the competition, this unseen test set is comprised of approximately 1 million rows of historical data.\nDuring the live forecasting phase, the test set will use periodically updated live market data.\nNote that during the second (forecasting) phase of the competition, the notebook time limits will scale with the number of trades presented in the test set. Refer to the Code Requirements for details.\n\nFiles\n1. train.csv - the training set, contains historical data and returns\n2. example_test.csv - a mock test set which represents the structure of the unseen test set. You will not be directly using the test set or sample submission in this competition, as the time-series API will get/set the test set and predictions.\n3. example_sample_submission.csv - a mock sample submission file in the correct format\n4. features.csv - metadata pertaining to the anonymized features\n\n   "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Evaluation metrics \n\n\nThis competition is evaluated on a utility score. Each row in the test set represents a trading opportunity for which you will be predicting an action value, 1 to make the trade and 0 to pass on it. Each trade j has an associated weight and resp, which represents a return.\n\nFor each date i, we define: p_i = \\sumj(weight{ij} resp_{ij} action_{ij})\n\nt = \\frac{\\sum p_i }{\\sqrt{\\sum p_i^2}} * \\sqrt{\\frac{250}{|i|}}\n\nwhere |i| is the number of unique dates in the test set.

Loading 5+ GB of data into pandas on Kaggle's docker image is slow... who has time for that?\nA fast way to get data into pandas is to **load a pickle file**. This is a starter notebook to pickle the train.csv data for use in subsequent notebooks.\n\nTo load the JS train.csv using pickle from any notebook,\n\n1. Save and Run All (Commit) this notebook\n1. Open your other janestreet competition notebook\n1. Click \"Add Data\" > \"Notebook Output Files\" > \"Your Work\"\n1. Click the \"Add\" button on the \"pickling\" notebook\n1. Use this code to load the janestreet train.csv as a pandas dataframe:\n\n\n```\nimport pickle\nimport pandas as pd\ntrain_pickle_file = '/kaggle/input/pickling/train.csv.pandas.pickle'\ntrain = pickle.load(open(train_pickle_file, 'rb'))\n```"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"%%time\nimport pickle\nimport pandas as pd\nimport datatable as dt\n\ntrain_file = '/kaggle/input/jane-street-market-prediction/train.csv'\npickle.dump(dt.fread(train_file).to_pandas(), open('train.csv.pandas.pickle', 'wb'))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Speed Comparison"},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Uncomment and run the below to check load times\n\n#%time train = dt.fread('/kaggle/input/jane-street-market-prediction/train.csv').to_pandas()\n#%time train1 = pickle.load(open('train.csv.pandas.pickle', 'rb'))\n#print('Dataframes are equal: ' + str(train.equals(train1)))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

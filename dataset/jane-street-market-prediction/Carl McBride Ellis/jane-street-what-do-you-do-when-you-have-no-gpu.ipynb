It has been mentioned that Jane Street processes [around 2.3TB of market data every day](https://blog.janestreet.com/real-world-machine-learning-part-1/), so speed is of the essence. I would not be at all surprised if that in reality when it comes to high-frequency trading, where transactions may be undertaken in less than 1 millisecond, a simple algorithm somewhat more akin to this one is actually used on a *day-to-day* basis."}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

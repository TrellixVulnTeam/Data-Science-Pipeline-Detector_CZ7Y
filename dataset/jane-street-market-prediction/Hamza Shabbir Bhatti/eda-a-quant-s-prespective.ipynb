Each row in the dataset represents a trading opportunity, for which you will be predicting an action value: 1 to make the trade and 0 to pass on it. Each trade has an associated weight and resp, which together represents a return on the trade. The date column is an integer which represents the day of the trade, while ts_id represents a time ordering. In addition to anonymized feature values, you are provided with metadata about the features in features.csv.\n\nIn the training set, train.csv, you are provided a resp value, as well as several other resp_{1,2,3,4} values that represent returns over different time horizons. These variables are not included in the test set. Trades with weight = 0 were intentionally included in the dataset for completeness, although such trades will not contribute towards the scoring evaluation.\n\nThis is a code competition that relies on a time-series API to ensure models do not peek forward in time. To use the API, follow the instructions on the Evaluation page. When you submit your notebook, it will be rerun on an unseen test:\n\n   - During the model training phase of the competition, this unseen test set is comprised of approximately 1 million rows of historical data.\n   - During the live forecasting phase, the test set will use periodically updated live market data.\n\nNote that during the second (forecasting) phase of the competition, the notebook time limits will scale with the number of trades presented in the test set. Refer to the Code Requirements for details."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# About me\n   - i am Data Scientist in one of leading IT firms in Pakistan.

Last 10 features have same strong correlation patterns as first 6 have in between them.\n\n* Features with Postive Relation with Resp value tend to have Higer R2 Score than Features with Negative Relation for example features 30 and 40 have Highest **R2 Score** in The Groups that i have explored.\n* Group Tag 6 have Highest Number of features as well Highest Number of R2 score i have seen in any other Group. **This Validates my Hypothsis about High Significance of the features that are present in this Group**.\n\n* **Postive Relation and Higher R2 Score Between Resp and features indicates that these features can better explain the Resp Value Behaviour**\n* **Features 41 ,42 and 43 have Different Distribution than any other feature.This means that they have been created from one similar idea/concept.**\n* **Features in  Tag 18,19,20,21,22,28 and Tag 17 have lower values of R2 Score than any other group that i have explored. This can be due to high Skewness and kurtosis that is present in these features. Some of features have bimodel distribution instead of Normal distribution.These might be reasons of low  R2 score of these features.**\n\n> Let me know your findings about this data in comment section below :) "},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# References\n[1] [Stackoverflow - How to plot multiple Seaborn Jointplot in Subplot ?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35042255/how-to-plot-multiple-seaborn-jointplot-in-subplot)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

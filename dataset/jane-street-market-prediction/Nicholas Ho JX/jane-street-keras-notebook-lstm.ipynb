The Jane Street Market Prediction competition challenges us to create a quantitative trading model, one that utilizes real-time market data to help make trading decisions and maximise returns.\n\n### Framing the Problem\n\nThe goal of the model is to **predict whether it is better to make a trade or pass on it** at a certain point in time, given an anonymized set of features representing stock market data at that point.\n\nI opted to use a **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** model because market data is a Time Series. Analysing past patterns to predict future performance is already established in Fundamental market analysis, so I decided to have the model take into account past data in addition to current data.\n\nBelow, I go through the preparation of data, model creation and finally prediction."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## 1.

Notes and Observations\n\nDespite my initial optimism that an LSTM will be an improvement over simply using a standard multi-layer perceptron (MLP), the model did not perform well. The AUC-ROC was very close to 0.5, indicating that the model had little to no distinguishing power, even on the training data. The accuracy was also low, hovering around 15-20%.\n\nThe poor performance might be due to the very short time between each data point. A lookback of 10, 50 or even 100 will only retain data from a short period of time into the past. In contrast, Fundamental Analysis tends to look at data going back hours, days or weeks. With such a short lookback, the data is also likely very noisy.\n\nThis LSTM approach was also much more resource-intensive than simpler approaches, due to the windowing of the data increasing the size of the data processed by a factor of the lookback value and the complexity of an LSTM model relative to a MLP. This limited the amount of tuning and epochs I could run due to Kaggle Notebooks' computing limitations.\n \nUltimately, I conclude that the model, as it is, is ill-suited for this problem."},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### References:\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/carlmcbrideellis/jane-street-eda-of-day-0-and-feature-importance\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/tomwarrens/nan-values-depending-on-time-of-day\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/manavtrivedi/lstm-rnn-classifier\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/rajkumarl/jane-tf-keras-lstm\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/tarlannazarov/own-jane-street-with-keras-nn"}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}

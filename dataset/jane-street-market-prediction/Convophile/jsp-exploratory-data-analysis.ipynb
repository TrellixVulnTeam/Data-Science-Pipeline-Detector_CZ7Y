Electronic trading allows for thousands of transactions to occur within a fraction of a second, resulting in nearly unlimited opportunities to potentially find and take advantage of price differences in real time.\n- In a perfectly efficient market, buyers and sellers would have all the agency and information needed to make rational trading decisions. As a result, products would always remain at their ‚Äúfair values‚Äù and never be undervalued or overpriced. However, financial markets are not perfectly efficient in the real world for a number of reasons.\n- Even if a strategy is profitable now, it may not be in the future, and market volatility makes it impossible to predict the profitability of any given trade with certainty. As a result, it can be hard to distinguish good luck from having made a good trading decision. \n\n### 1.3 General Information about Electronic Trading.\n- [Electronic Trading](https://capital.com/electronic-trading-definition) refers to a method of trading securities, financial derivatives or foreign exchange electronically. Both buyers and sellers use the internet to connect to a trading platform such as an exchange-based system or electronic communication network (ECN).\n\n### 1.4 What do we need to predict?\n- Our challenge will be to use the historical data, mathematical tools, and technological tools at our disposal to create a model that gets as close to certainty as possible. We will be presented with a number of potential trading opportunities, which your model must choose whether to accept or reject. \n- So, if we generate a highly predictive model which selects the right trades to execute, we‚Äôll also be playing an important role in sending the market signals that push prices closer to ‚Äúfair‚Äù values. A better model will mean the market will be more efficient going forward.\n\n### 1.5 Metric: Utility-Score\n- In economics, [utility function](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/072915/what-utility-function-and-how-it-calculated.asp) is an important concept that measures preferences over a set of goods and services. Utility represents the satisfaction that consumers receive for choosing and consuming a product or service.Utility is measured in units called utils, but calculating the benefit or satisfaction that consumers receive from is abstract and difficult to pinpoint. As a result, economists measure utility in terms of revealed preferences by observing consumers' choices. From there, economists create an ordering of consumption baskets from least desired to the most preferred.\n- So, back to how this metric being used here,Each row in the test set represents a trading opportunity for which we will be predicting an action value, 1 to make the trade and 0 to pass on it. Each trade j has an associated weight and resp, which represents a return. For each date i, we define:\n\n<center> $ \\large p_{i} = \\Sigma_{j}(weight_{ij}‚àóresp_{ij}‚àóaction_{ij}) $ </center>\n\n\n<center> $ \\large t = \\frac{\\Sigma_{p_{i}}}{\\sqrt{\\Sigma p_{i}*p_{i}}} * \\sqrt{\\frac{250}{|i|}} $ </center>\n\nwhere |i| is the number of unique dates in the test set. The utility is then defined as:\n\n<center> $ \\large u = min(max(t,0),6)\\Sigma p_{i}  $ </center>"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 2. <a id='importing'>Importing the necessary librariesüìó</a> "},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nfrom os import listdir\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport glob\nimport tqdm\nfrom typing import Dict\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas_profiling as pdp\nimport json\n%matplotlib inline\nimport shapely.geometry as sg\nimport shapely.ops as so\nimport zipfile\nimport cv2\n\n#jane-street\nimport janestreet\nenv = janestreet.make_env() # initialize the environment\niter_test = env.iter_test() # an iterator which loops over the test set\n\n#plotly\n!pip install chart_studio\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport chart_studio.plotly as py\nimport plotly.graph_objs as go\nfrom plotly.offline import iplot\nimport cufflinks\ncufflinks.go_offline()\ncufflinks.set_config_file(world_readable=True, theme='pearl')\n\n#seaborn\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n#color\nfrom colorama import Fore, Back, Style\n\n#networkx\nimport networkx as nx\n\nimport seaborn as sns\nsns.set(style=\"whitegrid\")\n\n#tifffile\nfrom PIL import Image\nimport tifffile as tiff\nimport cv2\nfrom tqdm.notebook import tqdm\nimport zipfile\n\n# Suppress warnings \nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n# Settings for pretty nice plots\nplt.style.use('fivethirtyeight')\nplt.show()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 3. <a id='reading'>Reading the train.csv üìö</a>"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# List files available\nlist(os.listdir(\"../input/jane-street-market-prediction\"))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train = pd.read_csv('../input/jane-street-market-prediction/train.csv')\nfeatures = pd.read_csv('../input/jane-street-market-prediction/features.csv')\nex_test = pd.read_csv('../input/jane-street-market-prediction/example_test.csv')\nex_sub = pd.read_csv('../input/jane-street-market-prediction/example_sample_submission.csv')\nprint(Fore.YELLOW + 'Training data shape: ',Style.RESET_ALL,train.shape)\nprint(Fore.YELLOW + 'Features data shape: ',Style.RESET_ALL,features.shape)\nprint(Fore.YELLOW + 'Test data shape: ',Style.RESET_ALL,ex_test.shape)\ntrain.head()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"features.head(5)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"train.groupby(['date']).count()['resp'].to_frame()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 4.

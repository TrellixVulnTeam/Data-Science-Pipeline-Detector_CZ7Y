At the same time, [another notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/hkailee/eda-lung-shape-umap-clusters-comparison) of the data showed a lung-shaped UMAP of all the features, indicating two major \"lungs\"/clusters, with potentially some internal structure. \n\n## Experiment 1: TriMap of features 1-130\nWhat I wanted to check out below is whether if we run dimensionality reduction on all features **except feature 0**, in order to find the two major clusters as from the lung UMAP, will those two clusters correspond to the values of feature 0. I'll use TriMAP instead of UMAP for my investigation, but I expect we'll see similar clusters in the TriMAP space."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install trimap --quiet | cat","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"from typing import List\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport plotly.graph_objects as go\n\nimport trimap\n\n# Read the data\ntrain = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/jane-street-market-prediction/train.csv')\nprint(f\">> Done loading data.

To investigate a little further what effect `feature_0` has on the other features, I here try to solve the reverse problem of predicting `feature_0` based on features 1-130. I'll then remove the single most important feature (based off feature importance), and again check how well the remaining features can predict `feature_0`. By iteratively removing the most important feature, we can get a sense of how many features are required for predicting `feature_0`, and thereby how many features are 'related' to `feature_0`.\n\nThe reason for this approach rather than just looking at correlations between `feature_0` and `feature_x` is that we also want to consider possible non-linear effects, i.e. `feature_i` through `feature_j` together might in conjunction with each other be able to predict `feature_0`, but not by themselves."},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import lightgbm as lgb\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n\n# Reset X & y, just in case I'm running this cell multiple times\n# Only run on small subset for processing speed (I checked with \n# larger sample, and results are the same)\nsubset = train.sample(2000, random_state=2020)\nX = subset[FEATURES]\ny = subset['feature_0']\n\n# Iteratively remove most important feature & measure AUC score\ni, current_auc = 0, 1.0\nhistory = []\nwhile current_auc > 0.5 and len(X.columns) > 1:\n    \n    # Calculate CV scores\n    model = lgb.LGBMRegressor(n_estimators=100, n_jobs=1)\n    scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, scoring='roc_auc', n_jobs=-1)\n    current_auc = scores.mean()\n    \n    # Get the most important feature for the model\n    model = lgb.LGBMRegressor(n_estimators=100)\n    model.fit(X, y)\n\n    # Remove the best column\n    best_column = X.columns[np.argmax(model.feature_importances_)]\n    history.append((f'Iteration {i} - {best_column}', scores.mean()))\n    X = X.drop([best_column], axis=1)\n    \n    #print(f\">> Current AUC: {current_auc:.2f} -> Removing: {best_column}.
